    <h3> Speaker: Isabel Schnabel </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.92,0)"> Unequal scars – distributional consequences of the pandemic Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the panel discussion “Verteilung der Lasten der Pandemie”  , Deutscher Juristentag 2020 Frankfurt am Main, 18 September 2020 The coronavirus   pandemic is the most severe crisis in post-war history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.2,0)">It threatens the health of the population, poses enormous challenges to the healthcare system and is causing significant economic costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Within a short period of time, wide-ranging government support measures were introduced in an attempt to cushion some of the direct consequences of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.04,0)">In light of the enormous economic costs of the pandemic and the measures taken thus far, questions have been raised about how the economic burden of the crisis will be financed and distributed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.43,0)">The pandemic is a global shock that has hit all euro area countries almost simultaneously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.48,0)">Since then, however, it has become increasingly clear that the pandemic is having very different impacts on different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.64,0)">Those countries that already exhibited low growth and limited fiscal space before the crisis have been affected most severely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.44,0)">As a consequence, the pandemic threatens to exacerbate existing cross-country differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">However, differences are not only emerging between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Within countries, too, there are strong indications that pre-existing inequalities are being reinforced by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.31,0)">Lower-income individuals, those with lower levels of education as well as women and young people are affected the most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.46,0)">The common monetary policy of the European Central Bank   has limited means to counteract this type of divergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.57,0)">Instead, it is the task of fiscal policy to implement targeted measures to prevent the resulting inequality from turning into a structural phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.69,0)">Threat of divergence at country level Significant cross-country differences can already be identified when considering the development of COVID-19 cases over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.53,0)">The figures in Europe have been relatively benign by international standards, while North and South America, for instance, have reported considerably more dramatic increases in total infection numbers  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.35,0)">Figure 1 Total number of COVID-19 infections worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">Per million inhabitants Source: Bloomberg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.93,0)">Data are based on

Ministry of Health Singapore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Nevertheless, the situation within Europe is far from homogenous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.15,0)">In recent weeks, a particularly strong increase in active COVID-19 infections has been observed in Spain and France, while Germany and Italy have been recording low numbers, relative to the size of each country’s population  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.66,0)">Figure 2 Number of active COVID-19 infections in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">Per million inhabitants Source: Bloomberg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.85,0)">Counts are subject to change as governments survey and confirm cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.42,0)">Data are based on reported values as of midnight EST at each date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.77,0)">Based on population data as of 3 September 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.57,0)">Sources include Johns Hopkins University, World Health Organization, DXY, NHC, BNO News, European CDC, Italy Ministry of Health.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.76,0)">The economic fallout from the pandemic is severe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.08,0)">The lockdown measures imposed by governments led to a sharp decline in gross domestic product  , causing the euro area economy to contract by 11.8% in the second quarter  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.03,0)">While a strong recovery is expected in the third quarter, the most recent ECB staff projections estimate euro area GDP at end-2022 to be around 3% below the growth path that had been forecast as recently as March.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">It may therefore take years to completely overcome the economic damage caused by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.62,0)">Figure 3 Real Gross Domestic Product  : euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.36,0)">Index: 2019Q4 = 100 Source: ECB  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In this context, too, significant differences are observable across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.68,0)">While the European Commission’s forecast estimates that Germany’s GDP will fall by 6.3% in 2020, the contraction in GDP for France, Italy and Spain is expected to exceed 10%  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">It is unlikely that the resumption of economic growth in 2021 will significantly reduce these differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Risks of an increasing cross-country divergence in economic performance therefore continue to persist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Figure 4 Annual growth rate of real GDP: Germany, France, Italy, Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Percent Source: European Commission  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.66,0)">In this context, the economic consequences of the pandemic depend significantly on the severity of lockdown measures that were imposed in the first few months of the pandemic in order to contain the spread of the virus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.99,0)">There is a clear negative correlation between the extent of government-imposed restrictions, measured by the Oxford Stringency Index, and the fall in GDP projected for 2020  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.84,0)">However, the severity of the lockdown measures cannot fully explain the divergence in economic performance, as exemplified by the comparison between the Netherlands and Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Figure 5 Stringency of national crisis measures vs. projection of real GDP growth rate in 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.57,0)">Index, percent Source: European Commission  , University of Oxford.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.44,0)">Europe-wide travel restrictions and the drop in demand for travel abroad led to considerable economic losses in countries with a relatively high dependency on tourism, such as Greece or Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.62,0)">A correlation analysis shows that the projected drop in economic activity tends to be most pronounced in those countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Figure 6 Travel exports as a share of total services exports vs. projection of real GDP growth rate in 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.76,0)">Percent Source: European Commission  , Eurostat Balance of Payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.04,0)">Owing to differences in sectoral composition, the share of the workforce employed in sectors that are particularly affected by the restrictions varies significantly across countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">These structural factors have further reinforced differences in the impact of the pandemic on different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">In Spain and Italy, for example, the share of the workforce employed in sectors that are most affected by lockdown measures is particularly high, exceeding 30%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.57,0)">Figure 7 Share of employees in lockdown sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.35,0)">Percent Source: EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions  , 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.75,0)">Lockdown sectors are: wholesale and retail trade, repair of motor vehicles and motorcycles; transporting and storage; accommodation and food service activities; arts, entertainment and recreation   classification).</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Economic policy reaction: fiscal and monetary policy as complements Despite the magnitude of the economic downturn, unemployment has only increased marginally so far  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.59,0)">This partly results from a drop in labour market participation, given that some individuals currently do not actively seek employment due to social distancing rules or childcare duties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.76,0)">Moreover, euro area countries have implemented large-scale job retention programmes, thus preventing lay-offs and unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.69,0)">The German Kurzarbeitergeld   is an example of such a scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In the context of these government support programmes, significant heterogeneity across member countries is also apparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.55,0)">Nevertheless, due to these measures, a considerable increase in unemployment was most likely averted in all countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.96,0)">Figure 8 Unemployment rate and share of workers in job retention schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Percent Source: Eurostat; Bundesagentur für Arbeit and ifo Institute Munich; Ministère du Travail, de L’Emploi et de L’Insertion; INPS; Ministerio de Inclusión, Seguridad Social y Migraciones, and ECB staff computations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.69,0)">Latest observation: July 2020 for the unemployment rate; July 2020 for the number of workers in ERTE in Spain; June 2020 for the number of workers in Kurzarbeit in Germany and Activité Partielle in France; May 2020 for the number of workers in Cassa Integrazione in Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">In addition to job retention schemes, euro area countries have launched a large number of further fiscal measures to support households and companies in the wake of the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The resulting funding needs will lead to a considerable medium-term increase in public debt levels in all euro area countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Figure 9 Public debt in the euro area in 2019 vs. projection for 2021 Percent of GDP Source: European Commission  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.24,0)">The impact of the pandemic has been particularly harsh in those countries that had already incurred a high level of public debt before the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.08,0)">A high level of public debt limits the scope for fiscal stimulus measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.14,0)">In this context, a widely shared concern at the start of the crisis was that the fiscal response in these countries would be insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.91,0)">Indeed, a negative correlation between the extent of the fiscal stimulus measures and the severity of the expected economic contraction was initially observed  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.1,0)">It should also be highlighted that the stronger impact of the coronavirus crisis in these countries had not, or only to a limited extent, been caused by misguided government policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Figure 10 Projection of real GDP growth rate in 2020 and fiscal stimulus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Percent Source: European Commission  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Fiscal stimulus estimates are based on data published by the European Commission  , the most recent harmonised projection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.84,0)">These estimates therefore do not include the latest announcements of fiscal support measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.8,0)">Fiscal stimulus is calculated as the change in the primary deficit, adjusted for cyclical effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.94,0)">Since the crisis hit Europe, concerns about increasing fragmentation in the euro area have also dominated financial market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.62,0)">In March, monetary policy was faced with a rapidly deteriorating market environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.38,0)">Investors fled to the safest securities and asset classes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.27,0)">Risk premia in other market segments rose dramatically, liquidity dried up, and financing conditions worsened considerably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.2,0)">Companies were confronted with acute liquidity shortages as revenues plummeted abruptly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.68,0)">The composite indicator of systemic stress   used by the ECB suggests that the European financial sector was most likely facing an imminent and severe financial crisis, which was only averted by a decisive and swift policy response on the part of the ECB  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Most notably, the measures comprised the provision of abundant liquidity to banks at extremely favourable conditions, as well as a temporary asset purchase programme tailored specifically to the pandemic crisis – the pandemic emergency purchase programme  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The design of the PEPP allows asset purchases to be distributed flexibly over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The announcement of PEPP had an immediate and calming effect on financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.88,0)">Figure 11 Indicator for systemic stress in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.1,0)">Index Source: ECB

PEPP effectively countered risks of fragmentation in European financial markets, which would have prevented the smooth transmission of our monetary policy measures to the entire euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.05,0)">Risk premia in European government bond markets declined markedly and have reverted approximately to their pre-crisis levels  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This had a direct impact on the funding costs for households and enterprises in the euro area, thereby cushioning the economic impact of the crisis.</span><span

Source: Bloomberg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.03,0)">Latest observation: 16 September 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">However, risk premia on government bonds did not decrease solely because of the monetary policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In addition, the agreement on a large-scale rescue package at European level contributed to a normalisation of risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The fiscal support measures comprising loans and transfers were essential in reducing risk premia to their pre-crisis levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The agreement on the rescue package was not merely a sign of European solidarity during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.12,0)">It was also recognition of the fact that a substantial divergence in economic performance would ultimately be detrimental to all European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As a consequence, the funds should primarily benefit those countries that were most affected by the crisis and only have limited fiscal space available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Unlike in the global financial crisis and the European sovereign debt crisis, a decisive European response was implemented quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Unlike back then, monetary and fiscal policy are today acting in a complementary manner and are reinforcing each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This policy response made it possible to effectively counter what is undoubtedly the most severe economic crisis in living memory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.49,0)">Rising inequality as a result of the pandemic The crisis has not only left scars of varying depth at the country level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.92,0)">The consequences of government-imposed lockdown measures can also be differentiated according to the socioeconomic characteristics of the affected individuals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Based on empirical data, a number of recent academic studies consider the social consequences of the pandemic at an individual level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.25,0)">The findings of these studies suggest that the lockdown measures had a particularly marked impact on sectors in which work under physical distancing rules was difficult or almost impossible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Data for the euro area show that the share of employees in the most affected sectors increases notably in income  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.29,0)">Figure 13 Share of employees in lockdown sectors by income quintiles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.54,0)">Percent Source: EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions  , 2018; Ireland and Slovakia 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">In a recent study, Mongey et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.09,0)">use US data to show that employees in lockdown sectors typically have lower levels of education, lower incomes and lower savings than employees outside of the sectors directly affected by these measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Beland et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">obtain similar results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.18,0)">Social distancing rules could thus contribute to an increase in income inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Chetty et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.72,0)">find that particularly large job losses in the United States occurred in companies that operate in lockdown industries and offer personal services catering to high-income households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.0,0)">To a large extent, these job losses affected low-income employees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.26,0)">This finding also suggests that government-imposed lockdown measures could increase inequality further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Indeed, Furceri et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">show that previous pandemics had the effect of amplifying income inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">These consequences of the crisis are relevant from a macroeconomic – and monetary policy – perspective because patterns of consumption and savings differ greatly across various income groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.05,0)">Whereas individuals located at lower levels of the income distribution spend most of their income on basic necessities, the shares of savings and consumer spending that could be postponed during the crisis is particularly high at the top of the income distribution  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.72,0)">An increase in inequality therefore has an impact on the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color:

services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.33,0)">Red bars denote postponable spending items, such as purchases of motor vehicles, clothing and footwear, and furnishings and furniture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Green bars show household saving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The chart shows an aggregate of Germany, Spain and France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.87,0)">Furthermore, the impact of the lockdown measures is also associated with individuals’ education level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.27,0)">In the Netherlands, for example, sectors with a higher share of work hours spent in home office during the crisis tend to have a higher proportion of employees with tertiary education  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.26,0)">Employees in these sectors are presumably less affected by short-time work schemes and income shortfalls, given that they were able to continue working from home during the pandemic period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.16,0)">Figure 15 Share of workers with tertiary education vs. share

lockdown measures could also lead to a worsening of inequality for individuals who are still in school.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">For example, during the period of home schooling in the wake of the pandemic, students from US districts with higher average household incomes earned a higher number of badges for completing online courses relative to those from districts with lower incomes  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.67,0)">The observed dispersion of learning outcomes is primarily problematic because it could lead to lasting differences in human capital accumulation, thus causing inequality to increase in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.44,0)">Figure 16 Students’ performance by estimated household income in the

style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Finally, recent studies also indicate that the effects of lockdown measures can also be differentiated in terms of individuals’ age and gender.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.64,0)">On the one hand, the share of young employees in sectors that have been particularly affected by the government-imposed containment measures is relatively high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.21,0)">On the other hand, women across almost all age groups are more heavily affected by the restrictions than men  .</span><span

of the lockdown measures that were implemented in many countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.62,0)">A renewed surge in infection numbers could result in such measures being reintroduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Fuchs-Schündeln et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.93,0)">estimate that, in Germany, up to 11% of employees could be forced to stop working and stay at home instead in case school closures are extended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Adams et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.03,0)">present survey data indicating that childcare duties imposed a much larger burden on women during the coronavirus crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Alon et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.11,0)">conclude that women in particular will have to cope with substantial financial losses as a result of the additional burden due to childcare duties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.23,0)">It is likely that single mothers with low incomes are particularly affected by such losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.67,0)">Collectively, the available evidence is consistent in concluding that government-imposed lockdown measures primarily affect people in lower income brackets, younger employees and women, especially those with children childcare duties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The containment measures are thus at least temporarily contributing to a reinforcement of existing social inequalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.79,0)">Closing remarks I would now like to conclude my remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.68,0)">The COVID-19 pandemic has affected different parts of our society in different ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.24,0)">The heterogeneous evolution of case numbers resulted in lockdown measures of varying stringency, which were in part contingent on the sectoral composition of individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.67,0)">As a result, the economic impact of the containment measures was more severe in some countries than in others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The decisive measures taken by fiscal policy makers at national and European level as well as the ECB’s monetary policy will help to mitigate a looming economic divergence between individual European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">It will be essential to find a common European response to these shared challenges, and to implement it on the basis of the ground-breaking decisions taken at the EU summit in July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The funds available under the Next Generation EU instrument should be used to strengthen the growth potential of all countries in a sustainable manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">In this context, measures to foster the transition of the economy to green and digital technologies should play a central role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">At the same time, such measures can permanently reduce differences among individual euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">This is also beneficial for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">A lower degree of divergence in economic developments within the euro area increases the effectiveness of monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Completing the architecture of the euro area would also facilitate the implementation of adequate European responses to common crises in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In a survey commissioned by the European Parliament, 69% of respondents indicate that they would support additional competences for European authorities in responding to a crisis like the coronavirus pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Within countries, the impact of the crisis was by no means uniform either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.99,0)">In this context, disadvantaged individuals – including those with low incomes and education levels, younger workers and women – were far more heavily affected by the containment measures than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.02,0)">However, an increase in inequality as a result of the crisis is not inevitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Fiscal policy is able to provide targeted support to specific industries and social groups who bear a particularly heavy burden due to the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Such support is not only about redistribution, but also about empowerment of individuals to cope with the inevitable structural change caused by the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Education and family policy are likely to play an important role in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.4,0)">Within the remit of its mandate, monetary policy can have an impact on social inequality to the extent that its measures benefit lower income groups, given that these groups are most heavily affected by job losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Beyond this effect, monetary policy does not possess targeted instruments to mitigate the distributional ramifications of the crisis on an individual level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In the long run, the key objective should be to prevent permanent scarring effects due to a structural entrenchment of inequalities emerging in the context of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color:
