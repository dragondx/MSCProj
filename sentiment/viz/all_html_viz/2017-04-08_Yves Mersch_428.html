    <span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)"> Remarks on the future of economic governance in Europe and the euro Introductory remarks by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at panel “The Agenda for Europe”, at Ambrosetti's Finance Forum on 'The Outlook for the Economy and Finance', Villa d’Este, Cernobbio, 8 April 2017 In a year of anniversaries – the sixtieth anniversary of the Rome Treaty and the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Maastricht Treaty –, our Union finds itself amidst a debate about its raison d’être and its future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Earlier this week, the EU commission discussed in Strasbourg “a road map towards a complete Economic and Monetary Union in 2025” as part of a “reflection paper”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In January, the high-level group on own resources   chaired by Mario Monti has been presented in the European Parliament and in the Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">It is reflecting on finding more transparent, simple, fair and democratically accountable ways to finance the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And we are approaching the second stage of the “Five Presidents’ report” with the aim of completing the architecture of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As a central banker, I will focus on the state of economic governance in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I will first share some considerations on what has been achieved so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">I will then discuss how we could further improve the functioning of our Economic and Monetary Union in the future and invigorate trust and support from European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The key role of monetary policy in stabilising the euro area economy As the central bank issuing the euro, we are responsible for the stability of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Our monetary policy measures played a key role in stabilising the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The European Central Bank acted decisively by deploying a range of conventional and unconventional monetary policy measures, allowing to reduce financial fragmentation, avoid deflation, and support price stability and thereby the economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">While an effective lower bound for short-term interest rates exists, monetary policy, shifted to steering medium to long-term rates despite of its higher dependency on international capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The ECB employed non-standard measures including forward guidance and asset purchases to deal with the lower bound constraint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">These instruments have been effective in narrowing spreads   and lowering the exchange rates, thus supporting the ongoing recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Shortcomings in other policy fields delayed the recovery The economic outlook has significantly improved since the peak of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The recovery has strengthened and broadened across sectors and countries and the balance of risks is within a whisker of being called balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Growth of GDP per capita was in fact higher in the euro area last year than in any other major advanced economies in the G7.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.25,0)">And unemployment has declined to 9.5% in February 2017, the lowest level since May 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.41,0)">The output gap should be closing within the policy horizon; NAIRU at the same time has been revised downwards - for those who love unobservables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">But to reap the full benefits of our monetary policy, it needs to be complemented by sound economic and fiscal policies at national and European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.42,0)">To the extent that fiscal and economic policies did not provide the necessary cyclical support and tackle decisively enough structural drivers of the crisis, the monetary policy reaction is more extended and forceful with the negative consequences as would have been the case in a healthier environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Therefore, there is a need to improve economic and fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">This implies both more decisive action by national governments and full implementation of the strengthened institutional framework of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The improved financial and economic architecture of EMU Since the onset of the crisis, many of the shortcomings in the financial and economic architecture of Economic and Monetary Union have indeed been overcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Economic governance has been strengthened by enhancing the Stability and Growth Pact whilst introducing a framework for macroeconomic surveillance to identify and address macroeconomic imbalances as well as declining competitiveness through the so-called six-pack and two-pack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Further steps were also taken towards improving budgetary coordination among Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.05,0)">However, the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact has proven to be dysfunctional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">The creation of the European Stability Mechanism   provided a tool for crisis resolution at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">The establishment of Banking Union was a further essential step for safeguarding financial stability in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Regarding the regulatory treatment of sovereign exposures, it was agreed to await the outcomes of the Basel Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Following the work of the Basel Committee the Council will consider possible next steps in the European context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In the long run we certainly need to realize that a zero-risk weight for sovereign cannot hold a reality check.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.41,0)">Moreover, the acknowledgement of sovereign debt restructuring as a real possibility requires deeper reflections on sovereign debt restructuring mechanism for the euro area and would underpin the credibility on of the no bailout clause.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.68,0)">As experience has shown, “the constructive ambiguity” with respect to the market interpretation of the no bailout clause embedded in the Treaties has not really been effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The ESM could play a larger role in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Capital Markets Union is a natural complement to the Banking Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">It aims at promoting financial integration and enhancing shock absorption via financial markets by facilitating private risk-sharing whilst reducing opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">CMU should also support the smooth and homogenous transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">A number of concrete measures are listed in the Commission’s Action Plan to strengthen: Securitisation, insolvency regimes, and tax legislation need to be prioritised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Cross-border barriers to clearing and settlement should be removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">I welcome the commission’s communication on accelerating the CMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Swift implementation is of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Implementation of promises and adherence to new rules is key As a result of these measures, our economic and monetary union is considerably more resilient today than it was at the peak of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The strengthening of the recovery in the past year, in spite of challenges on several fronts, is testimony to that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Yet the strengthened framework can only deliver stability over the longer term if national governments keep their promises and adhere to the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">For economic and fiscal policies this means: Structural reforms are necessary to raise productivity and improve the business environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Fiscal policies should be designed so that they support the economic recovery by focussing on productivity-enhancing measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">At the same time, fiscal rules need to be respected to build confidence in the sustainability of national finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">More decisive action by national governments and respect for the rules that we have commonly agreed on is essential for a stronger and safer Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">It is also a vital prerequisite for any further move towards shared fiscal sovereignty in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The Five Presidents’ report has outlined a vision for improving the architecture of EMU and provides a roadmap for completing political and fiscal union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Let me share with you some considerations on frequently floated ideas: In the long run, sound fiscal policies at national level could be accompanied by the establishment of a euro area fiscal capacity with own resources, central control of spending and democratic control on the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">This would provide a European automatic stabiliser and could allow financing European public goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This would lead in the direction of the practice of federations, where spending on functions such as defence or R&D is to a large extent centralised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.12,0)">This however would require Treaty changes and raises the question about a Transfer Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.22,0)">For both, the appetite of governments and people is currently very low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Furthermore, a pooling of fiscal resources, whatever their nature and size might be, only works if solidarity goes hand in hand with shared responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Likewise, greater risk sharing in the fiscal realm presupposes sufficient economic convergence among participating countries and the sustainability of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And where competences are assigned to the European level, they should be part of the Union method, with clear executive powers, full democratic accountability and rigorous judicial arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.85,0)">Conversely, we should avoid creating the wrong impression about what the Union can do: loose coordination at European level may give the impression that a competence has been passed to the European level, when in fact it continues to be dominated by the power play among Member States which is a pattern that has consistently failed to pacify the European continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.7,0)">This perceived ineffectiveness further contributes to the loss of trust and credibility of EU institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Therefore, responsibilities and accountability should be more clearly defined and aligned, similar to the monetary policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I am aware that the attention of our policy-makers currently lies more on security needs than completing Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.36,0)">Some of these proposals may also require Treaty change for which there may be little appetite at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">But we should also not forget that Europe will be better able to protect itself if it has a strong economy allowing it to address the concerns of Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Ultimately, stability, prosperity and security are interlinked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Not only between these three objectives of the Union but also across European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">We have common interests – and also common values –, which means there is no reason we should not see our identity and sovereignty as also European.</span>
