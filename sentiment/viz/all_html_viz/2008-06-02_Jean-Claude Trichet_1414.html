    <span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)"> Address at the ceremony to mark the 10th anniversary of the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB2 June 2008 in Frankfurt am Main Mr President of the Republic, Sehr geehrte Frau Bundeskanzlerin, Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the European Union, Mr President of the European Commission, Mr President of the Eurogroup, Ministers, Excellencies, fellow Governors, Ladies and gentlemen, Ten years ago, on 1 June 1998, the European Central Bank was founded, together with the European System of Central Banks, the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The primary mandate of the ECB and the ESCB was, and is, to preserve price stability and to safeguard the credibility of Europe's single currency, the euro, which was created seven months later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It was the will of the democracies of Europe that led to the creation of the ECB Its mandate and its independence in fulfilling its mandate were given by the people of Europe on a multi-national and multi-partisan basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">We are faithful to our mandate because we are faithful to the democratic will of the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Jean Monnet writes in his Mémoires: “Rien n’est possible sans les hommes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Rien n’est durable sans les institutions”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">“Nothing is possible without people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Nothing is lasting without institutions.” The ECB is, in my opinion, a remarkable illustration of the lucidity of the conceptual founder of the Community: the institutional construction is solid and has proved to be remarkably effective in attaining its goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">This ten-year period has been short compared with the duration of the deepening of the European Union, which is an historic endeavour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">But this relatively short period of time has been rich in successes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">These accomplishments call for celebration, for reflection and also for continuous efforts as regards the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In the first place, celebration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">My predecessor, our dear Wim Duisenberg, in his speech to celebrate the establishment of the ESCB ten years ago, referred to “the road we have to travel in the future to make the euro a success, which means to make it a stable currency”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.02,0)">What can we say now, after ten years?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.18,0)">I can sum it up in five sentences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Since day one, the single currency has fully inherited the degree of credibility and confidence that was the privilege of the most credible national currencies before the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.74,0)">The credibility was such that the medium and long-term market rates of the euro were at the same low level as those experienced by the most reliable national currencies before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.18,0)">In spite of a series of global shocks resulting from the prices of oil and commodities, yearly inflation since 1 January 1999 has been 2.1% on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Price stability in the medium term is essential not only because it protects the incomes of all our fellow citizens – and particularly the most vulnerable and poorest ones – but also because it is one of the preconditions for growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.23,0)">Since the euro came into being 15.7 million new jobs have been created, over one million more than on the other side of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The euro has been a remarkable success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.17,0)">I don't intend to name and shame those who said that Europe's single currency would be impossible, or that its introduction would be a failure, or that it would be impossible for it to inherit the best previous credibility levels, or that fault lines in its construction would lead to a permanently weak currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">A success indeed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Europeans have achieved what was deemed impossible, what had never been tried.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">As Tocqueville said: “L’histoire est une galerie de tableaux dans laquelle il y a peu d’originaux et beaucoup de copies”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.48,0)">“History is a gallery of pictures in which there are few originals and many copies.” The single currency of Europe is indeed an original, according to Tocqueville's definition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is a time for celebration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.34,0)">This is also a time for reflection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.88,0)">The first ten years have been extremely busy for the Executive Board, for the Governing Council, for the ECB and for the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">The extraordinary motivation of our staff members is, in my opinion, due to their awareness of, and pride in, making history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And on the subject of history, I would like to make some observations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Europe's single currency has ancient roots: apart from the single currency of the Roman Empire, two thousand years ago, I could mention George of Podebrady, a king of Bohemia in the 15th century, who called for a common currency for Europe, or Victor Hugo's call for a single market with a single currency in Europe in the 19th century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">By implementing the Economic and Monetary Union enshrined in the Werner report 38 years ago, we have also achieved a much older plan, an ancient vision of a unified continent, including monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This historic vision has always been closely associated with the search for prosperity and the preservation of peace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Il nous appartient de donner forme à ce destin.” A “common destiny”: the words of the man with whom General de Gaulle achieved reconciliation after so many conflicts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These words apply even more to the countries belonging to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">In the ECB and in the Eurosystem we are fully convinced that, with our fellow citizens, 320 million of them, we share a destiny in common – wir teilen dasselbe Schicksal – nous partageons un destin en commun.</span>
