    <span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)"> Welcome message at the Annual General Assembly of the Manufacturers’ Association of Israel   Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBTel Aviv, 21 January 2010 Dear President Brosh, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure for me to extend a welcome message to the Annual General Assembly of the Manufacturers’ Association of Israel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.58,0)">Your meeting is taking place in challenging times for the global, European and Israeli economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.53,0)">Not surprisingly, Israel, as a very open economy, has been adversely affected by the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">I also note that the Israeli economy has been quite resilient compared with other advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Israel can rightfully take pride in its recent economic performance, as well as in its achievements in economic development more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Your country has close economic ties with Europe and is highly integrated into the global economy, so I think it would be useful to consider two questions: what is the outlook for the euro area economy; and what are the lessons of the global financial crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">In the euro area, real GDP growth in the third quarter of last year returned to positive territory following five quarters of contraction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We expect the euro area economy to grow at a moderate pace in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.72,0)">I should add, though, that the recovery process is likely to be uneven, and the outlook remains subject to high uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The upside and downside risks are broadly balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">On the upside, there may be stronger than anticipated effects stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus that has been provided by the authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Confidence may also improve further and foreign trade may recover more strongly than projected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.15,0)">On the downside, concerns remain as regards negative interactions between the real economy and the financial sector, which may be stronger or more protracted than expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.6,0)">Renewed increases in oil and other commodity prices, the intensification of protectionist pressures and disruptive market movements related to the correction of global external imbalances remain other downside risks for economic developments in the euro area and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Budget deficits in euro area countries must be reduced in a timely fashion to maintain confidence in public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Avoiding protectionism and disruptive market movements related to global imbalances will require a high degree of international cooperation among policy makers in advanced and emerging market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.39,0)">This brings me to my second point: what are the lessons of the financial crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.95,0)">Given the magnitude and the negative spillovers of the financial crisis on economic growth, on unemployment and on public finances, the citizens in our countries will not forgive us, if we fail to draw the right lessons from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">In my view, there are three main lessons to be learnt: first, the need to build a more resilient financial sector, second, the need for fully coordinated measures to that end at the global level, and third, the need for all systemic economies to embark on sound macroeconomic policies over the medium and long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.51,0)">The epicentre of the crisis was located in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Therefore the global financial system has to be made more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Current efforts are under way, and the focus must now be on implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.58,0)">This concerns both financial regulation as well as oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">In the EU, financial sector supervision is on the way to be strengthened in a two-pronged approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">A European System of Financial Supervisors will be established to permit better coordination among national authorities that oversee financial regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And a European Systemic Risk Board will be responsible for macro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This new body will provide early warnings and issue recommendations to help prevent any renewed build-up of excessive risk in the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">These measures are not the end of the road on regulatory and supervisory reform, but, once implemented, a significant step forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Although they are aimed at the financial sector, they will serve the economy as a whole, not least manufacturers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">The manufacturing industry has a stake in a stable and resilient financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.19,0)">The crisis has revealed the very high level of interconnectedness of the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">This constitutes a compelling case for very close international cooperation and solutions at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">There is an overwhelming need to implement global reforms in a coordinated fashion and along the same concepts, in order to preserve a global level playing field that would be solid and resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Finally, the crisis has again stressed the need for all policy-makers to contribute to financial, macroeconomic and price stability over the medium and long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">In the area of monetary policy, a sound legal and institutional framework for central banks promotes medium-term and stability orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The primary mandate of the ECB is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To fulfil this mandate, the ECB and national central banks are institutions whose independence is firmly enshrined in law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This framework has been crucial to anchoring inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">It has also facilitated our task of maintaining price stability in the euro area, both at times of heightened inflationary pressures and at times of deflationary risks stemming from financial distress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">I am convinced that a clear commitment to price stability by independent central banks has beneficial effects in countries and regions all over the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me conclude by saying that business is, by its very nature, an act of trust, an expression of confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is all the more true in the manufacturing industry, where decisions on investment are often made with a long time horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Confidence is exactly what has been short in supply during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Central banks have to be anchors of stability and confidence – and not only in turbulent times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">When the crisis unfolded, they reacted swiftly and decisively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">This was true worldwide, including in Europe as well as in Israel under the leadership of my colleague Stanley Fischer, with whom I enjoy an extremely confident and friendly relationship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">By solidly anchoring expectations of price stability over the medium term, central banks are consolidating confidence and contributing to a sustainable recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">I wish you a successful meeting and thank you for your attention.</span>
