    <h3> Speaker: Jürgen Stark </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)"> The global financial crisis and the role of central banking Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Institute of Regulation & Risk, North Asia, Hong Kong, 12 April 2011 It is a pleasure for me to address this distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In my remarks today, I would like to share some thoughts with you on how the global financial crisis could shape central banking in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.82,0)">Crises are often associated with deep-seated changes in both the mandates and functions of central banks – this is a well-established regularity in contemporary economic history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.63,0)">For example, central bank inaction was widely held responsible for worsening the economic downturn during the Great Depression of the 1930s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.91,0)">The result was that monetary policy was placed under the control of fiscal authorities for nearly two decades afterwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.17,0)">The Great Inflation of the 1970s had the opposite effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The failure of weak monetary regimes to reign in high inflation led to the establishment, in the early 1980s, of monetary policy frameworks solidly anchored by price stability mandates, and safeguarded by independent and autonomous central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.89,0)">Will this crisis – which is still ongoing – have any implications for the tasks of central banks in the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">To shed light on this question, I will, first of all, look back on the salient features of the monetary policy paradigm prevailing before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Then I will review how central banks responded in practice to the crisis, focusing on the ECB’s policy actions in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And finally, I will discuss whether certain aspects of the pre-crisis monetary policy paradigm need to be reassessed on the basis of the recent experience, and outline the likely challenges for central banks that lie ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.63,0)">*** The monetary policy paradigm before the crisis We do not know yet to what extent the pre-crisis consensus macroeconomic framework has been de-constructed by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.24,0)">But we do know that the ‘hubris’ of the intellectual paradigm on which that framework was erected has completely vanished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Some aspects of the framework, in my view, will undoubtedly survive the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">One is the great and increasingly shared emphasis on central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Another is the centrality of price stability for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These were the twin foundations of the dominant monetary policy paradigm before the crisis, and the crisis has not challenged or discredited either of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I will return to the issue of price stability towards the end of my remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Beyond these considerations, other aspects of the international consensus framework merit some careful re-evaluation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In particular, I will take this opportunity to share my thoughts on two salient features of the monetary policy paradigm as described in a number of pre-crisis studies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.9,0)">One was complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The ‘great moderation’ of the 1990s appeared to have inflation permanently under control and conveyed the impression that the monetary policy battles of yesteryear had been won once and for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.16,0)">This sense of security was highly consequential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Some observers thought that monetary policy had a greater freedom to turn to other purposes, notably short-term demand management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.94,0)">Policy practitioners of this view referred to this as ‘fine-tuning’  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The theoretical counterpart to this was a form of ‘flexible inflation targeting’ with an added emphasis on output stabilisation beyond inflation stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Simplifying, one can express the inflation targeting policy advice in two main precepts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.79,0)">First, look at inflation and output gap forecasts as summary statistics of the state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Second, fine-tune the policy instrument so that inflation forecasts – whatever the nature of the shocks that might have caused them – are stabilised, and output volatility is minimised, at a pre-set horizon through a given interest rate path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.02,0)">It is easy to conceive of economic conditions in which these prescriptions induce destabilising action on the side of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.58,0)">Indeed, limiting the information set to inflation and output gap forecasts can be highly misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.15,0)">One reason for this has been known for a long time: output gaps are ill-defined objects and are subject to a great deal of measurement error.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.1,0)">An imperfectly understood concept which – in addition – is statistically very imprecisely measured is not a reliable indicator for guiding policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.08,0)">Paradoxically, with its focus on the output gap, pre-crisis consensus macroeconomics ran full circle back to the intellectual climate of the 1970s, the same climate that had favoured the Great Inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.56,0)">The major policy failures of the 1970s were largely due to policymakers’ exaggerated real-time measures of economic slack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.55,0)">The second distinctive feature of the pre-crisis monetary policy paradigm stemmed from a complete under-appreciation of the role of money and credit indicators in the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Liquidity and money lie at the core of the ECB’s second pillar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.72,0)">But they were at best ignored, at worst ‘derided’, as redundant and unnecessary complications by mainstream modellers before 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The crisis has shown that liquidity and various definitions of money are critical links in the transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.27,0)">Far from showing a lack of theoretical foundations in the ECB’s strategy, the crisis has exposed the incompleteness of the transmission mechanism in the reference model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.16,0)">But disregard for monetary and financial phenomena had another implication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">It found a clear counterpart and theoretical underpinning in the risk management approach to asset price trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The consensus view in pre-crisis times was that the best thing that central banks could do was to ‘clean-up’ following the bursting of a bubble by loosening the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.9,0)">I do not need to underline how this approach can turn into a formidable multiplier of market turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">The expectation that the central bank will aggressively protect the markets from ‘tail events’ in bad times can encourage – and did encourage, in my view – markets’ tendency to opt for risky strategies, over-exposures and exuberance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.66,0)">In summary, there was an inherent contradiction in some of the salient features of the pre-crisis monetary policy paradigm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">On the one hand, central bank policy ‘activism’ was seen as justified in order to help with short-term output stabilisation purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.15,0)">Yet activism did not apply to financial risks except in an entirely ex post fashion: proponents of policy ‘activism’ saw no merit in a central bank’s ex ante intervention to stem asset price developments, arguing that the policy interest rate was too blunt a tool to contain potential bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Central bank response to the crisis and ‘the new normal’ The central bank response to the crisis, by any metric, has been unprecedented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">When tensions in the interbank market emerged in the euro area and elsewhere in August 2007, the ECB reacted swiftly by providing de facto unlimited overnight liquidity to limit euro area banks’ liquidity risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">As the tensions morphed into a large-scale crisis of confidence in October 2008, the ECB responded with a mix of standard and non-standard monetary policy actions to foster financing conditions and enhance its credit support to the euro area economy, all with a view to maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.61,0)">The standard measures essentially entailed a steep reduction of the main refinancing rate to a historical low of 1% over a seven-month period  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.07,0)">This was done in reaction to the weak economic environment and the associated change in the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The non-standard measures included granting banks unlimited access to central bank liquidity against an extended range of collateral with the possibility for banks to borrow liquidity at a broader spectrum of maturities, of up to 12 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.13,0)">The ECB also intervened directly in some market segments that were dysfunctional, namely the covered bonds market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">This was deemed important for the long-term financing of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.49,0)">In May 2010 the financial crisis took a different direction; markets started to question the sustainability of public finances in parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.5,0)">In response, the ECB intervened in some debt securities markets, in order to prevent large and important segments of the securitised credit market seizing up and obstructing monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.4,0)">These interventions have been limited in size, and their impact on liquidity creation has been fully sterilised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Overall, the non-standard measures have been adopted with a view to ensuring the transmission of low policy rates to the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">They have been tailored to the specific financial structure of the euro area economy, whose financing to a large extent relies on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">These measures are fully in line with the ECB’s price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.3,0)">In this regard, the approach chosen by the ECB and the Eurosystem differs from that of other major central banks which embarked on large-scale unconventional measures to replace, rather than complement, standard actions, after those standard actions – changes in the policy interest rate – had reached their lower limit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In this respect, the ECB’s non-standard response does not qualify as a form of quantitative easing or credit easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Non-standard monetary policy measures are an extraordinary response to exceptional circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.17,0)">They are, by construction, temporary in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Looking ahead, a return to a more normal liquidity management and to a more moderate scale of central bank intermediation is warranted to avoid distortions in financial incentives with longer-term adverse consequences for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.99,0)">The ECB started in fact to phase out a number of non-standard measures back in late 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The maintenance of price stability over the medium term guides all monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In this respect, the macroeconomic and financial landscape has fundamentally changed and the monetary policy stance has become more accommodative than at the peak of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As with the phasing-in of non-standard measures, there are no pre-defined steps between phasing them out and exiting from very low policy interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Non-standard measures can in fact co-exist with any interest rate level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">The ECB will adjust its policy interest rates and its provision of liquidity at a pace and to a degree commensurate with the evolution of risks to price stability and as appropriate to maintain an orderly and functional monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">A number of key principles, which served the ECB well both before and during the crisis, will continue to underlie the post-crisis ‘steady state’ design of the ECB’s operational framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">These principles are: operational efficiency, a strong market orientation, simplicity and transparency, and equal treatment of our counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In line with these principles, the ECB equipped itself with a broad operational framework from the outset, including the eligibility of a large number of counterparties and a wide set of collateral in refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">At the same time, the post-crisis operational framework also needs to be designed in a way that contributes to shaping a healthy banking sector, even if proper incentives should essentially come from sound regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The future of central banking and main challenges ahead What are the desirable features of a post-crisis ‘steady state’ monetary policy framework?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">On this subject, I would like to make a number of points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">As I mentioned already, the ‘core’ elements of the monetary policy paradigm have emerged from the crisis unscathed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">I firmly believe that price stability is the best contribution that monetary authorities can make to overall economic welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Price stability should remain the primary task and the key ‘deliverable’ for central banks in the period ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">If anything, the crisis has reaffirmed the importance of having a clearly defined objective for price stability, not least by contributing to the anchoring of expectations during periods of turbulence, when otherwise the private sector would become disoriented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Central bank independence under a specific mandate together with transparent communication policies will continue to be instrumental in the pursuit of price stability by monetary authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Other aspects of the pre-crisis monetary policy paradigm need to be carefully re-examined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">The crisis should mark a clean break with short-termism and ‘fine-tuning’ demand management by monetary authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.52,0)">An insufficient medium-term orientation and a systematic asymmetry in responding to shocks – with downside risks to the economy always receiving a greater weight in central bankers’ ‘policy preferences’ than upside risks to price stability – all of this contributed to the build-up of financial imbalances in some advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.14,0)">The sudden unwinding of these imbalances set in motion the chain of events which we now call ‘the crisis’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Greater medium-term orientation in monetary policy frameworks would have made the events which followed less severe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.1,0)">Monetary data are critical as indicators of risks that are slow to appear elsewhere, for example, in inflation forecasts or in measures of output gaps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.94,0)">Monetary analysis at the ECB has consistently sent early signals that risk was broadly under-priced, when inflation was quiescent and measures of slack were moderate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Incorporating monetary phenomena in the policy framework inspires a sort of ‘leaning-against-the wind’ stance which can help smooth financial cycles and stabilise the economy in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.79,0)">Coupled with the inescapable fact that inflation is a monetary phenomenon in the long term, this is a powerful reason to redress the under-appreciation of monetary and credit variables in policy frameworks characteristic of the policy paradigm in the run-up to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">The crisis has shown that central banks have powerful instruments at their disposal to effectively respond to extraordinary situations without compromising their ultimate objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.85,0)">However, this does not mean that monetary policy is liable to be subordinated to financial stability concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.52,0)">The ECB is well aware of the possibility of monetary policy being ‘contaminated’ by financial stability considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Monetary policy – even in crises and, I would say, particularly in crises – is about lending temporarily to solvent institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.25,0)">Lending to institutions which have long-lasting, structural funding and equity problems is the responsibility of the fiscal authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.43,0)">The limits to what monetary policy could and should credibly do are both conceptual and practical: monetary authorities cannot be expected to solve issues which lie well outside their official remit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There are two sides to this simple truth, one concerning financial regulation and one broad economic management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">On the financial side, the ECB has a major stake in the quest for financial stability – but the authority lies elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Basel III is a very important step in the right direction, as it should provide for higher minimum capital requirements and better risk capture by financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But in addition to the progressive roll-out of this framework and its incorporation into domestic law, the treatment of systemically important financial institutions and risk capture by the shadow banking sector remains to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">It is important to achieve a level playing field in these areas and that bodies such as the Financial Stability Board continue to work to accomplish such an objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.74,0)">Market regulation on, for example, over-the-counter instruments, alternative investment vehicles and ratings agencies is also an issue in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">On the economic side, at the European level, the key challenge is to bring the ‘economic’ part of E-M-U up to speed with the ‘monetary’ part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.17,0)">The crisis has shown that the overall system of economic governance was in need of fundamental reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.63,0)">Pro-cyclicality was not confined to monetary policy before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.86,0)">Actually, too many economies in the euro area entered the acute phase of the financial crisis with insufficient room for manoeuvre, because they had not behaved counter-cyclically before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.0,0)">Policy hyper-activism was another feature of fiscal policy management before the crisis, and the crisis exposed it in a spectacular way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">European leaders have responded by taking a number of important steps to remedy the situation, including measures to improve economic policy coordination in budgetary decisions, such as the so-called ‘European Semester’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">A new macroeconomic surveillance framework will be established in order to check deviant behaviour at an early stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The Stability and Growth Pact   will also be reformed to enhance the surveillance of fiscal policies and apply enforcement measures at an early stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">In addition to these EU-wide proposals at the legislative level, a separate pact   has been drawn up by the euro area countries and several other EU Member States in order to redress competitiveness differences, thereby further strengthening the economic pillar of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">These measures, once fully operational, would certainly improve the economic governance of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">But strict implementation is key, so that the concept of ‘effective peer review’ in the Union regains credibility among market participants and the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.44,0)">The ECB regards the reforms made to the macroeconomic and budgetary surveillance framework as not ambitious enough: they appear to leave room for discretion by Member States to escape sanctions in the event of non-compliance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">More automaticity in this regard would be preferable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.84,0)">Conclusion In conclusion, I believe that the crisis has exposed a couple of shortcomings in the monetary policy paradigm: policy frameworks are insufficiently medium term-oriented, and the role of monetary variables in this context is underappreciated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">But the core elements of the paradigm, including central bank independence and policies decisively oriented towards the maintenance of price stability, remain pertinent for the period ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Central banks have taken unprecedented steps to safeguard this overriding objective during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Looking ahead, it is up to other key stakeholders in the global financial and economic system to live up to their collective responsibilities and mandates in order to avoid any repetition of past mistakes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">How the World Achieved
