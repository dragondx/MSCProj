    <h2> Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Bankwirtschaftliche Tagung of the BVR, Berlin, 31 May 2017 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.73,0)"> 3-6-3: Banks and change Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Bankwirtschaftliche Tagung of the BVR, Berlin, 31 May 2017 Ladies and gentlemen, Once upon a time, there were bankers whose lives were marked by three numbers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.93,0)">Do you know those numbers?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.93,0)">They were 3, 6 and Bankers paid 3% interest on deposits, earned 6% on loans, and at 3 in the afternoon they drove to the golf course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.99,0)">Some of you might have fond memories of that life, while to others it might seem like a fairy tale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.3,0)">It was indeed a peaceful life – maybe even a bit boring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.11,0)">Today is different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.77,0)">Other numbers shape the life of bankers – zero might be one of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.59,0)">It’s not an easy life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.18,0)">And there is some anger about this – particularly in Germany, much less so in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.06,0)">Here, many people point at the ECB and its monetary policy, at regulators and their reforms and at supervisors and their high standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.63,0)">I understand why many bankers are grumbling; if I were you, I would probably be grumbling too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">But would it help, apart from making me feel a bit better?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Would it help my business or my bank?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.27,0)">I don’t think so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.74,0)">As they say: criticising others never saves you from having to work yourself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In my view, good business men and women are level-headed folks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">They are realists; they accept change; and they try to make the best out of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">And there are good business people in the family of cooperative banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">I see that many of them are adapting to a changing world, and I hope that this isn’t meeting too much resistance within the organisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">For in the end it’s the task of every bank to adapt its business model to the new macroeconomic environment and to the changing behaviour of customers – in short, banks have to face up to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.17,0)">But where does change actually come from?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.9,0)">Change and its causes It is almost a cliché that change drives economic progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.35,0)">New technologies are invented, people’s needs change, and the market reacts: new products are created, new competitors appear, and others disappear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.87,0)">This kind of change takes place all the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And it is happening right now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Digitalisation is a good example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Here we have a new technology that has permeated our lives – from cradle to grave, almost everything happens online.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">So why not banking as well?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">That, at least, is the question customers ask, and the banks should quickly answer them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.02,0)">If they don’t, they run the risk that others might be faster.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These “others” are, of course, the fintechs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">More and more of these young companies are entering the market and increasing the pressure on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.13,0)">And the pressure was already high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.31,0)">Even before the fintechs arrived, there were many banks on the market, ultimately too many.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Only those banks will survive that offer what customers want – and, among other things, that is digital banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Here, a profound change is under way – there is no doubt about that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Still, it is a kind of change that I regard as a normal part of business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But then there is another kind of change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.77,0)">This kind comes suddenly and unexpectedly, often triggered by a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.8,0)">And it can have dramatic effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.75,0)">Just think of the financial crisis and all of its consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let us take a closer look at two of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For a start, there was the decision to overhaul the rulebook for banks – a process which began almost ten years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.76,0)">I admit that such a thorough reform may create uncertainty – particularly if it goes on for so long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It’s high time that the reform was finalised and implemented; then we should close the “revising the rulebook” chapter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.29,0)">But the result is already clear: stricter rules for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.23,0)">The banks are not necessarily enthusiastic about that – they see, above all, that stricter rules mean higher costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I cannot deny that that is the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">But I also see that stricter rules make banks more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">There will be fewer crises and that will save a lot of money – including for the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">So yes, by and large the reforms are the right thing to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But the euro area is diverse, and so are the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">No two banks are alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There are large banks and small ones; there are international banks and regional ones; there are banks that bear high risks and banks that don’t.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.25,0)">Do we need the same rules for each bank?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.27,0)">I don’t think so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The rules should be determined by how risky a bank is and by its relevance for the entire system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">And that brings us to proportionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.55,0)">Smaller banks per se are a smaller risk for the system: if a small bank fails, it does not trigger a global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.95,0)">It would be a different story, of course, if many small banks were to get into difficulty at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.61,0)">Still, the rules for small banks don’t have to be as strict as those for large banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.82,0)">The same is true for supervision: small banks don’t have to be supervised as intensively as large ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We need to take a proportionate approach, and that’s what we do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.22,0)">Take reporting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Small banks that report according to national standards have it easier than large banks that report according to international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">They not only had more time to implement the ECB’s new requirements – two and a half years more, to be precise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.61,0)">Also, and above all, they have to report far fewer data points to the supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.57,0)">The smallest banks have to report just 600 data points to the supervisors; the largest banks have to report up to 40,000 data points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In future, smaller banks might have an even lighter load to bear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The European Commission is currently revising the European rulebook and is proposing even more proportionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.75,0)">That would not only affect reporting but other things as well, such as disclosure requirements or the rules on remuneration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Also under discussion is a reduction in capital requirements that would mainly benefit smaller and medium-sized banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Relevant proposals aim at maintaining the “SME supporting factor” and extending its scope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">So, things are indeed easier for small banks when it comes to rules and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.33,0)">Still, they don’t seem to see it like that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.63,0)">Why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.51,0)">There are two explanations I can think of.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">First of all, it might be that smaller banks apply a different benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.65,0)">Do they really compare their situation with that of larger banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.32,0)">Or do they perhaps compare their present situation with the past?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.34,0)">If that’s the benchmark, proportionality would mean unwinding the reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.46,0)">But that’s not the point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.98,0)">The rules have become stricter for everyone – for large and small banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.75,0)">And that was done on purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Proportionality means that the strictness has increased less for small banks than for the large ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.06,0)">And there could be a second reason for the feeling of a lack of proportionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.55,0)">The instances of relief for smaller banks are scattered across the rulebook and thus are not particularly visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.87,0)">And in supervision too, they often go unnoticed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">There are up to four on-site inspections per year for large banks; for smaller banks there is one on-site inspection every ten years – provided they are well managed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">So, there are instances of relief for smaller banks both in the rules and in supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.52,0)">But they are not very visible; the scale of proportionality appears smaller than it is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It might therefore make sense to bundle all these “lighter burdens” and put them in a separate box.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That box could then be labelled “small banking box” – a dedicated rulebook for small banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I am open-minded about the idea of a small banking box, but I think that it will be difficult to clearly define it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.9,0)">Which bank belongs in the box and which doesn’t?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.74,0)">This question has to be answered carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.52,0)">Regulatory reform was one consequence of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.66,0)">A second consequence concerns monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.67,0)">As inflation in the euro area is very low, monetary policy is very loose: for more than one year now, the key interest rate in the euro area has been at zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.05,0)">This is a massive change for banks as very many of them depend on interest income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.15,0)">And many are complaining about this, especially in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.09,0)">These days, monetary policy is often discussed very emotionally, and that makes it difficult to objectively weigh up the arguments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.36,0)">You all know that it is not the intention of the ECB to harm banks – or savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">By law, the ECB has a single objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">That objective is price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.58,0)">And it is a clear one: over the medium term, inflation should be close to, but below, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">For a long time, we have been a long way from this mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">That’s exactly why a loose monetary policy is appropriate, even though I am critical of one measure or another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Now many will of course say: but we are almost at 2%!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.22,0)">Indeed, inflation was still at 1.9% in April – very near to the objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.98,0)">But we should not just look at a single month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">We have to ensure price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.51,0)">Otherwise, in a worst-case scenario, we might have to adjust monetary policy every six weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">That would only increase the costs of monetary policy without bringing any benefit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.78,0)">The crucial question is: are we seeing a stable trend towards the 2% mark or just a temporary high?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Will the trend continue in the coming months?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We are not immediately expecting it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The fact that inflation rose in April was mainly due to oil prices and special effects such as the Easter holidays.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.81,0)">And, as expected, inflation in May has fallen again, to 1.4% At the same time, domestic price pressures are still subdued; the same is true for wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.19,0)">And there is something else: current inflation still contains an element of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.48,0)">Does that mean that we will have to maintain the loose monetary policy for a long time?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">No, there is certainly reason to be positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The euro area economy is definitely improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The recovery continues to firm and broaden, while the risks to growth, in my view, are now balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Business and consumer sentiment is positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.46,0)">And worries about deflation have disappeared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">All ingredients for an appropriate increase in prices are present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Against that backdrop, we should prepare to slowly reduce the dose of monetary medicine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">First, because the better the patient’s condition, the more he will feel the side effects of the medicine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">And here let’s face it: the current monetary policy is a strong medicine with strong side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.19,0)">That forces us to weigh things up continually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.14,0)">At some point, the costs of monetary policy will become greater than its benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">When that happens, we have to stop administering the medicine – and we should not be too hesitant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Second, the return to “normal” monetary policy will not be straightforward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">After all, we are administering a complex cocktail of various medicines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Adjusting the monetary policy measures has to be well planned and well communicated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.88,0)">The markets have to understand what monetary policy is doing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For precisely that reason we introduced forward guidance in 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Forward guidance should clearly signal to the market the future path of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The current situation always forms the basis for forward guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">So when the situation changes in a clear and not just temporary way, then forward guidance should also change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">To sum up: we will closely monitor how the patient’s condition is evolving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In doing so, we will consider both the effects and side effects of the medicine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">And when the time comes, we have to find the courage to withdraw the medicine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.01,0)">Hesitating for too long only creates new problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.6,0)">For the moment however there is one thing we can clearly state: banks have to deal with both kinds of change: the ordinary and the extraordinary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">They have to find their way in a digital world; they have to adhere to stricter rules and make the best out of very low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.91,0)">I understand why some banks feel overwhelmed by this – particularly the small ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.17,0)">And indeed, change leaves its marks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Change and its consequences More than anywhere else, we find these marks on the bottom line, in the profits, that is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.36,0)">No one will be surprised when I say that banks in the euro area have a profits problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.51,0)">Profits are too low; costs are too high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And that is true for both large banks and smaller ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.83,0)">And it’s no surprise either that smaller banks are having to struggle as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.1,0)">They often depend on interest income even more than large banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">That also applies to Germany’s cooperative banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Although their net income rose last year, it often comes from sources other than the traditional banking business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.27,0)">When compared with 2015, the interest income fell by 3.5% in 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.01,0)">The income came mainly from extraordinary revenues and they cannot be constantly repeated, as we all know.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.09,0)">One and a half years ago, an analysis done by the Bundesbank showed that the profits of the smaller German banks could fall by 25% by 2019 – in a worst-case scenario they could even fall by up to 75%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This analysis is currently being updated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And the ECB too will be taking a very close look at the smaller German banks this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">And yet, the smaller German banks are faring quite well in comparison, not least because of their hidden reserves and excess capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Both can help them to absorb losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.63,0)">But it’s obvious that someday the reserves will be depleted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Dealing with change How can banks keep pace with all the change?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Because in my view, they have to keep pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.88,0)">Those who lean back and wait for a miracle will fall backwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">And it is possible to be profitable – even in these difficult times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">We see about two dozen larger banks in the euro area that are faring very well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Their return on equity consistently lies above the average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">And that is not because these banks have less equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It is because they generate more revenue – their interest income is above average, but other revenue sources play a role as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">So there is hope – but it does not come for free.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.64,0)">Each bank has to act and adjust its business model if it doesn’t want to be left behind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">That means starting with the new digital demands of customers which I mentioned before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">The cooperative banks incidentally are doing very well in this regard: “omnichannel banking” and “scan to bank” are two keywords that come to mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">DZ Bank and the entire association have jointly taken up the challenge of digitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">They are creating structures that help them to move into digital banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">And here a tight network offers advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Every single cooperative bank is close to its customers and knows their wishes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">In this way, it can develop new ideas and share them with all the other banks in the group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Handled like this, digitalisation can help to open up new distribution channels, create new products and win over new customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In view of the low interest rates, it makes sense for banks to tap other sources of revenue, such as commission income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.81,0)">But revenues are just one side of the equation, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.9,0)">The other side shows the costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.86,0)">I already mentioned that German banks have very high costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">So on this side of the equation, too, there is room to adapt – “saving sensibly” should be the slogan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">And again, I can praise you, ladies and gentlemen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The association of cooperative banks is doing just that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The first example that occurs to me is the merger of the IT providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">It will help to reduce costs for every single cooperative bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">That requires, however, all banks to migrate to the new system; and that takes time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">And here we see that a true association offers all sorts of advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">On the one hand, it is decentralised: every member is very small and thus poses only a small risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">On the other hand, the association offers many ways to achieve economies of scale and thus reduce costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The association and the
