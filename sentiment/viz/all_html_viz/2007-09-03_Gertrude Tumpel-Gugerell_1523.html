    <span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)"> SEPA – from steam train to TGV?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBOff-site meeting of the European Payments CouncilBrugge/Bruges, 3 September 2007 Introduction Thank you very much for inviting me to present the ECB’s view of the Single Euro Payments Area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">And thank you as well for organising this meeting in Bruges, which is considered the most beautiful town in Belgium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The EPC is quite talented when it comes to selecting locations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.66,0)">First Durbuy, the smallest town in Belgium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.81,0)">And one of the most difficult towns to reach, whether by car or public transport.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And now Bruges, the most beautiful town, where even the TGV stops!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It makes me wonder where the next off-site meeting will be… But seriously, if you study the history of Bruges, you’ll see that it has had several periods when its economy grew and its culture thrived.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">As an old Hanseatic town, it had strong trade links with England and other parts of northern Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">High-quality Flemish cloth was the main product in the 13th century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Bruges blossomed as an international centre of trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Banking and trade finance services developed around the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.16,0)">However, Bruges has also seen periods of sharp decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.0,0)">Direct access to the North Sea has always been a problem, both for geological and political reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">This led to increasing competition from other Flemish cities, such as Antwerp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.69,0)">When the cloth trade completely collapsed in the 15th century, Bruges was left without real alternatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">It did recover temporarily in the 17th century by producing lace, a very labour-intensive process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Lace production brought jobs, prosperity and culture back to the city.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.23,0)">As many as 6,000 women out of a total of 40,000 inhabitants were producing lace at the turn of the 19th century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Looking around this room, I have to conclude that the participation rate of women in that industry was significantly higher than in the payments industry of today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.97,0)">The industrial revolution, however, rendered the lace industry obsolete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.74,0)">Bruges was unable to adapt and became ‘Bruges-la-Morte’, a town in decline, the poorest one in Flanders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.66,0)">The fact that the city was “depressed”, as documented in the famous novel   by Georges Rodenbach, at a time when modernisation was changing the face of many urban areas, meant that the historical centre of the city remained largely intact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Moreover, King Leopold the Second   wanted the town to preserve and restore its architectural treasures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">As a result, the town has, over the years, become an important tourist destination, building on one of its strengths and seizing new opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The European integration process provided another opportunity, and since 1949 Bruges is host to the College of Europe, a university that focuses on postgraduate European studies in the legal, economic and political disciplines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">What can we learn from the history of Bruges?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.37,0)">Over-reliance on traditional products  , not adapting to customer demands and not anticipating change   do not make for a good strategy for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Building on strengths and seizing new opportunities is!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In my speech tonight, I will convey the views of the Eurosystem on the current phase of the SEPA project, aimed at transforming SEPA from a concept into a reality; outline the next steps for SEPA which should be taken to make it more attractive to customers; describe the changed environment in which banks have to operate, and present my views on the future role of the European Payments Council  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">My main message to you will be that the EPC and the individual banks should move ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.35,0)">Those who don’t will run the risk of being quickly overtaken by the new reality, just like the cloth traders and lace producers of Bruges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Making SEPA a reality: only four months to go The Eurosystem supports the creation of the Single Euro Payments Area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">SEPA will make it possible for retail payments in euro to be made throughout the euro area under the same basic conditions, and from a single account, regardless of location.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">These changes are needed to move towards a more integrated payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">It will bring substantial economic benefits for society as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In this respect, I should say that the Eurosystem greatly appreciates the work already done by the European banks and especially by the EPC.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">When addressing this EPC meeting last year, I concluded that impressive progress had been made, but that some issues of concern remained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The work on SEPA for Cards was not advancing as quickly as we had expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">And in the field of e- and m-payments the EPC was encouraged to step up its activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.48,0)">Now, a year later, I think it is fair to say that the EPC has been focusing on short-term implementation issues, and has not been able to tackle the more fundamental and strategic issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.2,0)">From a project management perspective, this is understandable, as the deadline of January 2008 is approaching rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.58,0)">However, the EPC has even taken a step backwards with its decision not to continue with the DMF-model in SEPA Direct Debits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.44,0)">Work on e- and m-payments has hardly progressed and SEPA for Cards remains underdeveloped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">For me, this is a sign that the EPC should re-evaluate its goals and possibly its working procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.81,0)">I will return to this issue later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.25,0)">In the short term, efforts need to be stepped up to overcome short-term problems that could hamper the timely launch of SEPA next January.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Not only do the EPC and the individual banks have to take action, but also all the other stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In particular, public administrations, corporates and merchants should become more active.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me briefly run through the Eurosystem’s key recommendations for the SEPA project, which are described in the recently published Fifth Progress Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To prepare for a take-up of the SEPA Direct Debit, the EPC needs to clarify by December 2007 the exact features of all elements that will be offered in addition to the core SEPA direct debits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">As a minimum, the e-mandate with debtor bank validation has to be developed – and a business-to-business scheme also should be developed that is capable of attracting wide acceptance by corporate users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The successful launch of SEPA requires the major payment banks to be able to send and receive SEPA credit transfers as from January 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">In order to offer broad reachability for its clients, each bank should now make appropriate arrangements with one or more banks, or with clearing and settlement mechanisms  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Infrastructures will play an important role in creating reachability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.13,0)">It is unrealistic and even undesirable that a single CSM will have all banks in Europe as participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">The Eurosystem therefore welcomes the work of EACHA in designing the interface specifications and business procedures to establish links between Automated Clearing Houses  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">All ACHs are invited to join this work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I have been told that the first links are being built, based on these EACHA interface specifications and business procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The Eurosystem sees a genuine need for at least one additional European debit card scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">It would stimulate competition and would ensure the strategic involvement of European banks in the cards business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The separation of scheme management and processing, an objective the Eurosystem very much shares with the EPC, as well as the development of SEPA cards standards, will make it easier to create and implement new schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Clear signals from banks, schemes and other market players that they are working on the setting-up of such a scheme would be seen as good news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The EPC should also reconsider the option of developing a debit card scheme itself, as it has done for the SEPA Credit Transfer Scheme and the SEPA Direct Debit Scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">With the SEPA cards standards being defined by the end of 2008 at the latest, and the SEPA Cards Framework already in place, this seems to be a logical next step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Finally, more communication on SEPA is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The key target groups at this stage are, on the one hand, corporates and public administrations in their function as large users of payment services and, on the other hand, the associations of small and medium-sized enterprises   and consumers as the representatives of smaller users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">The ECB and the National Central Banks are ready to support a special communication effort at the start of SEPA in January 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Apart from these short-term recommendations, the Eurosystem urges the EPC to continue its work and take responsibility for broadening and deepening of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Next steps: making SEPA more attractive The SEPA project has until now been very much aimed at laying the groundwork for the core SEPA payment products and at setting the basic requirements for infrastructures and card schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Banks are implementing the changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Real products are being developed based on the rulebooks and their implementation guidelines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, just offering the new SEPA products will not automatically set in motion the migration from domestic products to SEPA payment products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Banks have to offer customer-friendly services aimed at facilitating the migration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Moreover, the core and basic products will not necessarily deliver enough extra value to the customer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The exception is SEPA Direct Debit, which opens up the possibility of using a direct debit across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Banks need to move forward and develop future-oriented products that meet customer demands and needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Facilitating migration through customer-friendly services As their top priority, banks need to develop services that will help their customers to migrate to the new SEPA products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I am aware that banks have primary responsibility for these services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">However, the EPC can contribute to the availability and quality of these services by taking some preparatory action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.3,0)">Corporate customers will not start to use SEPA Credit Transfer and SEPA Direct Debit if they cannot update their bank account databases automatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.68,0)">It would cost each corporate tens of euro per customer to manually change the BBAN bank account details into an IBAN/BIC supplied by the customer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">An IBAN/BIC update service for corporates is urgently needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">The Eurosystem urges the EPC to act as a coordinator, ensuring that the responsible entities deliver the necessary bank account information and enabling either banks or vendors to provide corporates with this update service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">In addition, ways should be found to help creditors to use the existing mandates for the new SEPA Direct Debits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The EPC and the national banking communities should tackle this issue, in coordination with the national central banks and legislators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">In some countries, Additional Optional Services   will most probably be needed to bring the SEPA payment products up to the same service level as the current domestic products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, these AOS are not to be implemented with an implicit objective to protect domestic markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Full transparency on community-wide AOS is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Developing future-oriented products and services Second, banks should develop future-oriented products and services, as the basic and core payment products no longer necessarily meet the changed customer demands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">One of these customer demands is the possibility of reducing the costs of making and collecting payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Using e-invoices and limiting the number of paper invoices being sent by normal mail would save corporates and SMEs a lot of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.22,0)">When the e-invoicing is coupled with a direct debit or with Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment  , it reduces not only paperwork on the debtor’s side but also mistakes in filling out the payment order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Of course, these opportunities are largely independent of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">But SEPA does offer a better starting point and SEPA payment products even provide the basic foundation for these services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">For corporates, huge efficiency gains can also be made when the payments which they send and receive can be linked automatically and seamlessly to their businesses processes, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">to the value chain within their company.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">This has been a long-standing demand from corporate customers, one to which banks should respond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">As such, SEPA should address standardisation in the customer-to-bank field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">A third domain of future-oriented products and services is e-commerce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.66,0)">With e-commerce still growing, most banks seem to have missed out on opportunities to offer value-added services to their web-merchant clients as well as secure payments to their private and corporate clients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.41,0)">PayPal, now part of eBAY, is often mentioned as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It offers its service to over 100,000 websites in Europe and has 35 million European customer accounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Total payment volume was almost 12 billion US dollars globally in the second quarter of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">It was up 32% from the previous year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Per quarter, over two billion dollars are processed in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Global net revenues were almost half a billion dollars  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The EPC and the individual banks should give more attention to e-payments, e-invoicing, customer-to-bank standardisation and other products and services that would really broaden and deepen the SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">SEPA in a changed economic and market environment While making SEPA a reality and making it more attractive, banks have to prepare for upcoming changes in the economic and business environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The Eurosystem is convinced that the SEPA project will bring economic benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Customers will profit from better services and better prices, due to increased competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">But even for the banks, SEPA can have a positive business impact in the longer term, due to improved cost efficiency and economies of scale and scope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Our research shows that the balance between the costs of implementing SEPA and the revenues from SEPA is closely related to the length of the period of dual processing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.63,0)">To avoid the unnecessary costs of a lengthy period of dual processing, the end date for the use of national payment instruments should be specified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Moreover, this ‘sunset’ date for the national payment instruments should be at the start of the decade, to enable SEPA to get up to speed and prevent it from losing momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Broader economic developments are however making themselves felt in the banking industry, and these in turn will influence the commercial success of banks in SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">It is clear that multi-country European banks are preparing to make the most of the opportunities that SEPA offers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Especially those banks that have their IT systems in good shape should be able to adapt to the new SEPA environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Economies of scale can be reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">A telling sign is also the increasing number of banking mergers and takeovers in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">SEPA is not only an issue and an opportunity for large, pan-European banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Small, regional banks will also have customers demanding better services and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The SEPA payment schemes will give such banks a chance to offer a full set of payment services even more easily than today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Increased competition among infrastructure providers in SEPA should deliver new and interesting processing solutions to precisely these medium and smaller-sized banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">A fact of life for all banks, great and small, is that the European playing field set by SEPA and the PSD makes it easier for non-banks and international banks to enter formerly protected domestic markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Of course, they would aim at the most lucrative and accessible market segments, such as internet savings accounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.4,0)">Losing the revenues of dormant saving accounts will force many banks to change their business model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Another stable source of revenue whose prospects have become less certain is the interchange fees for card payments and direct debits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">You are all very aware of the interest the competition authorities have shown in the business models for these payment products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We are all awaiting the upcoming decisions of the European competition authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.19,0)">A further challenge to the banking sector, and one to which the banking sector has to adapt, is the growing and increasingly well-organised pressure from clients aimed at avoiding price increases or even forcing price decreases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In general, SEPA should bring increased cost efficiencies and better prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Even if some prices do rise, this should only happen if service levels are improved at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">When talking about future-oriented payment services, changing business models and pressures on revenues, we should also bear cash payments in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.54,0)">Banks often describe their cash services as ‘bleeders’ in their payments portfolio, meaning a product with very high costs and low revenues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The Eurosystem is taking steps to converge the cash services of the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Moreover, the Eurosystem encourages the banks’ measures to promote the use of the most social cost-efficient means of payment in every payment situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">SEPA for Cards represents a huge opportunity here, and banks should really try to make cards more attractive to cardholders and merchants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">New roles for the EPC: a single market needs good governance Apart from preparing for SEPA, banks have to realise that the old ways of doing business have long gone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Banks need to take into account the latest ways of organising their payments businesses, which includes involving other stakeholders in the governance of products, as well as in the development of new products and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Banks should invest time and effort in dialogues with their stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Stakeholders should be informed in timely and comprehensible ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">And they should be offered the chance to provide input, also on payments issues not directly related to the existing SEPA Payment Schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The EPC should organise this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The EPC itself should organise stakeholder dialogue at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Due to the size of the SEPA area, extra care should be taken to ensure the different opinions are effectively heard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Although banks are faced with many challenges, they are in a good starting position because of their central role in the payments business and the client relationships they have built up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Banks should use these strengths to seize the opportunities that SEPA is offering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In essence, banks have to choose between the risk of becoming ‘Bruges-la-Morte’ or the investment costs of building a flourishing business in SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.37,0)">I mentioned earlier that progress within the EPC has been rather limited in respect of cards and state-of-the-art payment products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.86,0)">It seems that the EPC has difficulty progressing beyond the lowest common denominator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">However, more than the minimum will be needed to make SEPA a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Now that most of the design work on the basic and core products has been done, the EPC Plenary should be able to make a greater contribution to the discussion of the more challenging issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">The Governing Council is clear in its Fifth Progress Report on SEPA: there is a continuing need to deepen and broaden the SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">And the EPC is expected to play its role in this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The EPC is already the market-driven decision-making body for the European payments industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">It has shown strong leadership and it has built up a good reputation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Every payment service provider is duly represented in the EPC Plenary, and this should continue to be the case after the introduction of payment institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">More attention should however be given to the deepening and broadening of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">In addition, the EPC should organise the stakeholder dialogue at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">And finally, it should evolve into a European platform able to analyse, discuss and confront the changing reality of the payments landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Conclusion In my speech tonight, I have conveyed the views of the Eurosystem on the current phase of the SEPA project, aimed at transforming SEPA from a concept into a reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">In the short term, efforts need to be stepped up to overcome problems that could hamper the timely launch of SEPA in January 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Specific attention should be paid to SEPA Direct Debit and to the finalisation of all its features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">An additional European debit card scheme is genuinely needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In parallel, preparations should get under way to make SEPA more attractive to customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Merely offering the new SEPA products will not trigger the migration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Banks have to offer customer-friendly services to achieve this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Moreover, the core and basic products will not necessarily deliver extra value to the customer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Banks need to make progress and develop future-oriented products that meet customer demands and needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Future-oriented products can be built on the
