    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.71,0)"> Walled off?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Banking regulation after the crisis Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Institute of International and European Affairs, Dublin, 13 March 2017 Walls have their place in human history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.73,0)">Just think of the Great Wall of China or Hadrian’s Wall or the Berlin Wall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.45,0)">And then there are the more abstract walls: paywalls or Chinese walls, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.83,0)">In my speech today, I would like to discuss banking regulation – which some see as a massive wall of rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.71,0)">If you asked bankers, some would certainly claim that they have been imprisoned by that wall and would even like to tear it down – some politicians might feel the same way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.65,0)">However, to paraphrase the American poet Robert Frost: “Don’t ever take a wall down until you know why it was put up”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">You will understand that I, as a German, cannot fully support this statement but with regard to regulation this advice is appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Following that advice, let us have a look at why the regulatory wall was put up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.78,0)">Why banks need rules Why do we need rules at all?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.63,0)">Rules confine us; they limit our freedom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Take the rules of the road as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.15,0)">You can’t drive as fast as you want; you have to wear a seat belt and you have to stop at red lights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">These rules exist to make our lives safer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">They help to prevent accidents; they protect drivers, passengers and pedestrians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.11,0)">And that also applies to banking rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.83,0)">Banks take on risks – that is part of their job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.62,0)">These risks, however, can lead to huge losses – not only for the banks and their investors, but for the entire economy and all of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.39,0)">In the euro area, it is mostly banks that finance the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">They also take in deposits and provide other essential services, in payments, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">It is therefore crucial that banks work well – not only in the short run but in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">So it makes sense not to give them absolute freedom, but to wall them off from the biggest risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.63,0)">After all, bankers are people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.94,0)">Like the rest of us, they sometimes tend to overestimate potential profits and underestimate risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.19,0)">Markets can get carried away, as Alan Greenspan said, by irrational exuberance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Expecting eternal growth, banks might make huge investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.08,0)">But at some point reality hits, and it might hit hard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.19,0)">If it does, those who took on too much risk might fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.42,0)">And the crisis taught us that the failure of a single bank can damage the entire financial system and the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.92,0)">In a nutshell, that’s why banks need rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">That’s why the regulatory wall was put up in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">And following the financial crisis, we have repaired and modified it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Not all banks, of course, are happy with the new wall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.49,0)">While they seem to agree with regulation in principle, they usually think it is too strict.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.73,0)">They say that the sheer number and complexity of the new rules increase the costs of doing business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.86,0)">They also say that this limits their ability to finance the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.13,0)">In short, the banks claim that regulation hurts them, the economy and, thus, all of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Unsurprisingly, I disagree.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.35,0)">It is true, of course, that there are many rules; and it is true that the rulebook is very complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.64,0)">But then again, banking has become very complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Over the past decades, banks have come up with ever more sophisticated innovations – all of them have added to the complexity of banking but not always to its value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.81,0)">The rules just mirror this complexity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me give you an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Banks favour what is known as “internal models”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Using these models, they calculate how risky their assets are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The risk-weighted assets then form the basis for calculating capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">So banks are clearly in favour of risk sensitivity when it comes to determining the adequate level of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">And I too see merits in that approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.38,0)">But internal models are complex, and to keep them in check, we need complex rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.26,0)">These rules, for instance, require banks to comply with certain conditions before they are allowed to use their models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.13,0)">Without these rules we would quickly experience a race to the bottom in capital and an uneven playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.07,0)">It is true that rules impose a burden on those who have to comply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">And the pressure on banks has increased quite a lot since the crisis; I won’t deny that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Still, there are two points I would like to make.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">First, we seek to ensure that the burden is reasonable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.83,0)">Take reporting, which banks often describe as a major burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">However, to do our job, we need data from banks – not just on internal models but on all sorts of things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">And this data needs to be comparable across the euro area; we must be able to compare banks with their peers, be they Irish, French, German, whatever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We therefore need a European approach to reporting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In this regard, it would lighten the load on banks if national regulators and supervisors were to adjust their own reporting requirements and processes to the new European reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.0,0)">My second point is that rules may not only put a burden on banks but also offer them benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Strong rules foster trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.69,0)">Would you get into a taxi if you knew the driver was not bound by traffic rules?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.63,0)">Would you do business with a bank that was not regulated?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.25,0)">Banks with a low level of capital and inadequate internal controls are viewed with suspicion: investors ask for higher risk premia and the banks thus face higher funding costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.2,0)">Banks need people’s trust to do business, but as a result of the crisis they have lost a lot of trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.9,0)">They should bear this in mind when complaining about regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.09,0)">Now, do bank rules harm the economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.36,0)">This question mainly, but not only, focuses on capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.63,0)">Usually, the argument goes like this: capital is expensive for banks and might prompt them to increase lending rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.12,0)">And even worse, it might cause them to stop lending altogether for fear of not meeting their capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.62,0)">That in turn would choke credit growth and damage the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But consider the benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Banks which are well capitalised are well prepared to withstand shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It is these banks that keep credit flowing to the economy even when the going gets tough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">These banks can finance the economy throughout the entire business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.19,0)">Banks with low levels of capital, on the other hand, are more likely to face a crisis, and banking crises are costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.13,0)">They inflict damage on the economy by hurting growth, destroying jobs and putting a burden on taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.87,0)">As a matter of fact, recessions that accompany a banking crisis are much more severe than “normal” recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.89,0)">So, strong rules put a burden on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">But at the same time, they do help the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Only well-capitalised, well-managed banks do a good job of lending to the real economy over the short, medium and long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The net benefit should be positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Empirical studies indicate that the benefits of higher capital are indeed greater than the costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">To me, higher capital and strong rules in general seem to be a small price to pay for a more stable and prosperous economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">And the banks themselves also benefit from more stability, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Against that backdrop, I favour a strong regulatory wall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">But, work on that wall seems to follow a pattern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.31,0)">After a crisis, the wall is usually reinforced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.68,0)">Then, after some time, as the crisis fades into the background and tends to be forgotten, someone starts chipping away at it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.13,0)">The risks start penetrating the cracks in the wall, eventually leading to a crisis, and the cycle begins again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.83,0)">I’m afraid that a change of direction lies just ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">There are more and more voices calling for an easing of the rules – not just banks, of course, but also some politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">My advice to them is: don’t weaken regulation just for a short-lived increase in growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Instead, we should finalise the reforms as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">We have been repairing and modifying the regulatory wall for eight years now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.01,0)">It’s been a long time, and I understand that the reforms have created uncertainty for the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It’s time to finish the job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It’s time to finish the job and to focus on implementing the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.28,0)">Writing the rules However, the job can only be finished at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We must not build walls that separate nations; we must build a global regulatory wall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The financial system knows no national borders, and regulation must be equally global.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.98,0)">It is the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision that is in charge here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Founded more than 40 years ago, it has become the main forum for discussing and drafting global rules for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The Basel Committee comprises central bankers and supervisors from 28 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Since the crisis, it has devised an improved set of global rules, known as Basel III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">While much of Basel III has already been agreed upon, some final issues remain open.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.24,0)">These are still being debated by the Basel Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.04,0)">In my view, it is time to conclude that debate and bring the reforms to an end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.3,0)">With regard to the reforms, I sometimes hear people complain that the Basel Committee lacks democratic legitimacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.01,0)">They say it’s an opaque body that imposes its rules on banks all over the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.66,0)">The answer, of course, is that the Basel Committee does not impose anything on anyone; it does not set binding laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It defines global standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.27,0)">These standards are mere proposals submitted to lawmakers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.87,0)">It is they who decide whether the proposals are to be transposed into actual laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.87,0)">In the EU, it is the European Commission that proposes such laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.41,0)">The European Parliament and the Council of the EU then decide on whether to pass the laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The key decisions are thus taken by elected national and EU representatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.66,0)">It is they who decide on European banking law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.62,0)">European law comes in two forms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">First, there are regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">These are directly applicable in all EU countries and provide a truly level playing field for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Second, there are directives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These still need to be transposed into national law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.4,0)">And this often leads to differences – the outcome in Ireland might be different from the outcome in Germany or Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is not a problem in itself as long as the differences are rooted in country-specific risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.2,0)">But there are still some unjustified differences; there are some uneven patches on the playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.06,0)">Such patches run counter to the idea of a European banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.47,0)">They prevent the European banking sector from growing together, and they make European banking supervision less efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">They require us to apply 19 different national rules instead of a single European one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.71,0)">That is bureaucratic, and it is expensive, first and foremost for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">If policymakers are serious about European financial integration, they must further harmonise the relevant rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.99,0)">And there is another source of fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.3,0)">EU banking law contains some provisions that are known as options and discretions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Some of them give supervisors leeway in applying the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">It was therefore one of our first major projects to tackle the issue of options and discretions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Together with the national supervisors, we have agreed to exercise them in a uniform way across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">We have made the playing field a bit more even.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But there are also options and discretion which fall within the competence of the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And here harmonisation based on the “same business, same risks, same rules” principle is paramount, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.83,0)">Rules carved in stone?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">To sum up: I am very much in favour of a strong regulatory wall, and I am convinced that it has to be global.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">I am also in favour of harmonised rules in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.84,0)">Still, rules must not be carved in stone, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Driven by innovation, the banking sector constantly evolves – new instruments are devised, new risks emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The rules must reflect such change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.82,0)">After all, the financial crisis was partly caused by financial innovations that took place outside the regulatory wall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">To be sure: eight years of regulatory reform have led to a comprehensive renovation of the regulatory wall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Now it may be time to check whether all the pieces, all the bricks, fit together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">And it may be time to make sure the new rules have no unintended consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.14,0)">But I don’t expect any major revisions, just some minor adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In any case, I welcome the fact that the European rules are now being reviewed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In November, the European Commission made proposals on how to adapt and amend the relevant laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">And there are a lot of good things in these proposals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">First, they support the idea of the global regulatory wall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">They seek to transpose a series of global standards into European law – the leverage ratio is one example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Second, they support the goal of creating a truly European banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">They allow for capital and liquidity waivers to be granted for intragroup exposures – not just within a single country as before, but on an EU cross-border basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">This would make life easier for banking groups that span the entire EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And third, they support the principle of proportionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">They seek to ease the regulatory burden on smaller banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">And that’s good: smaller banks generally represent a smaller risk and therefore do not need to be as strongly regulated as large banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But there are also items in the proposals that should be further discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">First, supervisors need to be able to act quickly and flexibly, based on their judgement and expertise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">A few proposals, however, seek to put a tighter frame around supervisory actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.56,0)">That would limit our ability to adapt our actions to the ever-changing financial industry – an industry that is always looking for the best deal, that is always testing the boundaries of regulation and that seizes any opportunity to arbitrage the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.05,0)">Second, in some cases, the proposals deviate from global standards – for instance, with regard to liquidity rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.18,0)">Sometimes, these deviations just reflect EU specificities and do not run counter to the goals of regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In other cases, we would need to ensure that the deviations do not increase risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">And third, I still hope for more harmonised rules – I have already touched upon that issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.05,0)">There are, for instance, still some unwarranted options and discretions that lie within the competence of Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">These uneven patches in the playing field should be repaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusion I have argued that banks need rules, and that these rules need to be global.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.7,0)">I have therefore warned against leaving the global regulatory wall unfinished or even tearing it down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It protects us all: taxpayers who had to bail out failing banks during the crisis; savers and investors who lost money; business owners who could not get loans; and, yes, it also protects the banks themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.46,0)">Still, the history of finance seems to follow an eternal cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.11,0)">A crisis happens and the rules are tightened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">After a while, people forget the crisis, and the rules are loosened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.88,0)">This leads to the next crisis, which takes everyone by surprise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The rules are tightened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Listening to some politicians, I am worried that we are about to enter the next stage of the cycle: a new wave of deregulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As George Bernard Shaw said: “If history repeats itself, and the unexpected always happens, how incapable must man be of learning from experience!”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Isn’t it time to prove that we are capable of learning from experience?</span>
