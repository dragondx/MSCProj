    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.59,0)"> EMU - how much federalism?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Keynote Address by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 5th Frankfurt Conference on Financial Market Policy, organised by the SAFE Policy Center of Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, 27 October 2017 Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the organisers Jan-Peter Krahnen and Hans-Helmut Kotz for inviting me to speak at the fifth edition of the Frankfurt Conference on Financial Market Policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The theme of the conference is well-chosen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.6,0)">Despite significant improvements to its architecture over recent years, there is a clear sense that Economic and Monetary Union, or EMU, remains incomplete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.42,0)">There is much less clarity and precious little agreement on what a complete EMU would look like, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This is why the question posed by the organisers – “how much federalism” – is so relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In my remarks, I would like to first review how federalism has evolved in the EU, highlighting that it is as much a process as it is an end-state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I will then – drawing on the economic concept of fiscal federalism – look more at the question of “how much federalism”, focusing on issue of risk-sharing and the role of different levels of governance within EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Federalism in the EU The nature of the discussion on federalism in Europe has changed quite dramatically over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Shortly after the Second World War, the ambition for some was to create a “United States of Europe”, mainly as a way to avoid renewed, devastating war.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This vision was shared by those who laid the foundations of the European Union in the 1950s, most notably Jean Monnet, the first President of the European Coal and Steel Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">From today’s perspective, it may seem surprising that the start of such a grand project was confined to an area as specific as coal and steel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">But Monnet and the other early architects of European integration clearly understood that political federalism was the end-point of long process, which had to be achieved incrementally and through focused actions in limited policy areas where the benefits of European cooperation could be clearly seen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">To quote one of Monnet’s contemporaries, Alcide de Gasperi,“we must begin by pooling only what is strictly essential to the achievement of our immediate aims, and do this by means of flexible formulae which can be gradually and progressively applied”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">For these “fathers of Europe”, however, it was self-evident that such incremental measures would gradually move Europe deeper into federalism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Indeed, this clear sense of direction was, in their way, a key motor to keep the integration process moving forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Since then, the European integration process has tended to move in waves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.93,0)">There have been times when it has stalled, such as the during the “empty chair crisis” in the 1960s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">And there have been times when it has unexpectedly sped ahead, such as with the launch of the Single Market Act in the 1980s, and the commitment to Economic and Monetary Union   in the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.53,0)">But today, there is some confusion as to where we stand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.44,0)">In some ways, the degree of ambition to achieve a full political federation seems to have become more limited, which has led some to wonder whether the integration process will lose its forward momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.34,0)">This reflects in part the failure of the Constitution for Europe in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.58,0)">The unsuccessful referendums in France and the Netherlands can be interpreted in different ways, but they clearly suggested that the people of the European Union were not ready to embark on the road towards full political federalism – or at least not at that point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">It is also fair to say that the appetite for such federalism today is not much different from in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.66,0)">In recent years there have been growing doubts about the European project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">At the same time, polls consistently show that European citizens support federal decision-making in a wide range of areas, ranging from energy to migration to the fight against terrorism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">This reflects the fact that the benefits of federalism are much broader than its economic, fiscal and monetary dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Indeed, since the EU was originally devised as a peace-keeping device, it is not surprising that one of the early initiatives for European integration was a motion to establish a European Defence Community, although this failed in 1954.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">While a full defence union is probably still unrealistic, there are increasing signs that further integration in this area could happen in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The Commission reflection paper published on 7 June of this year lays out proposals for establishing a European Defence Fund, which could form the nucleus of a future defence union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Last week, the European Council welcomed the significant progress made by Member States in preparing a Permanent Structured Cooperation   in the field of defence, and the work done on the Commission’s proposal for a European Defence Industrial Development Programme  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">All this clearly chimes with the preferences of European citizens, three-quarters of whom support “a common defence and security policy among EU Member States”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The conclusion that follows is that we have to distinguish federalism as a state from federalism as a process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It may be the case that a full political federation is not currently desired by European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But that does not mean that they reject the process of federalism – which is to say, the dynamic allocation and reallocation of responsibilities to different levels of government according to the preferences and needs of the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">While this process may benefit from the gravitational pull of a pre-defined end point, it can also advance without it, so long as actions are taken in areas where the benefits of cooperation are clear and the steps taken are legitimate in the eyes of citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Indeed, what gave the EU both momentum and popular legitimacy in the years after the war was its achievements – effective actions in specific areas – not necessarily the visions of a unified Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">So how much federalism would satisfy these requirements today?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">One way to assess this is through looking at the economic aspects of federalism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Certainly, as Richard and Peggy Musgrave wrote, “economic analysis does not tell us what degree of closeness the member units of a federation should feel toward each other”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Political aspects transcend economic ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">But economic analysis can help us better understand the consequences of various institutional arrangements and choose the instruments we should use to pursue our common objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the rest of my remarks I will zoom in on some of these aspects of federalism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Economic aspects of federalism An important theme – one aspect of which will be addressed in the first session today – is risk-sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.74,0)">The crisis has reminded us that both private and public risk-sharing are underdeveloped in Europe, and that this underdevelopment comes at huge cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">So, there is general agreement that risk-sharing channels need to be improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.73,0)">There is less agreement on where the emphasis should lie.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Some argue that the priority should be to strengthen private risk-sharing, by completing the banking union and establishing a truly integrated capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Others argue that EMU needs to focus on public risk-sharing, be it through introducing a central euro area fiscal capacity or creating safe assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In reality, separating these two channels of risk-sharing is far from the obvious solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.86,0)">Is private risk-sharing a substitute for public risk-sharing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Or do they complement each other?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">There are several arguments in support of the view that the two channels complement each other – but only if the right powers are matched at the federal level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.65,0)">For example, it is clear that the banking union would not fully achieve its goal of severing the toxic link between banks and national governments without a central fiscal backstop for the already-existing Single Resolution Fund, as well as for the European Deposit Insurance Scheme that is still under discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.95,0)">At the same time, fiscal backstops generally raise legitimate questions about incentive structures to protect taxpayers, which need to be addressed in parallel by appropriate fiscal governance at the federal level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The process of building the banking union also illustrates how important it is to reach an appropriate degree of federalism to achieve the objective of a stable and integrated financial system that supports the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Ideally, in a genuine banking union banks would operate in the Single Market just as they operate in their domestic market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">This is essential to reap the full benefits of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.74,0)">The country in which a bank is headquartered should be irrelevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">But, in practice, it remains relevant for as long as the consequences of potential bank failures are still predominantly national.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.49,0)">The irrelevance of a bank’s headquarters, therefore, depends on the institutional structure of the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Let me take one very specific example to illustrate my point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The banking union is not yet considered a single geographical area in the supervisory methodology applied to globally systematically important banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">These G-SIBs are subject to additional capital requirements, which are calibrated on the basis of a cross-jurisdictional indicator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.57,0)">This indicator reflects the fact that failures of global banks are more difficult to handle owing to coordination difficulties and cross-border spillover effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.14,0)">When the responsibility for banks is shared, additional capital buffers for cross-border activities lose their raison d’être.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.73,0)">A single set of harmonised prudential rules for all banks in the European Union would not, in and of itself, be sufficient for the EU to be considered as a single geographical area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">But the Single Rulebook, the existence of a single supervisor, the Single Supervisory Mechanism  , of a single resolution authority, the Single Resolution Mechanism  , and of a common backstop, the Single Resolution Fund  , when taken together, have equipped the banking union with all the features of a single geographical area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This should mean that the banking union is treated as a single geographical area in the supervisory methodology in future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Finally, there is the question of how to design fiscal risk-sharing mechanisms for EMU, while taking into account EMU’s unique nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.65,0)">In existing federations the stabilisation function of the central budget is usually a by-product of redistribution via large tax transfer systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">At this stage of European integration, it is clear that any politically acceptable euro area fiscal capacity will be modest in size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">So, the key question for the economics profession is whether it is possible to remove the link between the stabilisation function and the redistributive function, allowing for a central budget of moderate size to have a meaningful macroeconomic stabilisation effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">If this were possible, such a central budget could help monetary policy, especially in times of deep recessions when nominal interest rates may reach their effective lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The European Commission set out some proposals in its reflection paper published on 31 May – these require further study.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.65,0)">The answer to the question of today’s conference – “How much federalism?” – is not easy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Yet, speaking as an economist, I think it is likely that the right answer lies on the side of “more than today” rather than “less than today”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Monnet famously said that “Europe will be forged in crises, and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.” He was certainly right that further integration will proceed incrementally rather than in a big bang.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">What I hope, though, is that Europe will not be forged in crises only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Significant progress towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union has been achieved in times of acute crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Today’s improved economic environment offers a window of opportunity to demonstrate that progress is possible in quieter times, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">I thank you for your attention and hope you have productive discussions at today’s conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Standard
