    <span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)"> Exchange of Views on the Economic and Social Crisis in Greece Introductory statement by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European ParliamentBrussels, 27 March 2012 Dear Chairwomen, Honourable Members of the European Parliament, The organisation of this hearing once again illustrates to what extent the launch of the euro has brought about economic interconnectedness: in view of the strong implications for the stability of the euro area as a whole, putting Greece back on its feet is in the very interest of all of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Political interconnectedness could also hardly be better demonstrated than today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Domestic policies have become European – which fully justifies to discuss them at European level, both in executive and parliamentary fora.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.05,0)">Why the Greek adjustment programme is unavoidable The Greek economic adjustment and its social implications are painful: there is no doubt about this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.01,0)">The question, however, is: how did Greece get in such a situation and does it have any alternative?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The major effort of adjustment reflects the severity of the macroeconomic imbalances that have accumulated over years in Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.09,0)">Misguided economic and fiscal policies, lack of structural reforms: all these policies undermined the sustainability of public debt and created a very large competitiveness gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.68,0)">It is not the adjustment programme which is causing the recent decline in GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.05,0)">The current economic depression is an unavoidable correction of the substantial positive output gap that has built up until 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.77,0)">Is there any alternative to the current adjustment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.48,0)">We do not help Greece by creating false expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.49,0)">Calls for loosening the fiscal stance are illusory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.8,0)">Greece could hardly face larger financial constraints than at the moment: it has lost market access and can only draw on a fixed envelope for official support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">There is only one way forward: restoring fiscal sustainability and competitiveness, which will, in turn, bring back sustained growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">This requires perseverance: perseverance in carrying out fiscal consolidation; perseverance in implementing comprehensive structural reforms; and perseverance in addressing the weaknesses of the Greek banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The efforts undertaken by the Greek government and the sacrifices the Greek public endured so far have been substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.67,0)">But there is still a long way to go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.23,0)">It is no secret that the programme is subject to exceptionally high implementation risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">The debt exchange operation has been successful, official financing has been scaled up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">This has improved debt sustainability prospects: the estimated debt-to-GDP ratio could be brought to about 116½% in 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">But this all depends on one key condition, namely that Greece fully implements the programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.63,0)">Debt dynamics are extremely sensitive to implementation slippages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.24,0)">Delayed fiscal consolidation, lower privatisation proceeds or slower structural reforms: such scenarios would translate into weaker economic growth and worsen again debt sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.22,0)">Without a regime-change in policy implementation and a much broader political consensus in favour of painful, but necessary reforms, there is a high risk that the programme derails.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Therefore, political courage is more needed than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me now comment in some more detail on three key areas: fiscal adjustment, competitiveness gains and financial sector issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Fiscal adjustment The Greek authorities and the Greek people deserve recognition for the significant fiscal adjustment they have achieved over the last two years: despite the deep recession, the general government deficit was reduced by around 6½% of GDP since 2009  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This broadly corresponds to the deficit reduction that was initially envisaged under the programme, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.28,0)">before the 2009 deficit outcome was revised upwards  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This is a remarkable achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.09,0)">Nevertheless, the size of the government is still too large compared to Greece’s capacity to generate and collect fiscal revenues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.84,0)">Moreover, the quality of the fiscal adjustment was mixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">On the one hand, important reforms have started to address Greece’s high level of public wages and employment and the previously unsustainable pension system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.89,0)">On the other hand, fiscal adjustment has so far excessively relied on an increase in tax rates and across-the-board expenditure cuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Looking ahead, further progress in fiscal consolidation requires the implementation of difficult structural fiscal reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Closing the large fiscal gap for 2013-14   will be a litmus test for the government’s commitment to the programme: without the government’s willingness and ability to design and implement the difficult structural fiscal reforms, such a large adjustment cannot be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">I call on Greece’s political class to push through these difficult reforms by confronting vested interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Otherwise the critical mass of structural fiscal reforms necessary to close the medium-term fiscal gap may not be reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Finally, how can we make sure that the economic adjustment burden is being fairly distributed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I know that this is an important concern of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">One essential avenue is the tax administration reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.78,0)">Progress in this regard has been rather disappointing so far: in many cases, wealthy Greeks still contribute less than possible to the overall adjustment effort, partly on account of tax evasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Strengthening revenue administration and fighting tax evasion are crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Not only are they needed to increase revenue; they could also improve the social acceptability of the adjustment programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Competitiveness There has been some improvement in competitiveness under the first programme, but it fell short of what is needed: Greece still faces a substantial competitiveness gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.8,0)">This largely reflects delays in the implementation of labour market and other structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Closing this gap, while remaining in the euro area, will require a more pronounced internal devaluation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">How can it be achieved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.22,0)">How can we reverse the dramatic increase in unemployment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Reducing minimum wages in the private sector, removing rigidities in the wage-setting system: these are key elements of the strategy for accelerating the internal devaluation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">They may not be popular, but there is no way around it if we want to create the basis for renewed competitiveness and employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This is not the only area where decisive action is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Labour market reforms must be complemented by a liberalisation of product and services markets, for example in closed professions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Political willingness is a key ingredient to overcome the resistance of vested interests in these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Bank recapitalisation Last but not least, Greece needs to address the situation of its banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.07,0)">As a consequence of the debt exchange, most Greek banks are heavily undercapitalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">The programme envisages that banks deemed viable by the Bank of Greece will be recapitalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Banks that are unable to raise capital in the market will be recapitalised with programme resources through the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.06,0)">In contrast, banks that are deemed non-viable will be resolved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">It is crucial that the €25 billion earmarked for these purpose as part of the first disbursement be used for the swift injection of capital into Greek banks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The recapitalisation strategy was designed to maximise private sector participation, while preserving the State's interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The banks’ shares acquired by the State in the recapitalisation process will have limited voting rights, but may still allow for upside returns to be shared between the State and private shareholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Whenever possible, the private management of banks will be safeguarded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The governance structure of the recapitalisation and resolution processes will be significantly enhanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">This became necessary owing to the very substantial amount of official financing that will be channelled through the existing Greek institutions, in particular the Hellenic Financial Stability Fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude with a message of hope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Yes, the medicine is bitter, but the patient can and will recover if he follows the prescription.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Looking at successful past experiences of fiscal adjustment in other European countries shows that this is not a lost battle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">However, an absolute prerequisite for the adjustment to succeed is strong political ownership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The Greek people are not reforming their economy and their state to please the troika; they are not carrying out sacrifices to please country X or Y in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">They are going through this adjustment process for their own good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Maximum political ownership should therefore be expected and is key.</span>
