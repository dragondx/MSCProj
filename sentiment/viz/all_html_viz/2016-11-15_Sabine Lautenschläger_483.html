    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.63,0)"> The European banking sector – a quick pulse check Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at a Euro Finance Week Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 15 November 2016 Since the financial crisis of 2008, the health of the banking sector has become one of the hot topics in public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">And with good reason, because banks are important for all of us – in good times and in bad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In good times, banks help to finance enterprises which, in turn, drive economic growth and provide employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.65,0)">In bad times, banks can threaten the financial system and damage the economy – as we have learned during the recent financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Against that backdrop, the purpose of my speech today is to do a quick pulse check and see how European banks are doing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">European banks – more resilient and less profitable Let us begin by talking about the obvious!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">First, banks have become much more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Higher capital buffers are helping them to withstand even severe shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The recent stress test conducted by the European Banking Authority confirmed the increased resilience of European banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.45,0)">However, that rather benign finding seems to be contradicted by the collective pulse check that is conducted by the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.88,0)">Since the beginning of the year, the share prices of European banks have fallen by more than 20%, on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.78,0)">It seems that, in the view of the markets, European banks are not that healthy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.02,0)">The diagnosis is not a lack of stability but a lack of profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.85,0)">And indeed, the return on equity of large banks in the euro area is mostly still below the estimated cost of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.48,0)">Attempts to explain this lack of profitability have focused on low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.72,0)">It is true, of course, that low interest rates are a challenge for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Still, we should not completely ignore their positive effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">They reduce funding costs for banks and support the economy, which also indirectly benefits banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.5,0)">But it is not just low interest rates that pose a challenge to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.89,0)">Other issues play a role, too: high costs eat into profits; non-performing loans weigh down balance sheets; and fee-generating business has become more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.97,0)">Digitalisation has introduced fintech companies as new competitors, and the banking landscape in general is still characterised by overcapacities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.9,0)">This increases competition and depresses margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">European banking supervision – a comprehensive treatment plan Banks have become more resilient, but they do operate in an environment that is characterised by constant change and constant competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In order to retain their resilience and preserve their profitability, banks have to change as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.81,0)">Most importantly, they have to rethink their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">From our perspective as supervisors, the viability of business models is currently one of the main points of attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">While it is not our role to tell banks how they should operate, we must warn them against the temptation to prop up their profits by taking on too much risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.32,0)">An excessive search for yield could easily lead to new troubles for the banks themselves and the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.38,0)">And against the backdrop of low profitability, abundant liquidity and high competition, this is not a purely hypothetical concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">As a result, we are not only scrutinising business models and profitability drivers, but are also taking a close look at risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is reflected in our supervisory priorities today and for the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In a nutshell, effective risk management rests on two pillars: sound governance structures and high-quality data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">With regard to internal governance, we recently published the results of a thematic review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Its conclusion: many euro area banks need to improve the way they conduct business and manage their risks in order to achieve international best practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">With regard to data quality, the “Principles for effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting” published by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2013 are a suitable benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We will closely monitor whether banks are applying these principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Another important issue in the context of risk management is the internal models that banks use to calculate their risk-weighted assets which, in turn, serve as a basis for determining capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">For the next three years we will conduct a targeted review of these internal models in order to ensure consistent model outputs and restrict unjustified variability in the calculation of risk-weighted assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Through our review, we will gain in-depth knowledge of the internal models for credit and market risk used by European banks, as well as of their standards and best practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">We will put this knowledge to use for several objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Our follow-up decisions, in particular when approving models and requesting improvements or add-ons, will contribute to a level playing field regarding the calculation of capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">We will also use the knowledge we acquire to hone our supervisory expectations and our guidance for banks regarding credit and market risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">And we will base our position in international supervisory and regulatory groups on the knowledge and experience we gain during the project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Our review is certainly a huge project – in 2017 alone, we will be conducting more than 100 assessments, each of them covering three to four models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Nevertheless, the benefits will be equally large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In addition to business models and risk management, we are currently focusing on a third issue: credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Most prominently, this includes the issue of non-performing loans that I mentioned before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.61,0)">It is the banks themselves that have to tackle this issue as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.93,0)">However, they sometimes face obstacles in the form of inadequate national legislation and national judicial frameworks, as described in the stocktake of national practices we published in September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Here, policymakers can play an important role by reforming relevant legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">As supervisors, we can assist the banks by pointing out best practices and ensuring that they are applied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.87,0)">Today, we will close the public consultation on our guidance for banks on dealing with non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">That guidance takes the form of recommendations to banks and defines a number of best practices that we have identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It sets out our supervisory expectations and serves as a basis for supervisors to evaluate how banks handle non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, to sum up: banks are more resilient than they were just a few years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">However, they still have to improve their fitness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">They have to adjust to a new economic environment; they have to adapt to the digital world; and they have to become more efficient and deal with legacy assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This is no small task, but it has to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Moreover, the banks have to get used to a new regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">That framework should be finalised by the end of the year, and it should be finalised at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Banking became a global sector years ago, and regulation must follow in order to ensure stability.</span>
