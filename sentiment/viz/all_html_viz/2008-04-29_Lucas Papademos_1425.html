    <h2> Presentation by Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the ECB at the press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the second edition of the ECB Report on financial integration in Europe Frankfurt am Main, 29 April 2008 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Lucas Papademos </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)"> Financial integration in Europe Presentation by Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the ECBat the press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the second edition of the ECB Report on financial integration in EuropeFrankfurt am Main, 29 April 2008 I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, On behalf of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, I would like to welcome you to this press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the second edition of the ECB’s report on “Financial Integration in Europe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The first report on “Financial integration in Europe” was published last year and we intend to release it annually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Its main purpose is to contribute towards the advancement of European financial integration and to raise public awareness of the Eurosystem’s role in supporting the financial integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Before I turn to the content of the report, let me briefly recall why we prepare and publish this report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">The Eurosystem has a strong interest in the integration and the efficient functioning of the financial system in Europe, particularly in the euro area, because it facilitates the performance of our core tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Starting with monetary policy, a well-integrated financial system facilitates the transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Financial integration is also highly relevant to the Eurosystem’s role in safeguarding the stability of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">More integrated financial markets enhance the opportunities for sharing and diversifying risk and increase the market liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">At the same time, a more closely integrated financial system also raises the scope for spill-over effects and contagion across borders, as the recent financial market turmoil has manifested.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Financial integration is also fundamental to our task of promoting the smooth operation of payment systems and of securities clearing and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Finally, without prejudice to our primary objective of price stability, we support the general economic policies of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The completion of a single market for capital and financial services is an important policy priority which should foster the efficiency and development of the European financial system and help increase potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The ECB and the entire Eurosystem fully support the efforts of the private sector and the EU institutions to enhance the integration and development of the European financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In this respect, the ECB works very closely with the European Commission, which has a primary responsibility in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The ECB report complements the work of the Commission in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I now turn to the content of the report and will highlight some of the main findings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.2,0)">The report consists of three chapters  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The first chapter sets out the ECB’s assessment of the state of financial integration in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This assessment is based on a set of quantitative indicators we have developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The second chapter contains in-depth analyses of selected issues relating to financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The final chapter of the report gives an overview of the activities of the Eurosystem in 2007 aimed at advancing the integration and development of financial markets in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The state of financial integration in Europe Let me start with the ECB’s assessment of the state of financial integration in the euro area which covers the money, bond, equity and banking markets, as well as the underlying market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The tables on this slide   and on the following one summarise our assessment of the degree of integration in the various market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Two key facts should be highlighted: first, financial integration is generally more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy; and, second, it depends on the degree of integration of the respective market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">These conclusions confirm the findings of last year’s report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">In particular, the unsecured money market has been fully integrated since the introduction of the euro, and the repo market is also highly integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The full integration of the large-value payment systems has been instrumental in achieving this result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Government bond markets have also become considerably integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Similarly, the corporate bond market received a major boost with the introduction of the euro and has subsequently achieved a high degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Some progress has also been made in the integration of euro area equity markets, although the euro area securities infrastructure that underpins both bond and equity markets is not yet sufficiently integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">However, efforts to reduce these barriers are currently under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Turning to the banking markets  , integration has advanced well in the fields of wholesale banking and capital-market activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.9,0)">The integration of the retail banking market has, however, been slow and hampered by the fragmentation of the European payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">After this broad overview, allow me to illustrate some specific developments in particular market segments, also with reference to the recent episode of financial turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.39,0)">In this context, a pertinent question is whether the financial market turmoil has had an impact on the degree of integration in various market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">First, with regard to the nearly fully integrated money markets, the recent financial turmoil has undoubtedly left a mark on the cross-country standard deviation of the unsecured interbank lending rates, as you can see from this chart  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.43,0)">Looking at this graph, one may wonder whether the turmoil has in fact led to a higher segmentation, and therefore, less integration, in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In response, let me now show you a related indicator for the secured money market which strongly suggests that this is not likely to be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.05,0)">As you see in the chart  , the cross-country standard deviation of the interbank repo rates does not seem to have been similarly affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">As credit risk is an important element in the unsecured markets, but not so in the secured markets, this may lead us to conclude that the increase in differences in credit risk across institutions, rather than increased segmentation, is the likely explanation for the observed small but noticeable increase in the cross-country standard deviation in interbank lending rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Of course, we continue to monitor the evolution of these and other indicators very closely in the coming months in order to obtain more information on the possible effects of the turmoil on the money markets as well as on other financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.64,0)">I already mentioned that retail banking markets continue to be less integrated than other banking market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.28,0)">The dispersion of total assets of euro area bank branches and subsidiaries across euro area countries illustrates the point  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The horizontal line within the pillars shows the median share of assets for both types of establishments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.21,0)">Whereas the median share of assets of foreign subsidiaries increased to 14.4% last year, the median share of assets of foreign branches slightly decreased, reaching 2.0%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.02,0)">III Special features The second chapter of the report contains four “Special Features”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">These are in-depth assessments of policy issues relating to financial integration that are of particular relevance to the Eurosystem’s tasks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This year, we selected the following topics:   concepts and measures of financial development;   the STEP initiative;   the integration and development of mortgage markets; and   the integration of large-value payment and securities transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Out of these four, I should like to focus on two, namely on financial development and on the integration of mortgage markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.99,0)">III.1.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Financial Development The special feature on financial development goes beyond financial integration and looks into other elements that affect the performance of the financial system  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The concept of financial development is introduced and is related to other concepts such as financial integration, efficiency and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">More precisely, financial development refers to the process of financial innovation, institutional and organisational improvements that reduce asymmetric information, increase the completeness of markets and contracting possibilities, lower transaction costs, and enhance competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">In particular, financial development is complementary to financial integration in reducing market frictions and fostering financial market efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This chart   presents a simple framework to summarise the determinants of the performance of the financial system and its links to the performance of the broader economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.43,0)">There are three levels of analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.57,0)">The first level concerns the fundamentals of the financial system that do not change very fast, such as legal and regulatory frameworks or features of the economy’s financial structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The second level relates to the performance of the financial system, that is, its efficiency and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The third level focuses on the performance of the economy as a whole, that is, economic growth and price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.77,0)">As you can see, financial integration and financial development are processes that influence the relationship between the fundamentals of the financial system and its performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">A selection of indicators is provided in this Special Feature to monitor financial development and efficiency  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">These indicators can be grouped into general and market-specific indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">An example of general indicators is the size of capital markets, which aggregates the sizes of stock, bond and loan markets, as a percentage of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.21,0)">On average, euro area capital markets tend to be smaller than those in the United Kingdom and the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me continue with some examples of market-specific indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.91,0)">This chart   shows the notional amounts of nominal outstanding interest rate derivatives, that is, forward rate agreements, options, and swaps, by currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">By using derivatives, market participants can better manage risks, lock in the future price of the underlying assets and even alter the terms of the underlying financial contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">As a consequence, the allocation of capital and risk across time and space is improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The chart clearly shows that the most active interest rate derivative markets are those denominated in euro and in the US dollar, with outstanding amounts in 2006 of 86 and 75 trillion euro, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Focusing on the evolution of the interest rate derivatives market over time, this chart   shows that the US-dollar denominated interest rate derivatives grew the fastest, with the amount outstanding increasing sixfold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">The second fastest growing markets were the interest rate derivatives denominated in euro and in pound sterling, which both quadrupled from 1999 to 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Securitisation of illiquid bank assets is a form of financial innovation that has expanded substantially in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This chart   shows the extent of off-balance sheet securitisation via asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities relative to gross domestic product  , using the location of the underlying collateral to link this financial innovation to countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">According to this indicator, the United States is by far the most active market for securitising mortgages and receivables such as car loans or credit card loans: the volume of issuance amounted to 25% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.8,0)">In the euro area, the average volume of issuance was only 2% of the GDP, with Spain, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Ireland and Portugal having the highest levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.86,0)">The lack of integration in European mortgage markets partly explains these facts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">It also suggests that the ease with which issuers of asset-backed securities in one country can include illiquid assets from other European countries is an important factor that will influence the evolution of securitisation in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Another example of a market-specific indicator of financial development is the total amount of venture capital financing as a share of GDP  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Despite having grown substantially over the past ten years, venture capital financing remains only a fraction of the UK and US figures in most euro area countries, with the exception of Finland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">To sum up, on the basis of the indicators identified so far, it can be concluded that there still exists a fair degree of heterogeneity in financial development across markets and countries in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">On average, the euro area financial system compares well to a group of benchmark countries, except perhaps relative to the United Kingdom and the United States, which perform better on the basis of most of the indicators presented in the report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">There is certainly room for further analysis and assessment of financial development by enhancing the existing indicators and by identifying new ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">And there is room for structural reforms that can foster financial market efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">III.2 The Short-Term European Paper   initiative The second Special Feature, entitled “The STEP initiative”, describes how the ECB and the Eurosystem can act as a catalyst for private sector activities and, in this way, promote financial integration in the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.74,0)">The Short-Term European Paper   initiative to develop a pan-European short-term paper market originated from the observation that the short-term securities market had been the least integrated money market segment since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The STEP label, given to issuance programmes that comply with a core set of commonly agreed market standards and practices, provides market participants across the euro area with a common framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Since its launch in 2006, the STEP initiative has already yielded significant progress in market integration and transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">III.3 Mortgage markets in Europe The third special feature of the Report on which I will elaborate, given its topicality, concerns the integration and development of mortgage markets in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Mortgage markets are an important part of the euro area financial system: the provision of mortgage loans is a key financial service for households; mortgages accounted for almost 30% of total bank loans and about 60% of the household liabilities; and asset-backed securities – of which mortgage-backed securities represent a large share – have become an important source of collateral, accounting for approximately 16% of all collateral deposited with the Eurosystem, a slightly larger fraction than central government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.43,0)">Mortgage markets are very important, yet they remain one of the least integrated financial markets in Europe and progress towards further integration has been slow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is partly due to natural barriers, such as language, affinity and consumer preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.26,0)">However, other factors such as domestic infrastructures and differing legal and consumer protection frameworks create barriers that can, and should, be addressed by policy-makers and market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The chart on slide 19 on new housing loans in euro area countries, classified by the period of interest rate fixation, illustrates the diversity in the mortgage lending markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In general, not only the use of fixed and variable rate mortgages, but also early repayment and prepayment options and loan maturities vary considerably across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Similarly, diversity prevails on the funding side of mortgage markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The chart on slide 20 illustrates the relative importance of residential mortgage-backed securities   and covered bonds in the national markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.52,0)">The dominance of only one type of instrument in most countries is related to the presence of long-established legal frameworks, or the existence of certain legal or other obstacles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Consequently, there seems to be room to improve the availability of different mortgage funding instruments in euro area countries as well as in other EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">This Special Feature examines in considerable detail the potential implications of further integration in European mortgage markets for the monetary policy transmission mechanism and for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Overall, the Eurosystem’s assessment is that further integration of mortgage markets is desirable because it is likely to bring about a more uniform transmission of monetary impulses and a more stable financial system as a result of improved risk diversification  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.78,0)">At the same time, the process of financial integration may entail certain risks to monetary and financial stability, such as increased vulnerability of domestic financial systems to external shocks and intense competition that may lead to an erosion of credit standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">So while we strongly support further integration in mortgage markets, we are also of the view that this process should be carefully monitored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">That said, full integration of mortgage markets is a process that is likely to take many years and will largely be driven by market forces  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">We believe that market participants’ actions will help achieve significant further progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">For example, they can increase market transparency, improve statistics, promote standardised mortgage products and develop market benchmarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Within the scope of its competencies, the ECB stands ready to support such market initiatives, as we have done in the area of short-term securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">III.4 Integration of large-value payment and securities transactions: TARGET2, T2S, CCBM2 The final Special Feature, entitled “Integration of large-value payment and securities transactions: TARGET2, TARGET2-Securities and CCBM2”, considers the advances towards an integrated and well-functioning European market infrastructure, focusing on the contribution of the Eurosystem  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">During the run-up to the introduction of the euro, the Eurosystem established the TARGET system and the Correspondent Central Banking Model   which enabled the area-wide settlement of large-value transactions in central bank money and the cross-border delivery of collateral to the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">While these were undoubtedly already major steps towards the integration of crucial market infrastructures, TARGET and CCBM did not yet allow market participants to manage their cash, collateral and securities positions in an integrated way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.11,0)">The recent establishment of TARGET2 as a centralised technical service addresses this shortcoming for euro-denominated large-value and urgent payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">It also enables the move towards a fully integrated infrastructure in the fields of securities settlement, liquidity and collateral management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The envisaged TARGET2-Securities project and the Collateral Central Bank Management   facilities, together with TARGET 2, are “second generation” services, which represent a quantum leap forward in the integration and quality of the euro area core infrastructure, with substantial benefits for financial market integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Eurosystem activities to promote financial integration I now turn to the report’s third chapter, titled “Eurosystem activities for financial integration”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.44,0)">It provides an overview of the main Eurosystem activities in 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The ECB and the Eurosystem contributed to financial integration and development in a number of ways, building on their expertise and special nature as public institutions which are both active in the market and have close interaction with market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We distinguish between four types of activities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">First, we give advice on the legislative and regulatory framework for the financial system and make rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">A good example is the Eurosystem’s contribution to the first full review of the Lamfalussy framework last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The Eurosystem reiterated its support to the Lamfalussy framework subject to some necessary functional enhancements within the current institutional framework and in particular emphasised the need for intensification of cooperation and information-sharing between supervisors and central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Second, we seek to act as catalysts for private sector activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">In this regard, we have been instrumental in the success of the short-term European paper, or STEP, initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">This initiative aims to promote the integration of short-term paper market through the voluntary compliance of market players with a core set of standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The outstanding amount of euro-denominated STEP-labelled securities already accounts for about 30% of all euro-denominated short-term paper placed by non-government issuers worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Third, we enhance knowledge, raise awareness and monitor the state of European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This Report, and the indicators of financial integration that are presented here, are an illustrative example of this type of activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Fourth, we provide central bank services that also foster European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As an example, I choose our wholesale payment system, TARGET2.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The successful launch of this single technical platform in November last year marks a significant milestone in financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">TARGET2, replacing TARGET, provides for a harmonised service level, a single price structure, and a harmonised set of cash settlement services in central bank money for all “ancillary” systems, such as retail payment systems, clearing houses and securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">All central banks and TARGET users will have migrated to TARGET2 by 19 May this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.02,0)">V Concluding remarks This brings me to the end of my presentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Central banks are at the core of financial systems and therefore closely follow developments which can foster integration  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The ECB and the entire Eurosystem devote a substantial amount of resources to this task, because we are convinced that progress in this area is important for the European economy, within the framework established by the Lisbon agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Finally, I should also like to stress that, while financial integration is an important driver for increasing the efficiency of a financial system, financial efficiency also depends on financial development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Therefore, future reports are envisaged to encompass analysis and assessment of the various factors determining the efficient functioning of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The special feature on financial development that I presented is a first step in this direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I am now at your disposal for questions.</span>
