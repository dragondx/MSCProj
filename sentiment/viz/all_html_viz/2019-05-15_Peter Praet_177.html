    <span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)"> On the importance of institutions as provider of stability and protection in an uncertain world Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Steptoe Brussels Open Conference Series, Brussels, 15 May 2019 Uncertainty and economic developments  The economic literature – both theoretical and empirical – finds a link between heightened uncertainty and lower economic activity in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.32,0)">There are usually fixed costs involved with investment, from creating new capital such as building a factory to hiring new staff, which cannot be recovered if the investment decision is reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.59,0)">So faced with an increase in uncertainty, businesses pare back investment plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.49,0)">Similarly, if households fear unemployment or lower income from employment in the future they may reduce consumption today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.07,0)">Last observation refers to: April 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.13,0)">The literature uses a number of different measures of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.66,0)">Such measures usually move with each other, and generally peak in recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The indicator for euro area economic policy uncertainty still appears relatively elevated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.03,0)">This measure counts how frequently newspaper articles cite “uncertainty”, “economy” or similar, and particular policy words, such as “deficit” or “regulation”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.41,0)">A number of recent events have sparked this rise in uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.42,0)">World trade policy uncertainty resulting from the negotiations initiated by the US with its trading partners as illustrated by the indicator for US trade policy uncertainty, the protracted process of withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, and the policy uncertainty resulting from the rise of populism show how pervasive uncertainty is in today’s world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.12,0)">These recent bouts of political and policy uncertainty have come on top of the existing and more enduring sources of “structural” uncertainty about the economic outlook in advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">What do we really know about the impact of new technologies and innovation on tomorrow’s economic landscape?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.19,0)">Will secular stagnation be the new economic reality?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Various authors have suggested that recent innovations have had only limited effect on productivity and growth in advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.03,0)">Others have expressed concern that these innovations may polarise societies still further and may even have negative effects on employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Technology optimists meanwhile predict the advent of a bright future, with the diffusion of innovation bringing about significant productivity increases and high levels of well-being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It is important for us economists to be humble when forecasting the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Debating concepts such as ‘secular stagnation’ may be fashionable now, but we should remember only a decade ago it was fashionable to debate the ‘Great Moderation’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Uncertainty about the future has always been with us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.0,0)">The incidence of natural disasters such as droughts, floods and earthquakes, the doubt of whether contractual promises will be honoured and the fear of your possessions being taken by force are all factors that can affect economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Humankind, over the millennia, has put in place various mechanisms to help cope with uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">For example, putting in place narratives to filter and process the vast array of information available and arrange it in order to guide people’s expectations about an uncertain future, thereby making it possible for societies to coordinate their efforts towards the common good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">In this respect, building institutions has been key to providing economic stability, as they can best create an environment of trust in the future by implementing policies reducing the impact of uncertainty on economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.53,0)">The importance of economic narratives Following financial crises, political uncertainty is often elevated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">According to a recent study,  votes for extreme parties can increase by on average 30%, while government majorities shrink, parliaments end up with a larger number of parties and become more fractionalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.54,0)">Thus the political landscape becomes more gridlocked at precisely the moment when decisiveness is typically required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.21,0)">This can delay necessary policy responses, such as cleaning up the financial sector, which prolongs the post-crisis recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.68,0)">And such uncertainty, reflected in the media, can gradually build a narrative of doom and gloom around the economy or around the existing institutions – a seeping pessimism, which over time alters investors’ and consumers’ expectations, and thereby their behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.28,0)">Robert Schiller  has elaborated on the epidemiology of narratives relevant to economic fluctuations, ranging from the Great Depression of the 1930s, to the Great Recession of 2007-2009 and today’s climate of political uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Popular narratives can drive economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.98,0)">For example, when people hear stories of declining prices and then postpone their purchases: talking about deflation feeds deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But the relationship is more than just one way: actual events play some role in the development of popular narratives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Overall, popular narratives act as a potent multiplier of economic shocks – the “animal spirits” of Keynes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Today’s information and communication technologies have opened up a vast field of research into the role of narratives as determinants of economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">These technologies have also greatly accelerated the diffusion of narratives in our societies; it is surprising how easily fake news can flourish nowadays.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.63,0)">This is a serious matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.19,0)">The outcome of the UK referendum can be partly attributed to the decades-long development and spread of negative popular narratives about European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">More generally, the events I mentioned earlier are the culmination of a broader narrative against free trade that has gained traction in advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.19,0)">As narratives often are key determinants of economic and political outcomes, it is important to be wary of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">The stabilising role of institutions Institutions contribute to stability, especially in times of uncertainty, and help anchor expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In times of political gridlock, effective institutions are vital since they can deliver their mandates decisively and outside of the push-and-pull of the political process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.44,0)">This in turn foreshortens the crisis and the self-fulfilling cycle of weak economic performance and gloom-and-doom narratives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For example, while bank failures are always possible, the existence of appropriate institutions can mitigate their impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">A sound supervisory framework makes failures less likely, while resolution plans contribute to seamless unwinding of failed institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The move over recent decades to grant independence to central banks owes much to the problem of time consistency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">When monetary policy was under the control of governments, there was always an incentive to “cheat” and deliver higher than expected inflation to temporarily increase output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.63,0)">The existence of this incentive, and the inability of governments to credibly commit to the right policy, gave rise to de-anchored inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Independent central banks with a clear mandate to maintain price stability have been successful in anchoring inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Having an explicit price stability objective provides its own stabilising narrative – people can trust the central bank to deliver an inflation rate in line with their mandate, and can therefore base their economic decisions on that expected inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">In recent years, the ECB has been an anchor of stability, creating an effective bulwark against deflationary narratives when they appeared in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">But institutions need to be strong in order to deliver in the face of shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.52,0)">To put this in perspective, consider how two periods of global economic integration have fared under different institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Global economic integration has fluctuated over time and is now higher than at any time in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.43,0)">Another period of high integration, in the decades prior to World War I, ended abruptly as a financial crisis of global proportions, accompanied by a credit crunch, broke apart bilateral arrangements and paved the way for several rounds of retaliatory tariff increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Multilateralism has been a cornerstone of economic expansion since World War II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The current legal framework for world trade, embodied in the multilateral World Trade Organization, has proven much more robust to the recent global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">It has played a key role in preventing the re-emergence of protectionism in the aftermath of the Great Recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Three stylised facts emerge from comparing the evolution of world trade in goods in the periods 1922-38 and 2001-16.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">First, the pre-crisis expansion was very similar in both eras.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.57,0)">Second, world trade collapsed in 1930 and 2009, immediately after the two shocks, but the decline was sharper in 2009, even though the total decline in the 1930s was larger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Third, the subsequent recovery has been noticeably stronger in the most recent episode.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">1922-1938 trade flows are constructed using current country borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">On both occasions, falling output was the main driver of the trade collapse, but protectionism after the Great Depression was largely due to the emergence of a new political constituency opposed to free trade which, in many cases, was able to develop convincing narratives for the continuation of protectionism even when the crisis was over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The current multilateral framework has so far shielded us against the adverse consequences of protectionist pressures for economic prosperity Institutions provide stability by their very nature of being hard to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.76,0)">But that inertia can lead them to lack the agility to deal with new challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It is therefore essential for modern institutions to evaluate the impact of their policies and the effectiveness of their strategy on an ongoing basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">There is also a chance for new institutions to be founded to improve on previous arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.82,0)">The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was created in the United States in 1933 to reduce the effect of failed banks on depositors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Following the recent financial crisis, the international institutional architecture was strengthened with the inauguration of the G20 summits and the creation of the Financial Stability Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In the euro area, the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism has strengthened the financial system and made it more resilient to future shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">While the current multilateral framework has so far shielded us against protectionist headwinds, this has not been acknowledged by a significant share of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.24,0)">This can be attributed to the fact that the benefits of globalisation have not always been fairly shared, which risks triggering a setback in economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This calls for further improvements in our institutions and our policy frameworks to manage and share the benefits of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">In particular, progress towards a better European Union is both necessary and welcome, and being constructively critical of our actions and policies is certainly part of this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Yet it is important to acknowledge the progress made so far, to keep a sense of direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Let me therefore take a few moments, then, to remind you of the successes of the post-war institutions in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The European Union as provider of stability and protection The European Union and the Single Market have successfully delivered decades of peace and growing prosperity throughout Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">There has been a steady process of strengthening trade and economic links, based on the foundations of democracy, a strong social model and the rule of law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">These institutions are Europe’s answer to the questions posed by globalisation, a democratic way to reap the benefits of economic integration while still protecting consumers and workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The Single Market is more than just a customs union or a dense network of free trade agreements between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">It is in fact an innovative forward step in economic evolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It provides the legal framework for trade between Member States, underpinned by the four fundamental freedoms – free movement of goods, services, labour and capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This framework is vital to give companies confidence to invest and integrate across national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">For trade to flourish, businesses need to be certain that contracts will be honoured, competition rules will be fairly enforced, property rights respected and standards adhered to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">In ensuring the rule of law, the Single Market reduces barriers to trade, labour mobility and competition and increases technological diffusion between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This is not to say that the European Union is perfect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Strong institutions should always strive to improve, evaluate their strategies and make sure their policies bring more value to citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">We should also be clear about what European institutions are and what they are not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.81,0)">There is a widespread narrative according to which Brussels imposes its decisions on Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Yet all regulations and directives adopted in Brussels are decided according to a political process involving the governments of all Member States, which are all represented in the Council, and elected representatives of all European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The Union has built over time a set of strong institutions for Member States to decide together matters of common interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">But it is important to recognise the tensions that exist between the individual priorities of nation states and the pooling of national sovereignty for mutual gain .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The regulations for the Single Market need to be strong enough to promote innovation, but not so tight that they stifle it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">By the same token, countries have to be able to pursue their own social agendas where these do not clearly clash with the principles of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The principle of subsidiarity is important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Conclusion The successful development of a strong rules-based international order in the aftermath of World War II and the existence of strong institutions at both national and international level should not lead to complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">History has proven that accidents are possible, that protectionism can follow periods of free trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.73,0)">Brexit proves that there is a possibility for European integration to go into reverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.14,0)">A more widespread reversal of European economic integration would durably jeopardise economic prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">In times of global political and policy uncertainty, when the foundations of multilateralism are being challenged and global economic powers are flexing their muscles, it is indispensable for us to take European integration forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">A stronger Union is important to retain influence on global economic developments and to provide security to citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It is therefore essential to debunk the narratives of the critics of the European Union, and to speak up loudly for the EU and its institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">These remarks build on the speech ‘Creating stability in an uncertain world’ I delivered at a SUERF Conference, in London on 23 February 2017  For a more detailed discussion of the economic impact of uncertainty, see “The impact of uncertainty on activity in the euro

rgb(248,255,0)">This measure is derived from a method proposed by Baker, S., Bloom, N., and Davis, S.  , “Measuring economic policy uncertainty”, NBER Working Paper Series No 21633.</span><span
