it will also be fully integrated into our new premises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">The combination of old and new, the former market hall and the new office towers, will create a unique building that will be easily recognisable not only in Frankfurt, but all over Europe and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Another important element of our new building’s design is energy efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The environmental design of the new premises is based on the EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Our target for energy usage will be lower than the current German standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Regenerative energies will be incorporated into the design wherever possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Last, but not least, I would like to say a few words about the landscape design of the new premises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">On completion, the landscaping will substantially increase the amount of green space in the area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Close cooperation with the city authorities has enabled an integrated design on the eastern boundary of the site, which means that the city’s green belt   can be extended from the Ruhrorter Werft on the river out towards the Ostpark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The site of the new ECB premises will be secured in line with the security requirements of a modern central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Our security concept foresees physical components which will be integrated into the modulated landscape design and will not impair the view of the building.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">In this way, the Großmarkthalle will remain visible to its neighbours and those visiting the Ostend area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Let me now turn to the next steps to be taken in the construction of the new premises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">As you know, we are currently carrying out the preliminary construction work, having received the required permit in February.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In this context, the following work is currently being undertaken: Excavation work has begun for the basement of the office towers and the underground staff car park in the south of the site.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.73,0)">The remaining ramp in the old railway delivery area and the two four-storey annex buildings at both ends of the Großmarkthalle are being removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.94,0)">You may have noticed that the bricks that made up the external facade of the annex buildings are being removed by hand, one by one, since some of them will be reused for the renovation of the facade of the hall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">If all goes well, the ECB will announce the general contractor which will carry out the main construction work for the new premises in autumn of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">The company is currently being selected within the framework of a Europe-wide tender procedure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In January 2009, following the construction of the basement slab, the foundation stone is scheduled to be laid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">At the same time, the renovation of the Großmarkthalle will get under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">If all goes as planned, we expect the building work to last around three years, with the building complex being finalised by the end of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">I would like to finish my introductory remarks by expressing my gratitude to the various authorities involved in this project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In particular, I would like to thank Frau Roth and all the staff of the Frankfurt city planning department for their commitment and efficient collaboration in this project, especially during the application process for this building permit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">I can only agree with what was mentioned a moment ago: that the guidelines we received were precise and timely and the communication with the relevant authorities was very well organised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The speed with which our application was handled is further testimony to the excellent collaboration between our New ECB Premises project team and the city authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I thank you for your attention and am now at your disposal for questions.</span>
