    <h2> Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Ninth ECB Statistics Conference, "20 years of ESCB statistics: What's next?", Frankfurt, 10 July 2018 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> 20 years of ESCB statistics: Past achievements and future challenges Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Ninth ECB Statistics Conference, "20 years of ESCB statistics: What's next?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">", Frankfurt, 10 July 2018 Ladies and gentlemen, I believe the words of the late US politician Daniel Moynihan are a good starting point tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">He famously said, “Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but not their own facts”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I would add that the best opinions are certainly rooted in facts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And, since we seem to have entered the age of “alternative facts”, I have been reflecting on what real facts are, and how to defend them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.69,0)">And it’s not just the age of “alternative facts”; it’s also the age of “fake news”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Still, neither of these concepts is entirely new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.35,0)">For as long as there has been public discourse, people have been tempted to propagate their own take on reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And not all of them have been able to resist this temptation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.59,0)">But still, something has changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Today, Twitter and other tools allow almost anyone to communicate with the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.76,0)">And fake news is most successful in creating alternative facts when people stop trusting traditional sources of information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.69,0)">This is what’s happening right now, all around us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.27,0)">Traditional media have come under attack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.45,0)">Some people place as much trust in an anonymous tweet or Facebook post as they do in an article in the Financial Times, Le Monde or El País.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Some people see “fake news” as real news and “alternative facts” as a solid basis for taking decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">So, can data and statistics help to counter “alternative facts” and “fake news”?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Can they help to build a more solid base for making decisions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.59,0)">Well, over the years, it has become somewhat fashionable to doubt the ability of statistics to shed light on the facts, on the truth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.51,0)">I am sure that every statistician in the room has been told more than once that “there are three kinds of lies: lies, damn lies and statistics”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.6,0)">Ironically, the quote has been attributed to so many different people that its true source is unknown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">So tonight, I think we should focus on how we can defend statistics and good data as a source of facts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">One of the key questions is how we can engage with those who doubt us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In my view, there are two things we need to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The first is to admit that real-world statistics have their limits, and to be transparent about how and when we use judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The second is to ensure that we, as institutions and as individual experts, earn people’s trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Statistics is a discipline that is certainly aware of its own limits: it not only acknowledges uncertainty, it quantifies it!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But we must also admit that there is not just scope, but also a need, to apply judgement when producing good data and statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">And trust plays a key role here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">People can trust the ECB and the national central banks to apply expert judgement when it is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">In my speech today, I will focus on key ingredients that have been crucial in building up the ECB’s good reputation over the past 20 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The first is to have good data and to use them well when taking decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The second is to ensure good cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The third is to keep pace with changing times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Good data for good decisions I am aware that the need for good data may seem self-explanatory, especially for an audience of statisticians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But that doesn’t make it less important, particularly in the case of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.03,0)">The stakes are extremely high: whether for monetary policy or banking supervision, our decisions impact the lives of over 340 million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This gives the data we use, and the analysis we carry out, enormous importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Our data need to be reliable and our statistics sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Only then will they be able to form the basis for good decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.65,0)">But not all data are created equal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.5,0)">Even well-collected data may fall short of answering the burning questions of our experts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">With the 2008 crisis, for example, we learned the hard way why better and more granular data are necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Aggregate data provided us with the big picture of the euro area economy and its financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.65,0)">But the big picture was too blurry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.55,0)">And, at times, it was downright misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Money markets were a good example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.36,0)">After all, money markets are where the transmission of monetary policy starts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.42,0)">Prior to the crisis, the ECB collected microdata on these markets through the Euro Money Market Survey, the EMMS for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.35,0)">This survey shed light on what was happening in the money markets during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">For example, in unsecured markets, we could see that euro area banks were taking fewer counterparty risks with banks from other euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.98,0)">But our vision was limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.49,0)">First, we didn’t collect direct information on market rates, so we didn’t know how much each market participant was paying for liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.04,0)">If we had had a full picture of the dispersion of rates, we would have had less need to read between the lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.32,0)">Second, we only published the EMMS annually, which seriously limited the potential for research and analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.37,0)">Research on a crisis that was developing by the hour could not be based on data published once a year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.45,0)">But we understood the shortcomings of the data and got to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In 2016, we started to collect money market statistical reporting, or MMSR, data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.15,0)">The MMSR data include trade-by-trade granular data on four market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This means we receive full information on each trade – the maturity date, the rate, the counterparty, the collateral and more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.7,0)">Data on the unsecured market segment are published every six to eight weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">With this project the ECB took an important step towards the future, becoming a collector of “big data”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.9,0)">But, of course, we didn’t do this on our own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">A tale of cooperation Cooperation is often mentioned at conferences like this one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.63,0)">But in the field of statistics, it is simply a reality that you won’t get very far if you don’t cooperate with others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Projects such as the MMSR would never have come into being without good cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In fact, the genesis of the MMSR involved the central banks of four countries – Germany, France, Italy and Spain – and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And of course, these institutions needed to cooperate with reporting banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">And cooperation happens not only between institutions, but also within institutions: the constant feedback loop between departments using the data and those preparing them leads to high-quality results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">But smooth cooperation has helped us from the start.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">It allowed the Eurosystem to achieve its objectives from day one, 20 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Thanks to a joint effort by the entire Eurosystem, we had a set of harmonised euro area statistics from the very beginning of the ECB’s existence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">And some 16 years later, when European banking supervision came into being, the Directorate General Statistics was able to provide the supervisory data we needed right from the start – thanks to another joint effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Indeed, as the ECB’s functions have expanded, statistics have had to follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.03,0)">And of course, as we have found ourselves needing more data to do our job, banks have found themselves having to report not only more data, but also more granular data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We try at all times to be mindful of the reporting burden that banks have to bear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Regular merit and cost procedures are applied to new data collections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">More recently, we have started to hold public consultations on proposed new statistical reporting requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">This will help to ensure all stakeholders have the chance to express their views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Cooperation also helps us to make reporting more efficient, which in turn reduces the burden on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">And here, we have worked on two fronts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">With the ESCB Integrated Reporting Framework, we aim to aggregate and harmonise banks’ reporting requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">With the Banks’ Integrated Reporting Dictionary, the BIRD, we support banks in organising their data with a view to reporting it more efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Towards this end, experts from national central banks work with experts from commercial banks to define the data and data transformations needed to comply with the reporting requirements for AnaCredit and the Securities Holdings Statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">So, banks that choose to participate are being helped to do a job they would otherwise have had to do on their own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Cooperation with institutions beyond the ESCB has also been vital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The members of the ESCB and the European Statistical System partnership have worked closely to ensure the production of complete and coherent European statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">We – central banks and statistical institutes – have been doing this with remarkable results in the Committee for Monetary, Financial and Balance of Payments Statistics since 1991.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And since 2013, we also meet in the European Statistical Forum to discuss topics of strategic cooperation with the heads of national statistical institutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Keeping pace It’s clear that cooperation is key to getting our job done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.77,0)">But these days, a job well done requires much more than it used to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Central banks need to keep pace with a world that is changing at an ever-faster pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">How do we do that?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">How do we keep pace?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Well, for one thing, we need to be open to new ways of doing things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">On this front, I am sure the two words on everyone’s minds are “big” and “data”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It’s true that we central bankers have not exactly been at the forefront of the big data revolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">After all, we are a bit cautious by nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And we know that big data means different things to different people; and we know that we cannot yet say with certainty which big data applications will be truly useful Big data are quite different from traditional, structured data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">So we have much to learn and many challenges to tackle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.8,0)">Collecting the data is only where the challenges start.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">We also need to adapt verification processes to ensure that the data are of high quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">And this is where big data already pay off, indirectly at least.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Big data has brought us tools and techniques that can be applied to rapidly process large sets of traditional data too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This makes it much easier for us to realise projects like MMSR and AnaCredit and helps us to keep pace with an ever-changing world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.52,0)">AnaCredit, for instance, involves immense sets of extremely granular data, reflecting the far greater complexity and interconnectedness of today’s economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">To understand this complexity and assess the interconnections, we need a very detailed view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And this is exactly what AnaCredit gives us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Thanks to the granular data it provides, we will be better able to understand what is driving credit growth, making it easier to know whether such growth is healthy or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">MMSR, on the other hand, is about speed: money markets move fast and never stop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.14,0)">So taking a snapshot every now and then does not suffice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">We need much faster data, and that’s what MMSR provides.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It allows us to constantly assess who lends how much money to whom in the money market and at what rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This gives us a very clear and quick picture of how the market is structured, how exposed players are to one another and how vulnerable they are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">And MMSR helps us to keep pace in other ways too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Look at the important role benchmark rates play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">They provide anchors for contracts in financial markets and are important for the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The ECB thus decided to develop a benchmark rate: a new daily euro short-term rate, also known as ESTER.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">This rate will complement existing rates by the private sector and serve as a backstop to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The ECB will start publishing ESTER by October 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This project will entail significant challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Every working day, we will need to produce a reliable rate, based on individual transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This will need to happen within a very narrow time frame, while ensuring full quality control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Leadership Ladies and gentlemen, I have talked a lot about past achievements and future challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">And I have talked about the need to work together as a team.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">But, of course, all good teams need good leaders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">And speaking of good leaders brings me to Aurel Schubert.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">As Aurel is due to retire soon, I would like to take the opportunity tonight to say a few words about what he has done for this institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">For eight years now, he has steered the ECB statistics ship with great competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Aurel has made invaluable contributions to some of our most ambitious projects: the granular Securities Holdings Statistics, the MMSR and Anacredit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Thanks to his leadership, supervisory statistics were available from the start of European banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">He helped amend our statistical legal framework to align it with international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But, of course, his career started long before he became Director General of Statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">He has worked in the field since 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Over these past 21 years, he has participated in 90 meetings of the Statistics Committee and chaired 34 of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">He has also been a Vice-Chair of the Irving Fisher Committee, a Co-Chair of the European Statistical Forum, and Chair of the ESRB contact group on data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">All these achievements are facts, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And they show that Aurel knows his subject, thinks strategically and masters the politics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">These are all important aspects of being a good leader.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.09,0)">But they are not the only things that are important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.5,0)">A leader cannot act alone; they rely on other people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">And Aurel is an outstanding people manager.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">I think he can teach us all a thing or two when it comes to forming a team, keeping people motivated, managing change and, most important of all, creating an atmosphere of trust and mutual respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In that sense, I see him as a role model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Aurel, I thank you very much.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, In my speech tonight, I have reminded you of some of your many achievements, both recent and past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.46,0)">But what matters most is not the next big project or the latest database.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">What matters most are the high professional standards which you have all maintained in your work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And, if we want to keep fighting alternative facts with real facts and fake news with real news, you must continue on this path with the same conviction as you started out with in 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.12,0)">And now let me conclude with a fact of life that is all too true: dinner speeches are always too long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.63,0)">There is no way to spin this any other way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">So thank you for all your good work, and thank you for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.06,0)">European Central Bank
