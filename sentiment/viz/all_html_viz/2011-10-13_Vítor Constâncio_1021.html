    <h3> Speaker: Vítor Constâncio </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)"> Economic governance and financial stability Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Meeting of the Contact Committee of the Heads of the Supreme Audit Institutions   of the European Union, Luxembourg, 13 October 2011 Dear Mr President, Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you very much for the invitation to join you today for this seminar on the possible implications of the recent reforms in EU economic governance for EU Supreme Audit institutions and the European Court of Auditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is an apposite time to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Of course, important reforms have already been adopted in a number of policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">These reforms have substantial implications for the use of public funds, both at national and at EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">As such, they deserve close scrutiny from an accountability and public audit standpoint, as you have outlined in a recent position paper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.8,0)">That said, I believe this is not the end of the road.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Europe – and in particular the euro area – must go further and complement its successful monetary union with a genuine economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In my intervention today, I will first focus on the main lessons learned from the crisis for the set-up of economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">I will then review the latest changes in the economic governance rulebook of the euro area, including the first experience with the European Semester as well as progress in financial supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I will close with some reflections on further reforms needed to achieve a true economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Naturally, speaking from the perspective of the European Central Bank I will concentrate my remarks on what is more relevant for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.28,0)">Lessons from the crisis The crisis has laid bare a number of severe shortcomings of the governance framework of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In order to remedy those in a profound and durable manner, we first need to draw the right lessons from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The first lesson was that the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact   did not contribute to fiscal policies consistent with membership of a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In an economic and monetary union, fiscal policies have to be consistent with rates of sustainable growth and price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.56,0)">Instead, despite the “good times” between 1999 and 2008, fiscal policies were largely pro-cyclical: few countries maintained a budgetary position in structural balance and many ran deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Peer pressure to correct imbalances was largely absent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.71,0)">In some cases, this indiscipline precipitated serious fiscal challenges when recession began in late 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.26,0)">In others, fiscal policy reinforced nominal divergence and macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">A more effective SGP is therefore required for all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.95,0)">The second lesson was that disciplining fiscal policy in a monetary union was not enough to avoid instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.83,0)">For some countries the main source of imbalances was not the increase in public debt but rather the surge in private debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">For instance, for Spain whereas the public debt was reduced 26.3 percentage points in relation to GDP between 1999 and 2007, the total private debt increased by 116.2 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">For Portugal while public debt increased in the same period 18.7 percentage points of GDP, the total private debt went up by the much higher figure of 61.5 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.54,0)">However, the euro area lacked an institutional framework to identify and correct macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.53,0)">The result was that large current account imbalances reflected the build-up of public and private sector debt, creating external vulnerabilities that were exposed when the crisis broke.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Establishing a permanent framework for surveillance of such imbalances is essential for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.84,0)">The third lesson was the absence of appropriate frameworks for policy co-ordination in areas essential for competitiveness and sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">For countries that share a single currency and cannot devalue, maintaining nominal price and cost growth in line with the euro area as a whole is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">From 1999 onwards, however, developments have not followed this path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.93,0)">For example, a number of euro area countries internalised the fallacy that temporarily elevated national productivity and inflation rates warranted persistent wages increases out of line with the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.44,0)">That approach could have been valid if inflation differentials were driven by healthy catching-up effects, but in many cases they were largely the outcome of inappropriate macroeconomic policies and debt-financed booms in domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.54,0)">Wage developments were therefore not sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Much greater policy co-ordination is now needed to reinforce the euro area dimension in national income policies and economic policymaking in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In particular that a medium-term inflation rate of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term is the appropriate benchmark at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.17,0)">The fourth lesson was that financial supervision in the Europe was lagging behind financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Monetary union led to a structural increase in financial interlinkages within the euro area, in particular via the growth of systemically relevant large cross-border banking groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.16,0)">Yet, the regime for financial supervision remained fragmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.66,0)">National supervisors that were supposed to supervise cross-border banks had no mechanism to resolve conflicts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.58,0)">The EU level financial services committees had only advisory powers and the ability to issue non-binding guidelines and recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.96,0)">The result was that a large build-up of systemic risk in the financial sector went largely unnoticed – risk which in many cases was ultimately transferred to the balance sheet of the sovereign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">A supervision regime commensurate with the reality of financial integration in the euro area is therefore an urgent need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.01,0)">The final lesson was that sovereign debt challenges in individual euro area countries – no matter their size – can undermine the stability of the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.45,0)">To the surprise of some, “sudden stops” episodes occurred in the euro area, as if the single currency was not a common currency of all members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.42,0)">Since member countries do not control their currency, they are vulnerable to liquidity episodes and multiple equilibria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.15,0)">Creditors’ assessment can change e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.34,0)">by effect of contagion, even when fundamentals would not justify it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.11,0)">The high degree of financial integration within EMU means that, if left unchecked, contagion in the banking sector can spread rapidly via cross-border holdings of sovereign debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.59,0)">For sovereigns themselves, sudden shifts in market re-pricing of risk can lead to unexpected liquidity challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">These dynamics underscore the importance of strengthening the mechanisms that prevent such risks – the SGP, surveillance of broader macroeconomic imbalances, and stronger financial supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">However, the liquidity dry-outs and the contagion risks also call for stronger backstop mechanisms, to provide significant, albeit temporary, liquidity assistance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">For the same reason, a permanent crisis management framework is appropriate for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The general overriding lesson stemming from all these points is that monetary union requires a higher degree of integration in what regards fiscal and macroeconomic policies as well as supervision policies which should involve more controls from the centre and between governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.0,0)">In fact, central bankers have been saying this all along.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.59,0)">Already in 1991, Hans Tietmeyer, Vice- President of the Bundesbank at the time, argued: “Monetary union is not just a technical matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.34,0)">It is in itself, to some extent, a political union”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.05,0)">Ten years later, in 2002, Duisenberg repeated that “to move towards Economic and Monetary Union was a profoundly political act”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">President Jean-Claude Trichet has talked about the need for a “quasi fiscal union” with a true “ European Finance Minister”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.87,0)">Governance was ineffective in the euro area because Member States failed to interiorize all the implications of what they had agreed in Maastricht in 1991.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Sharing a single currency within a single economic and financial market creates high and complex interdependence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This means that decisions taken in some parts of the euro area affect other parts in very direct ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Even more importantly, in a monetary union, some specific national problems can only be dealt with through decisions taken jointly, with a euro area perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Writing into the Treaty that economic policies should be treated as “a matter of common concern” is all well and good, but in practice, economic policy co-ordination was governed by an implicit “principle of non-interference” among governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.07,0)">The essential mutual surveillance could not work if peer pressure degenerated into “peer neglect”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">2) Response to the crisis With the limits to existing governance processes so clearly on display, European leaders have embarked on a major overhaul of the EU economic governance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The reforms undertaken since 2010 were broad based and attempt to address all the five lessons of the crisis that I just mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">These lessons show us that the crisis was an interlinked phenomenon involving the public sector, real sector and financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Consequently, a comprehensive response to the crisis needs to address all these sectors and the ways in which they are interconnected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">There is strong momentum behind reinforcing economic governance to prevent and correct fiscal and broader macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The package of six legislative reforms recently agreed by the Council and the European Parliament, introduces a new surveillance procedure for macroeconomic imbalances, with an alert mechanism based on a scoreboard of key indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.74,0)">An enforcement mechanism allows the Council to fine euro area countries in case of repeated non-compliance with recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.76,0)">This closes an important lacuna in the economic governance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The new legislative package also reinforces the SGP to focus more on fiscal sustainability and reducing government debt levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Important steps have also been taken towards improving policy co-ordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The "European semester" was introduced on 1 January this year to encourage better ex ante co-ordination of economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">From now on, national programmes for fiscal and economic policies will be submitted and assessed at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.6,0)">The first implementation of the European Semester in 2011 was far from optimal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.77,0)">On substance, some stability and convergence programmes and national reform programmes lacked specificity and ambition and were based on implausible macroeconomic assumptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.02,0)">As regards procedures, the time available for the review of the Commission’s recommendations by the Council was too compressed and did not leave sufficient room for a true peer review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Therefore the systematic tendency, at least for a number of countries, to weaken the Commission’s recommendations addressed to them during the Council review was not prevented Euro area leaders have decided to deepen further policy co-ordination by creating the “Euro Plus Pact”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The Pact aims to address deep challenges related to competitiveness and productivity in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.7,0)">However, one of its main weaknesses is that its voluntary and inter-governmental nature risk making it nothing more than a set of political declarations if there is no proper monitoring and follow-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Therefore, making the requirements of the Pact legally binding for euro area countries and anchoring it in the European economic governance framework would strengthen it considerably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Major reforms have already taken place in the field of financial supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Following the recommendations of the de Larosière Report, the European System of Financial Supervisors   was established to reinforce the European framework for micro- and macro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It comprises the three new European Supervisory Authorities   for banking, insurance and securities markets; and the European System Risk Board  , which will monitor, identify and prioritise systemic risks to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">This framework will play an important role in managing the interdependencies of a closely integrated single European financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Nevertheless, the new policy tools at the disposal of the ESAs and ESRB are, for most part, soft tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Only in exceptional cases, such as emergency situations, can the authorities take directly binding measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.86,0)">However, even in such cases the so-called ‘fiscal clause’ applies, which provides that the ESA’s powers cannot impinge on national fiscal responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This arrangement does not go far enough for the euro area, and I will make some suggestions on how to improve it later on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In addition, the Commission will present before the end of the year its proposal to establish an EU framework for cross-border crisis management in the banking sector and the creation of an European resolution regime for financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Finally, euro area leaders have agreed to establish a permanent crisis management facility, the European Stability Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The ESM builds on the ad hoc stability facilities established in 2010 to arrest contagion and thereby preserve overall financial stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">In spite of some shortcomings stemming from the rigidity of its instruments, the creation of the ESM is of enormous importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">3) Looking ahead a.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Making further steps towards a genuine economic union The experience of the first twelve years of EMU - and in particular the current sovereign debt crisis – suggests that the limits of soft policy coordination have been reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.2,0)">Unsound economic and budgetary policies pursued by individual euro area countries can endanger financial stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Such spillovers among euro area countries clearly justify, in my view, deeper integration of fiscal, structural and financial policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">We need a new quality of EMU governance, going well beyond the scope of the recently agreed economic governance package, towards a fully fledged economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Of course, this will not happen overnight and, in line with the step-by-step approach underlying the European construction, there will be a gradual process of further economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In the long run, I see it as inevitable that substantial competences in economic governance, financial integration and supervision and in the field of external representation be transferred from the national to the EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Naturally, this major overhaul of the construction of the Monetary and Economic Union will entail a comprehensive Treaty change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">In the short run, we should focus on how to optimise the current governance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">At the European level, I have already stressed the need to implement in an ambitious manner the economic governance package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Euro area Heads of State and Governments should take responsibility and ownership for economic governance issues – and should therefore meet regularly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The Eurogroup should have a a full-time President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">In addition, internal reforms in the Commission should also be pursued to guarantee its greater independence, for instance through a stronger role for the ECFIN Commissioner in the College, akin to the Competition Commissioner, or the establishment of an independent chief economist in DG-ECFIN.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">All of those reforms at EU level will only have a marginal effect, if not matched by efforts at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">We do not want countries to do the right things just because “Brussels” says so – but because their own citizens want and prescribe it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Euro area Member States should be ambitious in implementing strong national fiscal frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For instance, ‘debt brakes’ in national constitutions serve as a good commitment device that prevents the formation of unsustainable debt levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Moreover, independent national fiscal institutions, producing independent forecasts, should be set-up to avoid any optimistic bias.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">All Member States should implement structural reforms in order to strengthen their competitiveness and employment, increase the flexibility of their economies and enhance their longer-term growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Finally, to enhance the euro area’s growth potential, further progress is needed in the implementation of the Single Market, in particular in the field of services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">b.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Strengthening the euro area dimension of financial supervision The decision of 17 countries to share a common currency has far reaching consequences not only as regards the coordination of their economic policies but also in the field of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">In order to achieve a genuine economic union, financial supervision needs to be substantially improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">In my view, the higher degree of financial integration fostered by the single currency, characterised by a single money market and a particularly close interconnectedness among financial institutions, markets and market infrastructure, should also be reflected in a more centralized financial supervision for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The aim of the euro area should be to construct a supervisory framework that reflects the single market in financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This could take the form of granting the European Banking Authority specific powers for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Another option would be to involve the Eurosystem more closely in the micro-prudential supervision of banks, given that in 12 out of the 17 euro area countries the national central banks have full responsibility in banking supervision and taking into account the trend in a number of countries to confer supervisory tasks to their respective central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Such steps would allow addressing more effectively financial sector imbalances that are particularly dangerous within the euro area – and thus preventing negative feedback loops emerging between the financial sector and the sovereign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">This must be complemented by establishing a European resolution fund with a mechanism for burden-sharing between Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I am fully aware that, in the near term, this is politically not easy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">However, we do see some progress, and be it out of acceptance of factual necessity: the EFSF and the ESM can be used to provide loans for banking sector recapitalisation, which reflects the recognition that crisis management for sovereigns and for financial institutions is increasingly intertwined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Perhaps over time this will provide the foundation for a more integrated European system of public and financial sector crisis management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Ladies and Gentleman, I have outlined the lessons from the crisis and reviewed the recent reforms in the field of economic surveillance and financial supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Improving economic governance is a work in progress and further steps will be needed to achieve a deeper integration to ensure the smooth functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">It is important that those reforms are accompanied by appropriate measures to ensure transparency and accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In this regard, the European Court of Auditors and EU Supreme Audit institutions will have a central role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This is particularly crucial in those areas where public funds are involved, both at national and European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This is important not only for the efficiency of the instruments and institutions of economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is of utmost importance for their accountability and acceptance by EU citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">In addition, your practical experience as guardians of public funds throughout Europe can provide EU policy-makers useful reflections and recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">I am therefore looking forward to today’s discussions and your ideas on how to improve European economic governance.</span>
