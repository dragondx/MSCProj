    <span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)"> Financial innovation and monetary policy Speech by Eugenio Domingo Solans, Member of the Governing Council and of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, delivered at the 38th SEACEN Governors Conference and 22nd Meeting of the SEACEN Board of Governors on "Structural Change and Growth Prospects in Asia - Challenges to Central Banking",Manila, 13 February 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to participate in this SEACEN Governors Conference in Manila.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I would like to share a few thoughts with you today on the significance of financial innovation for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As it is a rather broad topic, I will first make some general remarks on the link between financial innovation and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I will then provide you with a few examples of the challenges that financial innovation poses to monetary policy in means of payment, investment products and financing choices, from the euro area perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In covering these topics, I will refer to specific examples of the relevance of e-finance for monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Despite differences between countries – including factors such as IT infrastructure and the regulatory framework – there is much commonality and convergence in the spread of e-finance, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">there is a common pool of experience on which we all – industrial and emerging countries – could draw for future developments in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">First of all, it is necessary to define the concept of financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Financial innovation refers both to technological advances which facilitate access to information, trading and means of payment, and to the emergence of new financial instruments and services, new forms of organisation and more developed and complete financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">To be successful, financial innovation must either reduce costs and risks or provide an improved service that meets the particular needs of financial system participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">From this point of view, I can say that the euro has been one of the world's most important financial innovations in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">It has both reduced transaction costs and eliminated exchange rate risks, and has also acted as a catalyst for a number of improvements in various areas that have helped to create a more efficient financial system in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let me now turn to the implications of financial innovation for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.41,0)">Financial innovation and monetary policy As financial innovation is a continuous process, it is difficult, in practice, to grasp all of its contours; and even more difficult to predict its consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.54,0)">Therefore, financial innovation adds an element of uncertainty to the economic environment in which central banks operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">If financial innovation improves the efficiency of the financial system, then it should also have a considerable effect on the functioning of the economy in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">For example, insofar as financial innovation improves the availability of funds for business activities that might not have otherwise taken place, it is likely to have a positive impact on longer-term economic growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is at least one reason why central bankers need to be aware of financial innovation trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The development of innovative means of payments reduces transaction costs, thereby facilitating trading and the exchange of goods and services, which in the end should lead to a better allocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In the long term, this should be favourable for economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">The important thing – and this is another way in which financial innovation promotes growth and perhaps even dampens the business cycle – is the proliferation of new financial products that help to make markets more complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">This is, for instance, the case of the development of financial technology such as derivatives and securitisation, which, by enabling risks to be unbundled and repackaged, has greatly expanded the range of tradable risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">As a result, markets have become deeper and more liquid, and prices have become more competitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.29,0)">Another reason why central banks have to closely follow developments in financial innovation is that some developments may change the way in which the economy reacts to monetary policy, or may affect the information content of the indicators that central banks regularly monitor and that serve as a basis for taking policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">In this respect, the monetary policy strategy of the ECB is well suited to deal with the challenges posed by financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The ECB's strategy, which includes the analysis of various monetary and non-monetary indicators, constitutes a "full-information" framework, which allows information derived from different sources and using different approaches to be cross-checked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This eclectic and diversified approach, incorporating a broad range of data and analysis, tries to take into account the influence of financial innovation on the economy in order to better understand the risks to price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Let me elaborate on this by focusing on the particular cases of financial innovation in means of payment, in investment products and in financing choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.93,0)">Financial innovation in means of payment Turning first to financial innovation in means of payment, developments in payment media and systems have started to create close substitutes for banknotes, thus affecting a core part of central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This is, for example, the case with the generalisation of the use of debit and credit cards, which facilitate the use of electronic means of payment, thereby speeding up the velocity of narrow money and substituting for the use of physical cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">More importantly, payment cards have also enabled the issuance of electronic money  , which directly rivals physical cash in small-value payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">E-money can be defined as an electronic store of monetary value on a technical device that may be widely used for making payments to undertakings other than the issuer, without necessarily involving bank accounts in the transaction but acting as a prepaid bearer instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The ECB has studied the issue of e-money in depth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.32,0)">The main motivation for this was concern that e-money developments might endanger the function of money as a unit of account for economic transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For this reason, a "redeemability" requirement for electronic money has been laid down in European Union legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This ensures that the unit of account function of money is preserved, as holders of e-money can always exchange it into banknotes at par.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In addition, the reserve base of the ECB's reserve requirements can be extended to issuers of electronic money so as to treat it in a similar way to short-term bank deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The reserve requirements also safeguard the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Indeed, as long as some form of ultimate recourse to central banks remains, the ability of central banks to influence money market interest rates will be maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.12,0)">E-money may also have an effect on the information content of monetary variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">However, the ECB collects data and compiles statistics on electronic money and can, therefore, monitor the evolution of this phenomenon appropriately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Overall, with these measures in place, the ECB does not expect its ability to maintain price stability to be endangered by the development of electronic money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.22,0)">In any case, e-money schemes have thus far had problems in achieving a critical mass in Europe and their spread has been slowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There are currently 25 different card-based schemes in Europe, which are mostly operated by financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">At the end of December 2002, the total stock of electronic money in circulation amounted to €240 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The use of software-based e-money   also remains negligible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.38,0)">Most software-based e-money initiatives in recent years closed down before they were able to operate on a wider scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.72,0)">All in all, electronic money still represents a very small fraction of total money: it corresponds to only 0.1% of banknotes and coins in circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.16,0)">Therefore, the practical relevance of electronic money for economic analysis remains very limited at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.78,0)">Looking a long way ahead, there may be additional issues related to the widespread issue of e-cash by private non-banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The plans of some national authorities to issue e-cash with legal tender status are rather unique.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The ECB follows with interest the development of such plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.36,0)">I would like to mention here some issues arising from a central bank issuing e-money that depend on the relationship between privately and publicly provided e-money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.93,0)">One option is that a central bank could hold a monopoly on the issuance of electronic money, forcing private issuers to procure legal tender from the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Alternatively, the official e-money is introduced alongside its private counterparts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Under this option the central bank would have an advantage over other issuers because central bank e-cash would presumably be more trusted and would eventually become the dominant form.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Furthermore, if a central bank wants to play a leadership role in the local development of electronic money, it should look at the experiences of others, some not far from here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">At the ECB we look at them with interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Some countries, for instance, have chosen to play a co-ordinating role in the industry-led standardisation process, while others have defined standards for private initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In the common pool of experience I mentioned earlier, the euro area can offer the case of Finland whose central bank contributed directly to establishing the infrastructure for the new payment instruments in its country in the early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The usefulness of having a common pool of experience leads me to an additional but rather different point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This relates to the leapfrogging opportunities offered by e-finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.25,0)">In some countries whose financial systems have limited services and less-developed financial infrastructure, the use of electronic cash and multipurpose cards offer savings and payment services to customers who could not be reached via more traditional forms of finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">In some cases, e-finance allows financial services to be delivered in such countries from offshore, providing the additional benefits of international technology and oversight, but creating, at the same time, additional repercussions on the effectiveness of local monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.94,0)">Financial innovation in investment products As far as the introduction of new instruments for financial investment purposes is concerned, the emergence of new financial products may lead economic agents to substitute money with other types of assets, potentially affecting the information content of those assets and the demand for money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is straightforward when the new instruments are close to instruments with monetary character included in broader monetary aggregates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, the effect of financial innovation on monetary aggregates does not necessarily concern only close substitutes for money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Indeed, standard finance theory prescribes that economic agents should hold diversified portfolios including assets with a varied spectrum of risk-return combinations and, partly related to this, of varying degrees of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Therefore, the impact of financial innovation on monetary aggregates can also come about, for example, through the emergence of new instruments which, although illiquid and risky, offer a sufficiently high return to motivate economic agents to substitute part of their holdings in monetary assets for these alternative instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.26,0)">Potentially, this can have destabilising effects on money demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The ECB's monetary policy strategy is designed in such a way that monetary policy decisions can take account of the consequences of financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The ECB does not react in a mechanistic way to monetary aggregates, but instead carefully analyses monetary developments and their information content for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In addition, by cross-checking the information from monetary developments with that of a wide range of non-monetary economic variables, monetary policy is made robust to possible effects of financial innovation on money demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.13,0)">Financial innovation in financing choices Another channel through which financial innovation may affect monetary policy is the developments on the financing side, which may have important consequences for the monetary transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Traditionally, the euro area economy has been dominated by bank lending, in contrast to other economies such as the United States, where securities markets play a much larger role in channelling savings towards investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">In recent years, we have seen a move towards more finance being raised in the form of securities issuance in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In particular, the corporate bond market grew substantially, presenting corporations with a viable choice as to where they obtain their funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">While the slowdown in economic activity in the euro area last year obviously had a negative influence on this development, corporate bond issuance continued nevertheless to grow at a relatively robust pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">One explanation, among others, for this development is the role played by e-finance in securities markets – especially on the retail side, where online trading has quickly taken large market shares.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">On average, almost one-quarter of brokerage services are now provided online in the euro area; whereas the figure in the United States is about 50%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">But in some emerging countries, the figure is even higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">The rapid acceptance of e-finance in securities markets reflects the technology-driven nature of these markets and the ease with which consumers can switch between brokers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The spread of e-broking in retail markets has markedly reduced transaction costs, which has been a factor in encouraging more small investors to invest directly in the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In the euro area, the development of the private bond market implies that there has been an increase in the options available to borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">At the same time, changes in the financial structure – towards more securitisation – are likely to increase the importance of wealth effects of monetary policy, as households and non-financial corporations will probably hold a larger share of their wealth in the form of financial market instruments, such as corporate bonds or equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.64,0)">An increase in new forms of finance or new products leading to disintermediation could also have a significant impact on the way that monetary policy influences the cost of financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.56,0)">For example, securitisation can affect the way in which monetary policy influences bank lending behaviour and might potentially reduce the role of bank lending in the monetary transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Securitisation also leads to more market-based finance and, given that markets sometimes react more quickly to changes in monetary policy than banks, this could even strengthen the efficiency of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.75,0)">Therefore, the question raised by financial innovation appears not to be a loss of effectiveness of monetary policy, but rather the impact that it may have on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This again calls for close monitoring of the transmission mechanism by central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.49,0)">However, for the time being, the possibility of financial innovation affecting the monetary transmission mechanism in the euro area looks quite remote.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Even if there is evidence suggesting that securitisation is growing in popularity in the euro area, the European market is still not highly developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Conclusion All in all, financial innovation can help to increase the efficiency of the financial system, which facilitates the operation of monetary policy, but at the same time complicates the environment in which monetary policy operates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">To deal with this complexity, central banks need to respond by monitoring the financial landscape, by following developments closely and by trying to predict the consequences of innovations that, at first, may appear very marginal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">The ECB's monetary policy strategy is well designed to deal with these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Although it gives a prominent role to money, it also takes into account possible influences of financial innovation on monetary aggregates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Furthermore, through its examination of non-monetary indicators, including both real and financial variables, the information from monetary aggregates can be cross-checked, which makes monetary policy more robust and less dependent on single indicators that may become distorted by financial innovation.</span>
