    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)"> The euro, monetary policy and reforms Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,on receiving an honorary degree in political science, LUISS “Guido Carli” University, Rome, 6 May 2013 My first grateful and fond mention goes to Guido Carli.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">My gratitude goes to the university that bears his name, to its Rector, Professor Massimo Egidi, to its Senatus Academicus, which has honoured me with this title, and to Professor Messori for his kind words, as well as to the entire academic body of this university.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.3,0)">The origins of the crisis in the euro area Until a few years ago monetary policy was considered a textbook discipline, almost a mechanical skill involving the implementation of computational applications by conscientious experts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In the period known as the Great Moderation, from the middle of the 1980s to the beginning of the global financial crisis, inflation had been brought under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Macroeconomic volatility was contained and this was a source of great pride for all central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Some foresaw a future of genteel and honourable oblivion for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.29,0)">This is no longer the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The experience of the first five years following the crisis shows that all central banks have adjusted their monetary policies along hitherto unexplored lines: some have been abandoned and no new paradigm has yet been formulated, the wish is to put an end to the emergency and return to normality where the rules are based on a well-established discipline of long standing, but it is not known with any certainty what reality will emerge in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Furthermore, although the precise shape of monetary policy has always been influenced by the respective institutional and historical context – consider the varying “mandates” of the central banks – the various forms that the crisis took in different parts of the world reinforced this correspondence between the specific institutional and financial contexts and the monetary policies pursued in them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In the euro area, the extraordinary success of the single currency concealed for years the risks that were building up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.35,0)">The governments of the Member States considered themselves free from previous constraints: with the exception of Germany and a few other countries, they delayed structural reforms that could have redressed the competitiveness of obsolete economic structures to meet the challenges of relentless globalisation; they undermined the limits introduced in the Stability and Growth Pact, jeopardising their own credibility as partners in a Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In the years preceding the crisis, this Union began to divide countries with positive trade balances and sound budgets from those with growing budget deficits and external deficits financed by private credit flows increasingly sourced from the first group of countries and not used for investments to increase competitiveness, but rather to finance unproductive spending, or property bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.06,0)">No one ever imagined that the Monetary Union could become a union divided between permanent creditors and permanent debtors, where the former would perpetually lend money and credibility to the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">A profound change in the governance of the Union became necessary, with new rules whereby the solidarity clamoured for had as its counterpart the transfer of national powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.96,0)">But this too was delayed and its urgency was downplayed in the face of the requirements of a purported national sovereignty which was in reality weakened by globalisation and growing levels of public debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.46,0)">The global financial crisis, which swiftly and dramatically increased market perceptions of risk, rudely awakened all the actors from this long, complacent amnesia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.27,0)">The external deficits, budget deficits and levels of public debt of the countries in the second group fast became unsustainable once they were no longer financed externally and in particular by the rest of the Union, the inadequate governance of which was then laid bare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.31,0)">This brief scrutiny of the origins of the crisis in the euro area shows how the response of economic policy cannot be other than composite: in it, monetary policy plays an important but by no means exclusive role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.38,0)">The crisis and the ECB’s monetary policy The epicentre of the crisis in the initial phase was liquidity, an economic measure that had been neglected by the theory for many years since a lack thereof seemed so unlikely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.41,0)">The day after Lehman Brothers collapsed, the money markets stopped functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.61,0)">The liquidity required by banks to refinance their maturing assets suddenly became extremely scarce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Generally speaking, banks borrow at short-term or very short-term from savers with a strong preference for the immediate availability of funds, or for “liquidity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.05,0)">If savers suddenly refuse to roll over their deposits with the banks, the banks then attempt to discontinue the credit that they supply to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">If this is not possible owing to long maturities, banks seek to liquidate first of all those assets in their portfolio that are traded on the market at known and verifiable exchange prices, in an effort to avoid insolvency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.01,0)">But a sudden financial retreat by many financial institutions simultaneously cannot occur without generalised financial suffering, and without banks incurring substantial capital losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.3,0)">Asset prices fall rapidly and bank capital declines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.01,0)">The interbank markets dry up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.67,0)">The economy loses an indispensable mechanism for generating income and allocating resources, namely the intermediation of savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.22,0)">In a second phase beginning in 2011, the lack of credit to the more vulnerable sovereign issuers became the centre point of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.76,0)">The euro area governments responded with actions that, while individually effective, revealed the political unsustainability of a Union in which the countries that pay and the countries that receive are always the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.08,0)">Sovereign debt in the euro area is no longer risk-free: it depends on the sovereign and the quality of its policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This process, beneficial in and of itself, revolutionised the risk structure on which the functioning of the European financial markets was based for so many years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.94,0)">In addition, without a single Union government and economic policy, it led to an abnormal increase in risk premia, which reached systemic proportions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.52,0)">Premia were no longer based on the creditworthiness of borrowers, which was admittedly shaky for reasons already mentioned, but rather could only be explained by the manifestation of expectations regarding the end of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.18,0)">Risk premia and non-standard measures But what are risk premia?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The compensation required on a long-term financial contract must be at least equal to what could be obtained with a short-term contract that is continuously renewed until the end of the term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Long-term investors require a return that, at the very least, establishes financial equivalence between the two strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.49,0)">But, in general, equivalence is not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.67,0)">Creditors expect additional compensation for the risks they take on relating to not being paid back promptly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These risks are varied and the markets attach a price – or risk premium – to each one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The pure risk relating to postponing the availability of capital for a period of time is compensated by a term risk premium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">The risk that a creditor is forced to liquidate a long-term financial investment before maturity in difficult market circumstances is compensated by a liquidity risk premium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Finally, the risk that the borrower does not meet his/her repayment obligations at the end of the contractually-agreed term is compensated by a credit risk premium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.99,0)">In a period of deep financial crisis, the increase in all risk premia is, as I mentioned, out of proportion because market participants are no longer willing or able to bear them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.23,0)">The non-standard measures adopted by the central banks in the larger countries in the five years since the start of the financial crisis can be identified according to the type of risk premia they were intended to tackle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.53,0)">For example, the large-scale purchasing of assets, or quantitative easing, carried out by the Federal Reserve System affects the term risk premium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The main aim of quantitative easing is to reabsorb the quantity of term risk held in the economy as a whole and thereby compress its price – the corresponding risk premium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The ECB initially adopted non-standard measures primarily aimed at cutting the financial premium linked to liquidity risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.31,0)">At the dawn of the crisis, shortly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the liquidity risk in the interbank market shook to its foundations the very structure of the payment system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">This catastrophic risk led to an exceptional reassessment of the liquidity risk premium on credit between transactors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.4,0)">In this context, the ECB took the place of the interbank market, which had cut off its supply of short-term and very short-term credit to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The ECB subsequently changed its own instrument for providing banks with liquidity, adopting a system whereby it supplied unlimited credit at a fixed interest rate – known as the fixed rate full allotment policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In this way, the ECB allowed banks to refinance their assets using its own credit, rather than through asset fire sales in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.27,0)">A situation in which sound and solvent banks became insolvent was thus avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In order to reassure banks that access to central bank liquidity would indeed be extended in line with their refinancing needs in the medium term, we extended the maturity of our credit lending from the standard three months pre-crisis, to six months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, to one year by mid-2009 and, finally, to three years at the end of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.91,0)">From the second half of 2011, we witnessed the emergence of a new source of stress, which has been defined as the risk of “redenomination”, resulting from the potential exit of a country from the euro or even from the potential collapse of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.66,0)">A particular form of credit risk premium was associated with these possibilities, which was unrelated to the assessment of a borrower’s solvency but which, in fact, came about owing to unfounded concerns regarding a systemic breakdown in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">The ECB therefore launched the OMTs  , a monetary policy instrument aimed at eliminating the financial risk premium caused by this specific systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">OMTs allow the ECB to buy sovereign bonds with a remaining maturity of up to three years in the secondary market, where necessary in order to remove the risk of “redenomination”   from the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The bond-issuing governments which request the activation of OMTs agree, in conjunction with the European authorities and, if possible, with the International Monetary Fund, on a recovery programme to address macroeconomic and structural weaknesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.38,0)">This is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition as the ECB has full discretion to decide on the start, continuation or suspension of OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Furthermore, the excess liquidity created by these purchases will be reabsorbed by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">The conditionality associated with the programme to which governments and the European authorities agree is a crucial element in being able to preserve monetary policy independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">It is important in providing the ECB with adequate assurance that interventions supporting sovereign debt bond prices do not mutate into financial subsidies for unsustainable national policies in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.03,0)">By way of drawing a parallel between OMTs and our standard liquidity operations: as the credit provided to banking counterparties cannot be, and must not be, interpreted as an injection of capital into failing banks; in the same vein, under OMTs, in compressing the premium for the risk of “redenomination”, the ECB cannot and does not intend to provide financial support to governments which reinstate solvency conditions which have not already been approved ex ante.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In both cases, the ECB’s non-standard measures were triggered by the need to restore the functioning of monetary policy transmission channels, first by reducing liquidity premia and then by reducing the redenomination risk premium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.82,0)">Diverging financing conditions in the euro area Throughout the two phases of the crisis – the banking crisis and the sovereign debt crisis – our approach to liquidity provision was elastic, with adjustments made in response to demand for support from banks more severely affected by market pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">At first, this demand was widespread across large parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.05,0)">In 2008 and 2009, those banks more exposed to sectors and activities under stress were ostracised by the market, no matter where they were based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.64,0)">Then, in the second phase of the crisis, the obstacles to liquidity provision became linked to territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.12,0)">The banking sector and financial market in the euro area gradually fragmented along national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">These borders separate banking sectors which, irrespective of the intrinsic quality of their intermediaries, are considered robust, because the country in which they are based is able to cope with a banking crisis, from those considered to be fragile, where the markets consider this capacity to be lacking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These borders thus separate countries that are competitive and have sound balance sheets from those characterised by fragile balance sheets and a lack of capacity for growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">The measures decided on by the ECB   helped to overcome, to a large extent, this fragmentation that characterised the funding of the banking system until mid-2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.8,0)">The dispersion in the growth rate of bank deposits has now returned to 2007 levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.37,0)">Progress on the lending front has been much slower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In the first group of countries, we are generally seeing normal or accommodative financing conditions for firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.99,0)">In the second group, we are seeing a persistent tightening of credit, possibly decreasing in intensity in some countries, with retail bank loan rates that are much higher than those applied by banks located in the first group of countries and more stringent collateral requirements for loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">The ECB’s recently published “Survey on the access to finance of SMEs in the euro area”   provides a clear picture of the difficulties this sector, so crucial for the euro area economy, finds itself in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.92,0)">Among the principal causes for concern cited by the SMEs interviewed, access to credit was second only to the difficulties encountered in finding customers for their products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.43,0)">The obstacles to obtaining credit   persist, and represent one of the main factors of heterogeneity between countries in the euro area, though they are not confined to those countries under stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.16,0)">In fact, in addition to SMEs in Greece, Ireland and Spain, a large number of SMEs operating in The Netherlands are encountering significant obstacles  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">These figures reflect the considerable heterogeneity in borrowing conditions, as also shown by the most recent bank lending survey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.6,0)">This fragmentation is all the more troublesome in an economy such as that of the euro area, in which financial intermediation is bank-based for at least three-quarters of firms’ financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.49,0)">And it penalises all the more those enterprises, often of a small or medium size, which depend more heavily on the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.64,0)">This is particularly serious considering that this sector employs around two-thirds of workers in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.44,0)">Banks are not lending for a number of reasons: lack of funding, investment alternatives, lack of capital, risk aversion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The ECB has done a great deal on the first two fronts, providing liquidity and reducing the redenomination risk premium on government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We cannot subsidise governments by buying their bonds, and we cannot subsidise bank shareholders by removing the need for them to strengthen their balance sheets by means of necessary recapitalisation measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">We can do little directly to reduce the risk aversion which is holding back bank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.18,0)">In other financial systems, a large share of credit is transmitted to the economy via capital markets; financial assets are traded on the basis of known, verifiable prices and are often subject to ratings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">A central bank that wished to try to reduce the risk premia on such assets would not face great operational obstacles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.27,0)">In the euro area, the capital market is much smaller, and a central bank that wished to intervene would have to purchase from the banking system the loans the latter had made to the economy, for which there is only a very limited market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.51,0)">This would be a very complex undertaking, even without taking into account the institutional context which would necessarily involve intervention in 17 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">But the ECB has taken a number of measures on this front too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Banks have for some time been able to use credit claims as collateral when obtaining funding from the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And we should not underestimate the effectiveness of traditional monetary policy when general conditions change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.78,0)">As mentioned, the Governing Council of the ECB cut interest rates to 0.5% at its last meeting, bringing them to a historic low after eight months in which they had been unchanged at 0.75%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.71,0)">This is because macroeconomic weakness is now also affecting parts of the euro area in which the transmission of monetary policy had never been an issue, and also because we are seeing some signs that fragmentation is receding with regard to lending in some of the euro area countries experiencing stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">In this regard, national measures can also be effective, as already put into practice in some countries, with the involvement of governments, public banks and development agencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The ECB has launched initiatives with the EIB and the European Commission with the aim of reducing the fragmentation of lending in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">We must not forget the extraordinary progress made on this front by the European Council in bringing together the national supervisory systems in a single European mechanism – the management of which has been assigned to the ECB – and in creating a European mechanism for the resolution of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">These initiatives will go the furthest in breaking the link between banks and sovereign debt which is behind the current fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.98,0)">But we should not forget that growth is currently weaker in some countries than in others, and not just because credit is scarce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.25,0)">It was weaker even before the crisis, notwithstanding often turbulent growth in public spending, because structural weaknesses were not tackled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In the wake of the crisis, the burden of this failure is now being felt by all of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Structural reforms for growth and more solidarity in society The reforms aim to untie the knots that curb competitiveness and suffocate growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Effective promotion and safeguarding of competition; an adequate degree of flexibility in the labour market that is properly distributed across the generations; the cutting of government red tape that is an obstacle to growth; human capital that is equipped to face the challenges posed by global competition; and a better environment – these are all fronts on which, despite recent progress, much remains to be done, albeit to varying degrees across individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Fiscal policies must follow a sustainable path, separate and distinct from cyclical fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Without this prerequisite, lasting growth is not possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Particularly for countries with structurally high levels of public debt, rather than temporarily high levels as a result of the current crisis, this means not slipping back from the goals already achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.25,0)">Let us not forget that, in an institutional context in which the solvency of sovereign states is no longer an established fact and the governance of the Union is still incomplete, when a country’s public finances lack credibility its banks are quickly cut off from the rest of the euro financial market in the absence of private sector credit in that country: this is what we are now seeing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">However, to mitigate the inevitable recessionary effects of fiscal consolidation, the composition of such measures must favour the reduction of current public spending and of taxes, particularly in a context such as in Europe where taxation is already high by international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">There is no doubt that lasting growth is essential for reducing unemployment, particularly among young people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.86,0)">In some European countries youth unemployment has reached levels that damage people’s faith in prospects for a decent life and which risk giving rise to extreme and destructive forms of protest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Output growth was essential for the success of the European social model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The extraordinary economic growth during the so-called “Golden Age” – namely the thirty years that followed the Second World War – allowed a significant improvement in the material wealth of a large portion of the European population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">At the same time, this wealth strengthened the growth process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.89,0)">At that time the foundations were laid in Europe for modern welfare systems aimed at protecting individuals against the risk that unemployment, illness or old age could lead to a deterioration in their living standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It is in part thanks to these instruments that the financial crisis and the recession have not had the same devastating social effects as the Great Depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.44,0)">Many years ago Rudi Dornbusch said, exaggerating rather, that Europeans were so rich they could afford to pay everybody for not working.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.52,0)">This is no longer the case, but we do not wish to lose the solidarity which inspired that model in such very different times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Therefore, today we must adapt that model in line with the changes that demographic dynamics and the new environment of global competition demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This must be done to reduce youth unemployment, increase consumption and preserve the very essence of welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Another aspect of growth sustainability, in a European context, that I would like to draw your attention to today is that of income distribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">For almost twenty years there has been a trend towards a higher concentration of family income in Europe to the detriment of the poorest households, as statistics published by Eurostat show.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">A more equal share in the fruits of the production of national wealth helps foster a culture of saving and, therefore, of collective involvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">A sense of being an integral part of a country and of having a stake in its economic future strengthens social cohesion and encourages individual economic behaviour that leads, in the aggregate, to economic prosperity for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">There are a number of tools governments can use to achieve this aim, but first of all social cohesion must be sought by removing the barriers which limit individuals’ opportunity to pursue their goals and which allow family background to dictate life choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In eliminating vested interests in a non-competitive system, structural reforms are more than just a tool for growth creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">By encouraging everyone to be involved in the process of production, they ensure that the drive for a more equal income allocation is not the task of state-led redistribution alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">In this way, reforms aim to harness individual potential to the growth of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Nevertheless, looking to the not-too-distant future, national virtues – while indispensable for strengthening solidarity among Member States along the way – won’t be enough to make Europe a goal all its citizens can consider their own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">It will also be necessary to introduce reforms that further reduce the barriers between individual Member States, in particular to the development of a single European labour market, and that affirm the principle of solidarity, as proposed recently in the “Four Presidents’ Report”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">To build, with passion and vigour, a shared future in which the conditions for growth are more favourable, in which all citizens feel that their skills are fully valued, in which individual well-being goes hand in hand with collective well-being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">We are all working today, each within our own mandate, to achieve that goal.</span>
