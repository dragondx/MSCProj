    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.09,0)"> The global monetary policy stance: what are the risks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.48,0)">Speech by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBBruegel Annual MeetingBrussels, 10 September 2013 Dear Chairman, dear Ladies and Gentlemen, The recent years have been challenging for monetary policy makers around the world, including in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.71,0)">The economic and financial crisis that broke out in late 2008 turned central banks into “unconventional” market players and forced them to be creative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Since 2007, central banks have adopted a wide range of unconventional policies to repair the transmission mechanism and provide additional accommodation at the zero lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.52,0)">These policies have been different across economic areas and depended on central banks’ operational frameworks, mandates and country specific challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Within our mandate, we at the ECB, at the be-ginning under the leadership of Jean-Claude Trichet, acted strongly to prevent a credit crunch and reduce financial fragmentation in the euro area: We provided unlimited liquidity to banks, extending the maturity of our operations to 3 years, and allowed our collateral rules to adjust to the new environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">These measures prevented a more severe contraction in credit and reduced divergences across countries caused by bank funding risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We introduced the Outright Monetary Transactions   to remove financial fragmentation caused by currency redenomination risks that had surfaced due to unfounded fears of a euro break up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The OMT has calmed markets leading to significantly improved financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.55,0)">As a result, Target 2 imbalances have declined by 1/3 since their peak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Let me also say that the OMT is a policy for the euro area as whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">By reducing financial fragmentation, the OMT contributed to the normalisation of those yields that were excessively compressed by market fears.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">While unconventional monetary policy actions were necessary, we also need to pay attention to the related risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me briefly discuss them together with broader challenges for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.99,0)">One risk is complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Monetary policy can only gain time for other policy makers to tackle structural problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This is particularly important in Europe where governments need to continue implementing structural reforms to boost growth potential and employment, especially among the youth, to consolidate public finances, and to strengthen domestic banking systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.09,0)">Another risk relates to the side effects of globally low yields, which has already been widely debated in international fora.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Risks of capital misallocations, stemming from low risk premia and yields, are not confined to domestic economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Large capital flows moved to emerging markets searching for yield.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">As Christine Lagarde recently recalled at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium, since 2008, cumulative net flows to emerging markets have risen by $1.1 trillion, which is large from an historical point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.58,0)">A third risk relates to exit strategies from monetary accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Exit risks are now taking centre stage in the debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.9,0)">On this front, I would like to recall a similar episode from which we can draw some lessons: the 1994 exit of the Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.4,0)">In early 1994, when the US recovery gained strength, the Fed started a tightening cycle and bond markets crashed not only in the US but al-so around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">If spill-overs were large in 1994, we can expect them to be even larger to-day in an even more deeply interconnected world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.18,0)">One striking feature of the 1994 bond market crash is that yields actually overreacted to macroeconomic news, while they did not react strongly to Fed interest rate hikes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.7,0)">For example, 8 of the 10 largest daily in-creases in the 10 year US Treasury yields in 1994 were related to the release of better than expected economic data.. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that inflation fears contributed to the spike in yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.81,0)">Indeed, in 1994, the political pressure on the Fed to slow the tightening cycle was high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">All Reserve Bank Presidents were invited to explain their views before the House and Senate banking committees, which was unprecedented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.07,0)">According to commentators, this public dispute damaged the credibility of the Fed, contributing to the inflation scare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">In my view, two important lessons seem to emerge from the 1994 episode: First: Clarity regarding central banks’ “reaction functions” is crucial to avoid sharp movements in yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.11,0)">This is because the impact of economic developments on yields depends on markets’ expectations on how the central banks will react.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.69,0)">Second: Inflation fears amplify the impact of economic developments on yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">There-fore, it is important that inflation expectations remain well anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">While central banking and the functioning of capital markets have changed since and new challenges and complexities have emerged, the lessons from the 1994 episode remain valid and might help in addressing these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.76,0)">The first challenge is that monetary policy is currently in unchartered territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.92,0)">Policy choices of central banks are not any more limited to the single interest rate instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.44,0)">As a consequence, communicating exit strategies is more complex than in previous tightening cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">At the ECB, the exit is made easier by the policy instruments used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Security holdings of the SMP will be held until maturity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.3,0)">Excess liquidity is sterilised with reverse operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Banks can pay back long term loans before maturity as market conditions normalise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">At the same time, the ECB remains ready to act if conditions deteriorate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.36,0)">The new role of central banks in preserving financial stability is another challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Following the crisis, the prevailing view suggested to as-sign new powers to central banks, in the form of stronger involvement in bank supervision and macro-prudential policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.39,0)">Some observers argue that conflicts between financial stability functions and the primary goal of preserving price stability might emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To safeguard the credibility of the monetary policy function and of the supervisory function we will adopt a governance structure that strictly separates the two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And the hierarchy of goals is clearly set and communicated at the ECB: our primary objective is and will remain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.74,0)">For example, a central bank might find itself in a difficult situation if an interest rate hike necessary to avert risks to price stability would at the same time impact adversely on some banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.4,0)">Allegedly, this could undermine the credibility of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In this context, communicating clearly and designing appropriate institutional frameworks is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">We in Europe are very much aware of these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">At ECB, the preparation of the single supervisory mechanism   is progressing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The asset quality review of banks to be carried out before the SSM becomes operational will ensure that “hot potatoes” will not be handed over to the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">To complement the institutional architecture, we also need a strong commitment towards an effective Single Resolution Mechanism, along with efficient and credible backstops.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The latter two elements are a necessary complement to the SSM and will ultimately increase its credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.39,0)">Finally, threats to credibility and independence might also make the job of central bankers more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Central banks have fulfilled their man-dates and proven successful through their measures and interventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">As a result of the earned credibility, politicians and the general public have now higher expectations as to central banks’ ability to manage crisis and the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.15,0)">This might overburden central banks and make them more involved in sensitive areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">The new challenges and complexities of today’s environment make clear that communication strategies will play an increasingly important role in the dialogue between central banks and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In this regard, I want to conclude by mentioning two recent developments at the ECB: The first one is forward guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Forward guidance is central bank communication about future policy intentions, not a new monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It involves two elements of communication: an assessment of the central bank’s view of the future, and in-formation on how the central bank may act in response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.96,0)">In July, the Governing Council announced that it expects the key ECB interest rates to remain low for an extended period of time, on the basis of the outlook for inflation and against the background of economic weak-ness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The ECB’s forward guidance is a pronouncement to reassert and clarify the strategy of the ECB and its assessment of the state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">In our case the forward guidance is geared to reach two objectives: to reduce the volatility in the corridor, in which we have succeeded so far, and to make sure that economic data do not cause overreactions in the market interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">On this ground we have been moderately successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">It is still early days and it remains to be seen how this evolves in an environment of improving economic data and a generalised increase in global long-term rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.53,0)">The second one is the discussion regarding the publication of the minutes of Governing Council meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The increasing role of central banks in crisis and economic management requires greater accountability, which calls for more transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The Governing Council is evaluating how to enrich the communication strategy of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">I believe that publishing the minutes of Governing Council meetings would be an important element of a richer communication strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In my personal view the minutes, summarising the main policy discussions, should include who voted for what, and the reasoning behind that vote.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.66,0)">Publishing the minutes in such a way will sharpen our mandate, because the ECB will then have to explain why its decisions are in line with its European mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.52,0)">One should not overestimate the risk that pressure is exercised of members of the Governing Council, especially governors of national central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">In my view someone who takes up such a position should be able to withstand such pressure.</span>
