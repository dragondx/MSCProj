    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.99,0)"> Lessons for monetary policy from the recent crisis Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the roundtable “L’euro e la crisi internazionale” organised by University of Chicago Alumni Club of Italy and Bocconi Alumni Association, Milan, 19 January 2011 Introduction The financial crisis has been a very challenging period for policy-makers worldwide, not least for monetary authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.78,0)">Central banks have lowered interest rates to levels close to zero and implemented a broad range of unprecedented non-standard policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The recent experience offers, I think, five lessons from which monetary policy-makers can learn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me list them upfront, before turning to each of them – in that order – in my remarks today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Central bank independence remains critical to delivering price stability, particularly during crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">A clearly defined objective of price stability is essential to firmly anchor inflation expectations, which can act as an automatic stabiliser during a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Monetary policy should be oriented to the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.55,0)">Trying to fine-tune monetary policy on the basis of indicators, such as output gaps and measures of core inflation, which are either subject to ex post revisions or are misleading, may – and often does – induce an excess short-termism and entail serious risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Monetary and financial variables should be a key input in the assessment of medium to long-run risks to price stability, particularly during financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Finally, price stability and financial stability are complementary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The new macro-prudential function and monetary policy reinforce each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Central bank independence remains critical The value of central bank independence is the first, lasting lesson.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Of course, central bank independence is a sine qua non of effective monetary policy, at all times and under all possible circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">If a central bank is not independent, policy-makers from other quarters have strong incentives to pass on to the bank problems and responsibilities for which they, in fact, are to be held accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.55,0)">This – always – leads to a blurring of responsibilities and potentially to a loss of trust, which ultimately undermines the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">But in times of crisis the value of independence rises even further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.36,0)">In perturbed market conditions central banks may have to implement extraordinary measures, both in terms of reducing policy rates to unprecedented levels, and in terms of unconventional liquidity measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.77,0)">If these measures – untested as they are – are to be expected to exert any impact on economic decisions, they have to be seen by market participants as the result of an autonomous decision by the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">They ought to be seen as being consistent with its overall policy framework, rather than the result of pressures from the fiscal authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The reason is simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.21,0)">If a central bank comes under pressure in times of crisis, and succumbs to that pressure, it is unlikely to behave differently in good times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.61,0)">Therefore, if the central bank is externally constrained to take exceptional measures during a crisis, it will not be able to resist the same pressures when the crisis ends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.42,0)">This may disanchor inflation expectations and thus undermine the effectiveness of the measures implemented during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.5,0)">The ECB has made no exception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.44,0)">The financial crisis that has shaken the global economy for two full years has meant that we had to explore new avenues of monetary policy intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.22,0)">We all had to experiment with new tools, as conventional instruments had been blunted and damaged to some extent by the financial collapse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">True, the activation of new tools sometimes has brought us closer to the lines that separate the different spheres of policy-making responsibilities from each other – lines we previously considered as remote.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.08,0)">However, the fact that during a crisis the central bank broadens its range of tools does not imply that it is compromising its objective and its independence in pursuit of its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In the case of the ECB, the institutional framework for the single monetary policy establishes the ECB’s independence in choosing the instruments necessary to achieve its mandate of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.29,0)">We cannot modify our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">But we can choose the instruments which, from time to time, we consider most efficient in attaining our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This is the essence of “instrument independence”, a fundamental cornerstone of the contemporary theory and practice of central banking, and a critical precondition for central banks’ success in taming inflation and keeping it low and stable over the last 30 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Because of the crucial role of banks in the real economy of the euro area, in the autumn of 2008 we started to provide liquidity in unlimited volumes and with longer maturities to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">In June 2009 we launched a programme to purchase euro-denominated covered bonds issued by euro area resident banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">The aim was to jump-start this market, which represents the bright side of securitisation, and yet had suffered considerably in the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.2,0)">By May 2010 persistent and excessive government borrowing and accounting frauds had unleashed a debt run on Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.49,0)">Market uncertainties had spread to other issuers and a localised loss of confidence had soon developed into a generalised market paralysis: a virtual seizing-up of the market for government paper, for any signature except the most credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">In these conditions, the ECB decided to intervene again, through a new Securities Markets Programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The purpose of these interventions was – and still is – genuinely a monetary policy one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The market for government paper plays a central role in the financial system of any developed economy, and constitutes a crucial link in the upstream portion of the transmission mechanism that channels monetary policy impulses to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is due to the power of collateral in the contemporary financial world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.59,0)">The presence or absence of collateral in money market transactions, and the quality of the collateral used to secure money market transactions determine whether the transmission mechanism starts to function or is blocked, whether it is foreseeable and dependable, or uncertain and unreliable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.24,0)">The perceived quality of collateral influences the scale of market spreads over and above the overnight rate at which the central bank lends to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And money market spreads are the first asset prices whose orderly adjustment is so important in ensuring that the monetary policy intentions of a central bank are conveyed to the broad economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In addition, one should not neglect the fact that government securities provide the basis on which all private debt instruments are priced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">I would take the argument one step further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">I suggest that the central bank should use its independence to remind the other main policy actors at all times, even during crises, of their responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.53,0)">It should not act in a way which may create disincentives for the other authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The fiscal and supervisory authorities are key players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">When implementing an accommodative policy in response to a potential seizing-up of financial markets, the central bank should not shy away from calling on the fiscal authority to implement a credible medium-term budgetary adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I would even consider this to be a pre-condition for the central bank to enact such a policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.6,0)">Otherwise the uncertainties surrounding the fiscal framework may contaminate monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">On a more general note, an accommodative liquidity policy entailing atypically low interest rates needs reinforcing safeguards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">On the one hand, it needs to be accompanied by a healthy fiscal framework: such a framework removes one prime source of instability and – where instability persists nonetheless – it broadens the scope of action open to central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">This has been a key point for the ECB especially over the last 12 months and will continue to be in 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">We have emphasised several times that it is the task of the political authorities to ensure a credible fiscal framework, composed of appropriate national budgetary programmes, a rigorous surveillance framework at the euro area level and a stable safety net underpinning the stability of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The ECB has also repeatedly called on the governments of the Member States to make a leap forward in improving the institutional framework underlying the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">We have made concrete proposals over the last few months on ways to improve the fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance underlying the Stability and Growth Pact and to address crises, if they occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">A lot has been done but there is a need to complete this work, as we have stated recently, to protect the system against market instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">We have also repeatedly called for a timely consolidation of public finances, in contrast to some commentators and academics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Had this consolidation started earlier, rather than under the pressure of the markets, it would have been less painful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.64,0)">The same pressure needs to be exerted on the supervisory and fiscal authorities in charge of ensuring the solvency of financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.28,0)">An unconditional supply of liquidity by the central bank to address systemic problems may create disincentives to recapitalise and restructure the fragile parts of the system, and thus delay the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">The provision of liquidity should thus be conducted in a way that maintains the incentives for financial institutions and supervisors to take all the necessary measures to restore normality as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This is why extraordinary measures have to be implemented within a framework which foresees a timely exit when conditions allow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">A clearly defined objective of price stability is essential The second lesson taught by the crisis is that a clearly defined objective of price stability can act as an automatic stabiliser when uncertainty becomes destabilising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is always true, in both good times and bad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">In fact, well-anchored expectations in the euro area were instrumental in avoiding large interest rate hikes before the crisis, when commodity prices rose sharply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.97,0)">At the height of the crisis, however, they became a policy instrument in their own right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Thanks to well-anchored inflation expectations we were able to avoid deflationary spirals and reduce real interest rates in tandem with nominal rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">e. no need to increase the inflation target or to move to price level targeting in order to resist deflationary risks in times of macroeconomic distress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.23,0)">Opportunistic manipulations of the monetary policy framework of course damage the foundations on which that framework rests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">So, being able to rely on the rebalancing effect of inflation expectations is a superior option.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.83,0)">But firmly anchored inflation expectations also make policy commitments unnecessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">These commitments concerning the future course of the policy rate are viewed as providing one effective instrument for introducing a stimulus when the room for reducing the nominal interest rate is exhausted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.88,0)">But they come at a price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.54,0)">Policy commitments cannot be effective unless they materially constrain future options.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Again, being able to rely on firm inflation expectations offers a way to reduce real rates and provide a stimulus without incurring the limitations of policy commitments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Monetary policy should be oriented to the medium term The third lesson concerns the risks associated with a monetary policy aimed at fine-tuning short-term objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.77,0)">Experience, especially prior to the crisis, has revealed the risks of designing policy on indicators and variables which are not sufficiently robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.19,0)">Let me give a couple of examples, starting with the output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.08,0)">As the literature has clearly shown, the empirical proxies used to capture the output gap are subject to constant revisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.85,0)">There is evidence that for the period 2002-2004 the output gap estimates in the United States were ex post significantly smaller than the real-time estimates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.57,0)">Policy-makers who base their decisions mainly on such assessments of the cyclical position can be seriously led astray.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.67,0)">The Great Inflation of the 1970s was, for instance, to a large extent due to measurement errors in the real-time estimates of the output gap combined with an overreaction to output gap measures when assessing the state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The same applies to the low interest rates implemented for a prolonged period in the middle of the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.97,0)">Core inflation measures are another example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.33,0)">These can give misleading signals in the event of persistent changes to relative prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is not so much a lesson that we can learn from the crisis, but a phenomenon that the crisis has exposed as one of the main factors of the pre-crisis Great Moderation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.17,0)">Examples abound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.05,0)">For example, technological innovations concentrated in the production of the goods included in the core inflation basket can persistently push down selected prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.67,0)">There is also evidence that globalisation has been depressing prices for core CPI products due to increased global competition in the tradable goods sector  , while at the same time prices for energy and food products have been pushed up by the demand of those emerging economies that were opening up to the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.81,0)">In these conditions, too much emphasis on core inflation can distort policy inference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Core inflation can provide policy-makers with a downwardly biased assessment of overall price pressures and – mistakenly – suggest a pro-cyclical policy course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.14,0)">In a globalised world, the destabilising mechanisms that such distortions of perspective can activate are manifold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Today increased trade and capital flows make monetary policy decisions in systemically important countries tightly interact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In fact, monetary policy decisions in industrialised countries find in the exchange rate arrangements of important emerging market economies a potentially potent multiplier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">For example, the currently accommodative monetary policy of industrialised countries generates more liquidity at the global level than if emerging market economies’ currencies were free to float.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.86,0)">Limits to the sterilisation of international capital inflows under currency pegs lead to generalised liquidity spillovers on a global scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.98,0)">At the same time the accumulation of foreign reserves by emerging market economies leads to downward pressure on long-term interest rates in global economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.94,0)">This, in turn, intensifies the trends in asset and commodity prices, thus potentially leading to further imbalances and global inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">When setting their policies, monetary policy-makers in industrialised countries should take this dimension into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.18,0)">Monetary policies aimed at fine-tuning short-term objectives also run a serious risk that they will induce too much policy forbearance for too long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.52,0)">Exiting an extraordinarily accommodative mode too late can sow the seeds of future imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.95,0)">As the economy recovers from an exceptionally deep recession, real-time output gap estimates and estimates of structural unemployment or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment   are particularly uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.48,0)">Structural unemployment is likely to have significantly risen because of the mismatch between the skills of workers that lose their jobs in sectors that are downsizing, and the skills of workers required in the expanding sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.84,0)">While emphasis on output gap measures can instil the conviction that unemployment could be reduced by monetary means, it becomes an illusion if the problem is due to a structural mismatch of skills or labour market imperfections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.03,0)">Structural policies are the only policy instrument that can address structural unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Monetary and financial variables are a key input in the assessment of price stability The fourth lesson that I draw from these difficult times is that this crisis has certainly proved that the conventional wisdom of the last decade – that money does not matter, even for monetary policy – is wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I guess I do not need to emphasise this to alumni from the University of Chicago!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Money and credit aggregates do contain important information that allows policy-makers to overcome the pitfalls related to some economic indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.69,0)">When inflation is rendered dormant by a sequence of favourable supply side shocks, this creates an environment in which central banks might find it extremely difficult to raise interest rates, even if such a response were justified by bullish financial markets and by signs of economic overheating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In these conditions, incorporating monetary and financial imbalances in the policy process – whether in the form of a monetary pillar or in the form of a leaning-against-the-wind attitude – can help support a pre-emptive policy even in the face of subdued or falling inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The reason is simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.7,0)">Monetary and credit imbalances which form alongside and – I would say – in symbiosis with an asset price trend indicate that price stability might be endangered over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Reacting to the monetary side of this symbiosis may prevent larger problems from occurring subsequently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In addition, monitoring credit growth can also be useful to identify other sources of unsustainable credit developments, even if some of them cannot necessarily be eliminated by monetary policy tools, and would instead require action of a macro-prudential nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">After years of forgetfulness, macroeconomic theory seems to have caught up with reality and shifted attention to credit and leverage as critical parameters that a central bank should consult regularly to measure the pulse of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.17,0)">The ECB consistently used these parameters even when they were derided as relics of a defunct monetary doctrine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">They proved useful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.98,0)">They gave information about financing conditions and the financial structure, as well as about the condition and behaviour of banks, when these sources of information were critical to the assessment of the health of the transmission mechanism and, more broadly, the state of the business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">And this dimension of monetary analysis has proved particularly valuable in shaping the ECB’s response to the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.56,0)">There is indeed evidence for the euro area that without duly taking the monetary analysis into account, inflation in the euro area would have been distinctly higher at times of financial exuberance and would have fallen deep into negative territory in the wake of the financial market collapse, starting in the autumn of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.84,0)">The economy as a whole would have been more volatile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">On a more general note, by including monetary analysis in their monetary strategy, central banks can ensure that important information stemming from money and credit, typically neglected in conventional cyclical forecasting models of the economy, is considered in the formulation of monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">There is compelling empirical evidence showing that at low frequencies, that is over medium to longer-term horizons, inflation shows a robust positive association with monetary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.99,0)">Complementarity between price stability and financial stability The fifth lesson from the financial crisis is that ensuring price stability is not sufficient for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To be sure, the conventional wisdom prevailing before the crisis was twofold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">First, stabilising inflation would do the job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.49,0)">As inflation is – according to the pre-crisis consensus – a summary statistic for the state of the economy, for demand pressures, then any exuberance in financial markets would not be policy-relevant unless it exerts upward pressures on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Second, and partly as a consequence, central banks should only pick up the pieces after the bubble has burst, and the costs of doing this relative to a policy of resisting the bubble while it is forming would not be large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.51,0)">Both these prescriptions have turned out to be major mistakes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.35,0)">For one thing, inflation and financial exuberance are often negatively – not positively – correlated, so that concentrating a central bank on inflation only means biasing the assessment of the risks to the macro-economy from a longer-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.13,0)">And, cleaning up the economy in the wake of a financial collapse can be exceedingly costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This raises the question of whether central banks should be given the task of ensuring both price stability and financial stability, and possibly given additional tools to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.49,0)">The interlinkages between financial stability and price stability and between monetary policy and prudential supervision have become more evident as a result of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">Monetary policy can affect systemic risk via a number of channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">First, being mandated to a price stability objective, a central bank sets in place the necessary conditions for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.9,0)">Economic history tells us that without price stability financial stability is certainly absent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.81,0)">Either inflation hedging might take the most improvised and destabilising forms, or the central bank itself – going through cycles of go-stop policies – might become an independent source of macroeconomic instability and thus financial volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We all remember that a long span of time of unanchored inflation expectations and poor inflation records encouraged all sorts of self-made strategies of inflation hedging in the 1970s in many industrialised countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Italy’s housing market, for example, received a formidable boost from Italians’ attempt to insure against sustained losses in purchasing power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.82,0)">But as soon as monetary policy in the 1980s changed paths and embarked on decisive stabilisation, and inflation risks subsided, house prices started to plummet, making the disinflationary recession more painful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.91,0)">So, lack of price stability generates financial volatility and financial volatility aggravates macroeconomic uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">A second channel through which monetary policy can contribute to financial stability is through its lender-of-last-resort function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.24,0)">When financial markets become dysfunctional and the monetary transmission channels are no longer working properly, monetary policy has a role to play in supporting the liquidity conditions of solvent and illiquid banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I mentioned this before – when I described the ECB’s reaction to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.14,0)">Third, more recent analysis has drawn attention to a channel through which monetary policy might also – unintentionally – influence the perception of risk by financial markets and thus, ultimately, the assumption of risk by financial agents: the so-called risk-taking channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Financial institutions apparently increase their leverage during booms and reduce it during recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.27,0)">Thus, contrary to common assumptions, financial institutions’ leverage is pro-cyclical; the expansion and contraction of balance sheets amplifies, rather than counteracts, the credit cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.72,0)">Protracted loose monetary conditions can foster excessive risk-taking and, consequentially, produce a build-up of financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">If not accurately controlled, this channel can add to the pro-cyclicality of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Now, you have two ways to counter financial pro-cyclicality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The first is through a monetary policy regime that is not centred exclusively on inflation, but leans against the wind of financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.7,0)">What does this mean?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It means, for example, implementing a tighter policy in the face of financial exuberance than would be justified by the same inflation outlook in more tranquil market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">It means tolerating a downdrift in inflation in exchange for some more insurance against greater and more disruptive risks to price and financial stability in the longer run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The second way to counter financial pro-cyclicality is through macro-prudential supervision, a new perspective of macroeconomic control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Macro-prudential supervision aims to support the stability of the financial system as such and seeks to dampen its pro-cyclicality by eliciting regulatory and supervisory instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">From the central bank’s perspective, this implies that macro-prudential supervision is relevant to the extent that it has an impact on the functioning of the transmission mechanism through which a central bank seeks to influence the outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">It is clear that the two policies are complementary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.17,0)">But, does one of them make the other redundant?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.27,0)">I don’t think so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Let me advance my own view about the correct way to organise the interaction between the two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">A leaning-against-the-wind approach in monetary policy prevents a risk-less interest rate – the floor to all borrowing costs in the economy – from becoming pro-cyclical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.01,0)">Macro-prudential policies make sure that the leverage that the economy creates at that floor interest rate and the spreads that are paid by risky borrowers over and above the floor interest rate set by the central bank do not become an additional pro-cyclical source of volatility for the financial system and the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">How about the other dimension of supervision: micro-prudential policies?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Macro-prudential supervision aims at limiting the likelihood of failure of significant portions of the financial system, or systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.12,0)">It follows that the macro-prudential supervision stresses the possibility that actions that may seem desirable or reasonable from the perspective of individual institutions may result in unwelcome system outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Micro-prudential supervision, instead, aims at limiting the likelihood of failure of individual institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">While the two policies have clearly a different scope, ultimately the micro-prudential sphere provides the instruments that can be activated in response to macro-prudential risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.68,0)">An issue which has attracted attention in the past is whether central banks should be entrusted with supervisory powers – the instruments – or whether those powers should remain within a separate body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.52,0)">My take on this dispute is the following.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The experience of the crisis tends to suggest that having the micro and macro-prudential instruments well integrated among other functions within the central bank might be desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.63,0)">Why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Because it always makes good sense to coordinate objectives with instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">And it looks to me natural that such coordination might best be performed by the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Independent bodies are better able to deal with the necessary exchange of information between the monetary and supervisory functions, and can build any Chinese wall between the two that may be needed to avoid conflicts of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Progress has been made since the eruption of the crisis in several countries, with the supervisory powers being transferred from a separate institution, which in many cases was insufficiently independent from the political authorities, to the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.56,0)">But organising the coordinating role in the euro area context remains a complex undertaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.19,0)">This is due not only to the fact that, national supervisory authorities are sometimes part of the national central banks, while in other cases they are separate institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.22,0)">It is a complex environment because, even in a hypothetical situation in which all supervisory authorities were integrated in the central banks, this function would still be exercised at the level of the national jurisdiction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In other words, in a monetary union the need for coordination is twofold: coordination between the macro and the micro functions, and coordination between the authorities exercising the micro function locally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Some progress has been achieved with the creation of the three European supervisory authorities   and the European Systemic Risk Board, which comprises the central banks and the three European agencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The ESRB will be able to make recommendations, while implementation remains the responsibility of the national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This crisis has shown the need for more than just increased cooperation, but rather institutions able to take timely and effective decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is the direction that European integration will have to take going forward.</span>
