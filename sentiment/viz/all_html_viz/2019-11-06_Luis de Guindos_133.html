    <span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)"> Welcome remarks Remarks by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the ECB Forum on Banking Supervision, Frankfurt am Main, 6 November 2019 Welcome to the third ECB Forum on Banking Supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">November 2014, exactly five years ago, was certainly a crossroads for the euro area banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism conferred both micro- and macroprudential responsibilities on the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">I will therefore focus on our achievements and challenges in coordinating both functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">In particular, I will touch upon our joint effort in carrying out banking sector stress tests and our interaction in the conduct of prudential policy in the current environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Micro- and macroprudential interaction and coordination Looking back, the financial crisis was a wakeup call for all of us to strengthen financial regulation and banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">For Europe, it especially implied harmonising supervision across Member States to protect it from national agendas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.84,0)">But the crisis also showed that supervising individual institutions in isolation cannot safeguard the stability of the system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Macroprudential policy has to complement supervisory scrutiny by accounting for system-wide macro-financial feedback loops.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Thanks to this system-wide perspective, macroprudential policy can address structural vulnerabilities and act countercyclically – tightening requirements when we see excessive risk-taking, and loosening them to avoid a credit crunch after risks have materialised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Embedding both micro- and macroprudential responsibilities within the ECB ensures that our actions are based on consistent information and are coordinated for the banking union as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">While retaining ultimate responsibility, the ECB carries out its supervisory tasks within the Single Supervisory Mechanism, comprising the ECB and national competent authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In turn, for macroprudential policy national authorities remain the first line of defence to promptly counter emerging systemic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">But the ECB can set higher macroprudential requirements than those set by national authorities, if necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">National and European bodies complement each other and have jointly strengthened our banking and financial system .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Exercising the micro- and macroprudential function requires close coordination and cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.71,0)">One of the most notable examples is stress-testing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The biennial EU-wide stress test exercises are microprudential in nature and based on a constrained bottom-up approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">They aim to assess the resilience of the largest EU credit institutions to adverse economic and financial circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The stress test exercises are important inputs for the ECB’s Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process    and provide valuable insights for broader financial stability analyses based on granular information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Over the last five years, cooperation between micro- and macroprudential authorities has increased in all phases of the stress-testing process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Today, micro- and macroprudential supervision complement each other by building on their respective knowledge of the banking system to provide a sound and credible assessment of banks’ resilience to stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For instance, during the preparatory phase, supervisors and regulators discuss in detail the stress test methodology and the calibration of the adverse scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the execution phase, supervisors conduct thorough quality assurance of banks’ bottom-up stress tests by challenging banks’ own figures, also using results from macroprudential top-down models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The top-down models are not only employed by supervisors to gain a macroprudential perspective; they can be used more broadly to understand the aggregate implications of banks’ dynamic responses to stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The major advantage of these models is that they account for the propagation and amplification of shocks across the banking system and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Today’s stress-testing framework, with its micro- and macroprudential elements, is the result of sustained improvements since the financial crisis thanks to the ongoing involvement of all stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">The continued importance of stakeholder involvement is already apparent – discussions about the design of the long-term stress test strategy in Europe are under way within both the ECB and the European Banking Authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Without pre-empting future discussions about this strategy, our experiences so far have shown the benefits of including top-down approaches in supervisory assessments, and of considering the wider, macroprudential dimensions of stress-testing in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Looking ahead, I believe that top-down stress test models could play a more important role in disciplining banks and reducing their incentives to systematically underestimate vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Countercyclical macroprudential policy These models will also help micro- and macroprudential authorities to address challenges in the current macro-financial environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.59,0)">Over the past few months, we have observed a deteriorating global economic outlook and increasing uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.1,0)">This environment might put pressure on banks’ profitability and hamper their intermediation capacity as margins become squeezed and the flow of new business slows down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Under these conditions, it is particularly important that banks remain resilient and can withstand adverse shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Since the financial crisis, the resilience of euro area banks has improved significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This has been facilitated by the economic recovery and by an accommodative monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">But most of all, it reflects both the increased market pressure for banks to be well-capitalised, and the introduction of regulatory reforms, including macroprudential buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The currently implemented macroprudential buffers amount to 1% of risk-weighted assets and are intended to absorb losses by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Of all these buffers, only the countercyclical capital buffer   is intended to be released.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.92,0)">The remaining buffers are structural in nature and are not intended to be released in a severe downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.0,0)">Should bank capital ratios fall below the combined buffer requirements, they would also breach the thresholds for the maximum distributable amount  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.18,0)">Once the MDA thresholds are breached, banks face automatic restrictions on their profit distributions to ensure that they keep funds on their balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Banks will likely want to avoid these restrictions – even in a systemic event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">In such an event, banks may have the incentive to prop up capital ratios by deleveraging and disposing assets instead of dipping into the buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.12,0)">The resulting credit crunch would procyclically aggravate the downturn, as experienced in previous crisis episodes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Only with releasable buffers in place can macroprudential policy fully play its countercyclical role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In an adverse scenario, the macroprudential authority would release the buffer and thereby lower the MDA threshold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">To be fully effective, the freed capital space would need to support the economy and not be used to satisfy shareholders’ demand for dividends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The CCyB is the instrument designed by legislation to be released.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">However, the CCyB has only recently been announced and activated in the euro area; just 7 of the 19 euro area countries have activated it; and it represents only a very limited amount of capital relative to the other requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.58,0)">The limited available capital for release constrains the room for manoeuvre of macroprudential authorities, making it harder to support the economy in a severe downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.16,0)">In the current environment, it is therefore legitimate to question whether the banking system has a sufficiently large capital buffer that can be released.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Even if we consider the level of capital to be appropriate, there still seems to be scope to have a higher share of capital in the form of releasable buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Looking around the world, we see that other authorities, for example in the United Kingdom and the United States, are having similar discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Concluding remarks Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">With the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, the ECB was given micro- and macroprudential responsibilities and powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">This set-up aims to ensure that the two policies are well coordinated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.76,0)">At the same time, the current macro-financial environment has become more challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.31,0)">The bleaker and more uncertain outlook can create strains for bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.14,0)">Challenges also arise for the non-bank sector with potential spillovers to the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">So for us to ensure the stability of the banking sector, we also need to deepen our understanding of the role of non-bank institutions in the financial system and monitor the risks associated with their activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Continuing to provide a consistent policy response in the current macro-financial environment requires the countercyclical role of macroprudential policy to be strengthened by ensuring that releasable buffers are available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Ultimately, the microprudential and macroprudential functions will need to rely on each other to provide successful prudential policies that ensure financial stability and support financial intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">, “Macroprudential policy at the ECB: Institutional framework, strategy, analytical tools and policies”, Occasional Paper Series, No 227, European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Under this approach, banks generate their stress test projections using their own models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">These projections are based on a macro-financial scenario that is the same for all banks and are subject to a predefined methodology prescribed by the European Banking Authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">ECB Banking Supervision uses both the qualitative results   and the quantitative results   as inputs for the SREP, to inform the setting of Pillar 2 capital requirements and Pillar 2 capital guidance, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The ECB conducts the stress test both for those banks which are part of the exercise coordinated by the European Banking Authority and for the rest of the significant institutions which are directly supervised by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">3 of the November 2018 Financial Stability Review, as well as Andersson, M. et
