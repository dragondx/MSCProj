finally, there will be no difference between sending a payment from Rome to Dublin or from Brussels to Antwerp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">We can now make payments not only with euro notes and coins, but harmonised electronic payments by European credit transfer, direct debit and payment card as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">An important milestone has been reached today with the launch of “SEPA Credit Transfer”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">We are now able to send euro payments quickly, and in the same way, to any beneficiary in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This will be followed by “SEPA Direct Debit” before the end of 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">As a result, we will be able to make direct debit payments across Europe, as if no borders existed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">With the “SEPA Cards Framework”, extensive changes await the European cards market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The ECB expects a new European card scheme to emerge, harmonising card payments across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">That said, efficient national card schemes should not vanish, leaving the cards market entirely to international card schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Let’s work together and use the experience of the national schemes to devise a new European card scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Together, these three payment instruments make up SEPA, our key to a door behind which many opportunities lie.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Once the door is open we will still have a mountain to climb.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">But if we are willing to take up the challenge and use SEPA with innovative thinking, we can reap the full benefit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Let me stress: we do not envision opening the door only to sit back and admire the great many opportunities on the other side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Let’s climb the mountain, discover the opportunities and progress onwards and upwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Let’s complement the SEPA instruments with innovative services, such as online and mobile payment initiation, e-invoicing and e-reconciliation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">By combining these services with SEPA instruments, we eliminate paper and the payment process becomes fully electronic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.45,0)">End-users will spend less time on payments – and, as we all know, time means money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">But how will you benefit from SEPA?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Corporates – make fast European transactions, simplify your payment handling and consolidate your liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">SEPA’s harmonised services can optimise your payment process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">So, request these services from your banks and service providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Public administrations – you will experience the same benefits as corporates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.09,0)">But that’s not all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">SEPA can help drive e-Government and e-procurement, thereby promoting efficient public services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">By adopting SEPA at an early stage, you will extend its benefits to society at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Consumers – one bank account and one set of payment instruments is all you need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">As with euro notes and coins, there will finally be no difference between payments across Europe – all euro payments will be ”domestic”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And banks – you have developed and will form the basis of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">And SEPA can help you expand your business, as integration and harmonisation will encourage competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">It is now up to you to use the opportunities SEPA brings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The launch of SEPA today is a major step in creating the Single Market and represents a significant contribution to the Lisbon agenda and a more competitive Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">It has not been easy to arrive at where we are today – SEPA has been a formidable challenge, but formidable challenges make us stronger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.08,0)">It is not time to sit back in admiration; it is time to use SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">So, let’s rise to the challenge; let’s use SEPA, our key; and let’s discover the great many opportunities that lie on the other side of that door.</span>
