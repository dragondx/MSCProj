    <span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)"> Sponsors dinner of the European Cultural Days Dinner speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, on the occasion of a get-together of friends and supporters of the European Cultural Days organised in cooperation with Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt am Main, 20 June 2016 First of all, many thanks to the hosts, Friedrich von Metzler, honorary citizen of Frankfurt, and Sylvia von Metzler, who, as friends of the EUROPEAN CULTURAL DAYS of the ECB, have again this year opened the doors of their home to us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Hospitality is becoming increasingly important in a world which is growing ever closer together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">That includes offering hospitality to people from other countries and cultures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.92,0)">But it is precisely this type of hospitality that some people find difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Allow me to quote from a French cultural icon – not from Proust or Flaubert – but from an Asterix adventure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In the story, an innkeeper from the town of Orange moves with his family to the small Gallic village where Asterix lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.69,0)">This prompts Geriatrix, the oldest inhabitant there, to say: “You know me, I’ve got nothing against foreigners, some of my best friends are foreigners, but these particular foreigners aren’t from this village!”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.95,0)">This story was published in 1974, but the sentiment is alarmingly familiar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.6,0)">Fear of purported foreigners prevents many people from showing hospitality – it’s the same today as it was forty or a hundred years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.5,0)">But are people from different backgrounds and cultures really so foreign?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.54,0)">Are they really different from us?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.27,0)">I don’t think so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is precisely art and culture that show us this so clearly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.02,0)">All over the world, people are making music, painting pictures, telling stories and performing plays.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.29,0)">And fundamentally it is always the same feelings that are being expressed: joy, sorrow, anger, love, hope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Whatever the medium of expression may be, at heart the message is the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Art and culture teach us much about others and much about ourselves – but above all they show us how much we all have in common.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">The goal and the merit of the ECB’s European Cultural Days is to showcase these similarities and at the same time promote understanding of the differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The focus on culture is indeed in the spirit of a great European – Jean Monnet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">He reportedly said: “If I had a chance to start the construction of Europe again, I would start with culture”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Jean Monnet was convinced that Europe belongs together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">He was convinced that it has to, and that it can, belong together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I share this conviction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">And your support, ladies and gentlemen, for the ECB’s Cultural Days shows me that you too share this conviction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">This year’s series of cultural events will also help to make Europe grow a little closer together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">You are all making an important contribution to that, and I warmly thank you on behalf of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Looking back, we also wish to thank Malta, which delighted us with a great programme last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Malta is a first-class example of how different cultures can come together and forge something new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">A distinct culture has, over time, emerged from Carthaginian, Phoenician, Roman, French and British influences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Thinking very long term, I see it as providing inspiration for a united Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, we don’t have to look quite so far into the future for the Cultural Days 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Our thanks go to the Deutsche Bundesbank, with whom the ECB is jointly organising the EUROPEAN CULTURAL DAYS this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Andreas Dombret will give us a brief overview of the highlights of the programme shortly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.56,0)">As for myself, I would like to conclude by referring to another European, who was born in Dublin, lived in London and died in Paris: Oscar Wilde.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.77,0)">His view of culture was as down to earth as it was comprehensible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">He said: “Culture depends on cookery”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">In that respect, this evening is an additional cultural reward for us all.</span>
