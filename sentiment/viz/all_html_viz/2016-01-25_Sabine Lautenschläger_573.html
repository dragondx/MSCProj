    <span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)"> Remarks on the collection of credit data   Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs   at the European Parliament, Brussels, 25 January 2016 Mr Chair, Honourable members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much for this opportunity to discuss “AnaCredit” with you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Such occasions are highly valued both by the European Central Bank   as an institution and by me personally, as they enable open discussions where we can explain our policies and, in this case, one of our major projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.47,0)">There have already been several exchanges between us in writing; Mr Bier, the ECB’s Deputy Director General Statistics, attended a hearing in December 2015; and there was also an inquiry by the Ombudsman, which is now closed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">So a considerable amount of information on AnaCredit is available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Nevertheless, I understand that several questions and possible misunderstandings remain, some of which I would like to address in my introductory remarks by: recalling why AnaCredit is pivotal in supporting the ECB in the performance of its statutory tasks; defining AnaCredit’s requirements; and setting out the costs linked to AnaCredit and the stakeholders’ involvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I would be happy to answer other questions later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Rationale for AnaCredit The ECB’s Governing Council decided to launch the AnaCredit project in 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It will establish a Eurosystem database comprising loan-by-loan data on credit granted by euro area financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.17,0)">The background for this decision was that, currently, the information provided on granular credit datasets across the euro area is very heterogeneous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">AnaCredit will standardise the collection of credit data and significantly improve the Eurosystem’s ability to conduct in-depth analysis and meaningful comparisons of the provision of credit within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Loan-by-loan information provided by AnaCredit will enable the consistent analysis of information on the demand and supply of credit for monetary policy purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.41,0)">Slow credit growth may be linked to supply hindrances, such as banks’ low asset quality, or demand obstacles, such as the high indebtedness of certain industries being reflected in higher borrowing costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Being able to match the size of the loan to its interest rate and the collateral used will also enable us to gain a better understanding of how small and medium-sized enterprises   are affected by monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Clearly, having an accurate breakdown of how monetary policy measures affect the economy in general, and price levels in particular, is an essential ingredient for their preparation and for ensuring their effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Data provided by AnaCredit will also support our financial stability analysis, as it will enable us to consistently evaluate macro-financial risks originating from exposure to sectoral risks, and to suggest fine-tuned macroprudential policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">AnaCredit will also be critical in supporting the ECB’s monetary policy operations and risk management activities, both of which are key for a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Banks will also benefit from AnaCredit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Credit institutions are allowed to take part in monetary policy operations, provided they are eligible counterparties and provide adequate collateral for the liquidity provided by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Loans to non-financial institutions or households are eligible for use in these operations, subject to certain conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">When assessing the eligibility of this collateral, AnaCredit will be fundamental.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">AnaCredit, therefore, is a crucial development that will greatly aid the Eurosystem in conducting its core tasks, ranging from monetary policy and monetary policy operations, through financial stability analysis and macroprudential policy, to collateral and risk management, as well as economic research and the production of statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It is very clear that, while some of the data could also be used for supervisory purposes, AnaCredit in its current format is not designed for banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The AnaCredit project was launched in 2011 – long before European banking supervision was even considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The draft regulation on AnaCredit, which was published on 4 December 2015, does not include any specific supervisory requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Nevertheless, based on the experience gained with AnaCredit, the ECB may decide to follow a staggered approach of progressively covering different market segments in different stages at significant intervals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">AnaCredit could also be extended to cater for supervisory requirements in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In line with our legal obligations, any such plans would have to undergo public consultation before the Governing Council could take a decision on the matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Defining the requirements The usefulness of AnaCredit results from the requirement to provide 94 data attributes relating to features of the debtor, the loan, the interest rate and the collateral securing the loan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.78,0)">However, the number of actual variables is fewer than 94.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">For instance, the borrower’s address alone contributes seven data attributes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, given the multiple purposes for which the data are intended, and in order to reduce the reporting burden for banks, which might otherwise have to provide similar information several times, these 94 data attributes are necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">More importantly, AnaCredit requires information that is already available to every bank and that they need in order to grant credit, while borrowers will hardly have to provide more information than they currently do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.7,0)">The setup costs of AnaCredit Nevertheless, AnaCredit does not come without costs, and I fully acknowledge that the reporting burden for banks is of particular concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The initial investment by banks to improve their IT systems and reporting practices will, over time, be offset by the gains arising from lower running costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Compared with collecting aggregated statistical information, there will be fewer ad hoc data requests from central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.24,0)">Such on-demand requests are typically burdensome and costly for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Thanks to the flexibility offered by granular data, the ECB will be able not only to compile the aggregate statistical information but also to combine and reconfigure the existing data to continually construct new statistics and relevant indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">However, the setup costs will vary greatly across banks, and costs for small and medium-sized banks in particular have been a focus of attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It is important to note that many small and medium-sized banks are part of an association with a common IT service provider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Combined, they are, in many credit market segments, bigger than some large banks and just as cost efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In fact, due to shared IT solutions that automate data management, credit data collection and processing are the same irrespective of whether a credit is provided by a small or large credit institution within the same association.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Moreover, the draft regulation on AnaCredit explicitly gives national central banks the option to take into account the specific situations of credit institutions by exempting them, in part or in full, from reporting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">For some countries  , as many as 700 to 1,000 small and medium-sized banks could be granted such exemptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">I am confident that the national central banks will find the right balance to ensure that their small and medium-sized banks are not overburdened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The stakeholders’ involvement In 2014 the ECB conducted the “merits and costs” procedure as referred to in Council Regulation   No 2533/98 concerning the collection of statistical information by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">This quality assurance procedure rationalised the requirements of AnaCredit with a view to balancing the benefits and costs, in particular for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">To ensure that the ECB’s cost assessment would benefit from the views and inputs of stakeholders, the ECB held over 25 meetings on AnaCredit with banking representatives at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In addition, at the national level, national central banks have held countless meetings with their banking representatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The Governing Council also decided to publish the draft regulation on AnaCredit and provided the public with the opportunity to submit observations by 29 January 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Before the regulation is adopted, the Governing Council will carefully consider any comments received.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Conclusions Credible and high quality statistics lie at the heart of the ECB’s policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">AnaCredit reflects a key statistical feature, namely the ability to adapt flexibly to new economic circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.76,0)">We should also ask ourselves the following question: what would be the costs of not implementing AnaCredit?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.87,0)">The crisis reminded us how hard it is to predict the policy questions that will need to be addressed in a few years from now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.56,0)">As a result of the collection of granular data through AnaCredit, Eurosystem policy considerations will be far less constrained by statistics not being available in a timely manner.</span>
