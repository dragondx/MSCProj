    <span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)"> The euro: Accelerator of Economic Growth in Europe Speech delivered by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the lunch-meeting of Cercle d'Union Interalliée on 23 June 1999 in Paris Introduction On 1 January of this year, the euro was introduced in 11 countries   with a total population of almost 300 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">The start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union   established a combined economy that is only slightly smaller than that of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">So, both in human and economic resources, the euro area can be compared with the largest economy in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Furthermore, eventual participation of the four countries which have not yet adopted the Single European currency - Denmark, Greece, Sweden and the United Kingdom - would only further enhance the economic weight of the euro area and promote the contribution of Europe to world economic development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">In this sense, the euro is truly an accelerator of economic growth, as the use of the same currency in the euro area will increase cross-border competition and market integration, thereby enlarging economic prosperity for European citizens that will spillover to other European and non-European countries as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">It is my conviction that EMU could be a catalyst for economic progress in Europe, and could fundamentally re-shape the contours of the world economic order in the 21st century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Today I shall deal with the benefits of EMU and the stability-oriented policies that have to be implemented in order to reap the full potential of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Making EMU a success is a process which requires the efforts of all of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Economic Growth - The Benefits of EMU I should now like to address the benefits of EMU and why I believe that the introduction of the euro and the single monetary policy should result in higher economic growth in the euro area and thereby contribute positively to the development of the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The degree to which these benefits are achieved depends not only on the monetary policy of the Eurosystem, but even more so on accompanying stability-oriented fiscal and appropriate labour market policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">When speaking of the Eurosystem, I refer to the European Central Bank   and the eleven national central banks   of the participating Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">The most important contribution that the Eurosystem's monetary policy can make towards exploiting to the maximum the benefits of EMU is to fulfil its primary objective to maintain price stability, as stipulated in the Treaty on European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.93,0)">As has long been argued by central bankers and academic economists, inflation is costly, both economically and socially  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.27,0)">Nobel prize-winner Milton Friedman expressed this well in 1980, when he said : "Inflation is a disease, a dangerous and sometimes fatal disease, a disease that if not checked in time can destroy a society"  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.08,0)">The same could be said about deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">In my view, EMU is a tool to consolidate the progress made towards price stability in recent years and to firmly anchor expectations in line with price stability, and thereby establish the necessary framework to seize the opportunities of monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The Eurosystem enjoys full independence to determine the appropriate level of interest rates in order to satisfy its primary objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.59,0)">Moreover, the members of the ECB Governing Council have long terms of office and are only dismissible for serious misconduct or inability to perform their duties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">These provisions imply that the concept of monetary stability benefits from explicit legal statutes and that the credibility of the Eurosystem will be safeguarded by protecting the monetary policymaking process from political interference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">A further important benefit of EMU is that it has greatly reduced the risk of real exchange rate misalignments within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">This fosters economic growth and avoids a misallocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">In fact, it enables the European Single Market to function smoothly to the advantage of producers and consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">EMU has eliminated nominal exchange rate volatility and exchange rate risks within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">This benefits not only trade between, and economic growth in, the euro area countries but also the economic development of other European and non-European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">In addition, foreign direct investments into the euro area economies should be promoted, as these investments are negatively affected by exchange rate volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The advantages of economic integration afforded by the Single Market process are enhanced by the elimination of the transaction costs of exchanging different currencies, the direct result of the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Furthermore, the single currency will make prices across the euro area directly comparable, which should increase competition and hence efficiency and economic growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">A number of further positive effects on economic growth flow from the elimination of separate currencies in the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">One benefit is the potential for the reduction of risk premia built into real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">This in turn will stimulate investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">By facilitating the development of deep and integrated capital markets, the single currency should further reduce long-term rates via the elimination of premia resulting from less liquid markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.47,0)">For example, empirical research has shown that due to more liquid markets, US long-term interest rates are 25 to 50 basis points lower than comparable European interest rates  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In addition, a wider and deeper capital market in the euro area will improve intermediation between savers and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Finally, EMU may stimulate further political integration of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In general, the process of European integration has been driven and continues to be driven by the political conviction that an integrated Europe will be safer, more stable and more prosperous than a fragmented Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">In this sense, the introduction of a single currency in the euro area could become an important symbol of political and social integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">It could serve as a catalyst for further integration in other areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Ensuring the Benefits  : A Stability-Oriented Monetary Policy As I mentioned earlier, the most important contribution of the Eurosystem's monetary policy to economic growth in the euro area is achieving its primary objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The specific way in which the ECB should pursue this primary objective is laid down by what is called the monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I should like to address now the main aspects of the Eurosystem's strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">First, in order to guide expectations of future price developments and to facilitate the public's assessment of the success of the single monetary policy, the Governing Council of the ECB has announced a quantitative definition of its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">That is, price stability has been defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Price stability is to be maintained over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Second, to maintain price stability according to this published definition, we have chosen a distinct monetary policy strategy, one that reflects the special circumstances that exist at present as well as those likely to prevail in the foreseeable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">It ensures as much continuity as possible with the strategies previously pursued by the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">At the same time, it gives due consideration to the unique situation that prevails in the early years of the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Our strategy rests on two "pillars": a prominent role for money as expressed by the announcement of a reference value for the annual growth of M3 and a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments, and the risks to price stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In the context of the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB has announced a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate  , which has been set at an annual rate of 4½%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.28,0)">Under normal circumstances, substantial deviations from the reference value would tend to indicate future risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.2,0)">However, monetary policy does not react to deviations of monetary growth from the reference value in a "mechanistic" way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the first instance, such deviations will be thoroughly analysed to infer any signals which they may send about the prospects for price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">If this analysis points to a threat to price stability, monetary policy will react in a manner appropriate to counter this threat, rather than attempt to eliminate the deviation of monetary growth from the reference value in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.51,0)">Although monetary data contain information which is vital for monetary policy decision-making, monetary developments alone will clearly not constitute a complete summary of all the economic information necessary to enable appropriate policy decisions to be taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">That is why it is important to monitor simultaneously a wide range of financial and other economic indicators, including economic forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This broadly based assessment constitutes the second pillar of our monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">All in all, the combination of the two pillars of the Eurosystem's strategy ensures that monetary, financial and economic developments are closely monitored and analysed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">On the basis of this thorough analysis, the interest rate will be set in a way that best serves the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Ensuring the Benefits  : Stability-Oriented Non-Monetary Policies Let me now turn to the importance of prudent and stability-oriented non-monetary policies in order to reap the fruits of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">I should like to emphasise that the true benefits of EMU derive from the unique opportunity to shape a macroeconomic environment conducive to stability, growth and employment, and to foster structural change which is needed to maintain medium- to long-term dynamism in the European economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The full benefits of the single currency will arise only if there is appropriate support from other stability-oriented policies, especially fiscal and labour market policies, and if structural reforms are carried out in these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Thus, price stability is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for grasping all the opportunities of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">As regards fiscal policy, it is of the utmost importance that the governments of the EU Member States pursue in implementing fiscal policies that aim at a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This condition is stipulated by the Stability and Growth Pact, to ensure lasting compliance of fiscal policies with the requirement of budgetary prudence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.47,0)">From the perspective of a central banker, a prime reason for the establishment of the Pact is that a lack of fiscal discipline would negatively impact on the Eurosystem's policies to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me elaborate on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The institutional framework of EMU and the Eurosystem has been designed so as to prevent any direct link between an increase in public sector deficits and a monetary expansion, and thereby inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This is ensured by assigning to the Eurosystem the primary objective of price stability, banning direct financing of government deficits by central banks and precluding any influence by governments or other institutions on monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">However, even in this setting, the conduct of fiscal policies has a clear bearing on the objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.45,0)">In particular, doubts about the soundness of fiscal policy can influence the effectiveness of monetary policy instruments and undermine the credibility of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">For decades - and until very recently - fiscal policies have followed a trend of ever-growing public sector and government debt levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In EMU, without binding fiscal rules, countries might have even less incentive to pursue prudent fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.03,0)">The main reason is that risk premia offsetting inflation and exchange rate expectations disappear on a country-specific basis and may not be fully outweighed by default risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Hence, the Treaty establishing the European Community contains a number of provisions on the conduct of fiscal policies, which have been further clarified by the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">In this sense, the Stability and Growth Pact is an essential safeguard to ensure that price and fiscal stability remain the cornerstones of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Therefore, we attach great importance to the implementation of this Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.05,0)">It is a misunderstanding to believe that the Stability and Growth Pact is imposed on countries only as a price they have to pay for entry into EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In fact the Pact just stipulates what had to be achieved in any case, with or without EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The need for addressing budgetary imbalances is clear, in particular, from the costs associated with the ageing of the population, which will soon require additional budgetary room for manoeuvre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.96,0)">According to long-term projections and estimates, current trends in birth rates and life expectancy, together with unfunded public pension and health care schemes, result in very high implicit government liabilities in most euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.47,0)">In many cases these implicit liabilities appear to be far in excess of official government debt levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Let me turn now to the contribution that structural reforms, particularly of euro area labour markets, can play in reducing unemployment and in supporting the stability of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.91,0)">The high level of European unemployment is rightly a source of deep concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Clearly, the approaches that are most likely to have a lasting effect are those that address the root cause of the problem, not just the symptoms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.56,0)">The root causes of high unemployment in the European Union are structural rigidities in labour markets as well as tax and public transfer policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This view is supported by a wide body of academic literature and was also a key finding of the OECD Jobs Study.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.76,0)">The underlying structural nature of the European unemployment problem can be seen most strikingly if one compares developments in Europe with those in the United States over the last three decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.06,0)">In 1970, the unemployment rate in the United States, at around 4%, was at least twice as large as that prevailing in most European economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.43,0)">Since 1970 there has been significant cyclical variation in the unemployment rate in the United States, but no upward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.28,0)">At 4.2% in May 1999, the unemployment rate in the United States is almost the same as it was in 1970.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">In contrast, average European unemployment appears to have risen with each passing economic cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.53,0)">By the early 1980s the unemployment rates in the United States and Europe had broadly converged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.24,0)">Since then the unemployment rate in the United States has been below the average for the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.53,0)">Despite recording some decline last year, the euro area unemployment rate was 10.4% in April 1999, more than double the corresponding rate in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.75,0)">However, some European countries, particularly those with more flexible labour markets, have managed to avoid the trend of ever-rising unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.84,0)">For example, the Netherlands, Ireland, Portugal, Austria and Luxembourg at present have unemployment rates well below the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.21,0)">If one examines the duration of unemployment, it is immediately apparent that Europe's problem is principally one of long-term unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.49,0)">According to OECD figures, around half of the unemployed of the European Union has been out of work for at least a year, while in the United States, under 10% of the unemployed have been without work for this long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">This suggests that in Europe there is an urgent need to improve incentives aimed at getting the long-term unemployed back to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">There are many good examples of what can be done - and is currently being done in some euro area countries - in terms of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.74,0)">First, there are measures to ensure that low-productivity workers are not forced out of the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">To this end, the burden of taxes and non-wage labour costs could be reduced for low-paid workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In addition, minimum wage schemes and wage agreements reached by collective bargaining need to take account of the need to preserve jobs for low-productivity workers by reducing labour costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Second, there are "active labour market measures" which provide programmes of education, training and work experience targeted at the long-term unemployed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Third, reforms to the tax and benefit systems could be implemented which ensure that people are significantly better off in work than out of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.07,0)">I recognise that structural reforms are not always easy to implement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.39,0)">The benefits are often enjoyed in the medium term, while short-term costs for some groups may mean that reforms are vigorously opposed by interest groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Although there is a common objective of reducing unemployment, there is no common programme of reforms that will work in all countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">While it is possible to learn from the experience of others, each Member State will wish to develop workable policies that reflect its own particular circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Although the path of structural reform is not always an easy one, it is the only way in which we can achieve the lasting reductions in unemployment that are so urgently required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Only structural reforms that aim at stable labour markets where supply and demand meet in a flexible way will ensure that the benefits of EMU for economic growth are really achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Conclusions I am convinced that Economic and Monetary Union provides a great opportunity to create and maintain a large zone of price stability and economic prosperity in Europe, including a substantial reduction of unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">However, while price stability is a necessary condition for fully grasping the opportunities of EMU, it is not in itself sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Stability-oriented polices regarding the development of national fiscal positions and the functioning of labour markets are of crucial importance as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">As I have explained, the benefits of EMU will not arise in a quasi automatic way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">While monetary policy will deliver its contribution by following policies that maintain price stability, other economic policies must be implemented to ensure that the opportunities of the single currency will be fully utilised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.14,0)">Monetary policy alone - however well designed and implemented - cannot solve Europe's economic problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Policy-makers in all areas must be determined to take the new environment of Stage Three of EMU and its consequences appropriately into account when forming their policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Only then will the euro be able to function as a truly accelerator of economic growth in Europe.</span><span
