    <span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)"> The future of cards and payments: SEPA for cards Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBThe IEA & Marketforce’s Inaugural Conference on “The future of cards and payments”London, 2 July 2008   Ladies and gentlemen, You may ask why a central banker is reflecting about cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.64,0)">Isn't monetary policy sufficiently challenging these days?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Let me give you three explanations for this: First, it’s a great pleasure to speak before such distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">And it’s certainly always a pleasure to be in London.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.13,0)">But I realize that this explanation may not suffice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Second, for central bankers efficient financial markets are crucial as they are a prerequisite for a smooth transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.91,0)">In this regard, keeping fragmented markets in the euro zone would not only mean lost opportunities but also less effective monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">And third, in the Maastricht Treaty in 1993, European customers were promised a single market – also for financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Retail banking has still some way to go in this regard and the cards market is one specific example for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.76,0)">What is the ECB’s role in the SEPA project?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Let me emphasise that – besides the conduct of monetary policy - one of the key tasks established by the EU Treaty for the Eurosystem is to promote the smooth operation of payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.31,0)">Moreover, the Lisbon Agenda calls for the removal of technical, legal and commercial barriers also in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">For the area of payments this means greater standardisation and harmonisation promoting competition and fostering an more efficient allocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">SEPA – the project to make all euro payments domestic payments is a great leap forward in that direction – common technical standards, a common legal framework – the Payment Services Directive   – and opening the access to all systems and providers will change the landscape as the MIFID is changing the landscape for the securities business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">What can the ECB do in practice to support it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">While the EPC, the European Payments Council, is in the driving seat and the European Commission can provide legal framework for payments and pressure for more competition to keep the momentum, the ECB’s role is to analyse the issues at stake, offer a platform for debate discussion and to convince audiences of the advantages of a single market for payments – and this is the reason why I am here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.0,0)">Why is SEPA relevant for the UK?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">SEPA offers better and broader services to the euro area financial services market from which anyone benefits that makes and receives payments in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The UK has achieved a lot with “faster payments” and is a perfect example for using cards intensively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">It is obvious, however, that one country’s market can be transformed and harmonized quicker than 15 countries with different customers and payment traditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">But let me emphasize that all the achievements of the SEPA project - and those are and will be many – will create benefits for the market outside the euro area as well  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">What are the benefits of SEPA?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Let me very briefly quote a few studies about the benefits and the great potential of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">According to the European Commission, the potential benefit from SEPA payments could be more than 100 bn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">over the next six years and additional benefits can arise if SEPA will be used as platform for electronic invoicing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">There is also empirical evidence   that harmonisation and standardisation of retail payment instruments across the euro area are likely to create economies of scale in payment services in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Significant cost efficiency gains could be realised if payment processing is consolidated across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In particular, a doubling of payment volume may raise total costs with only 22 percent   which was demonstrated by one of the first cross-border mergers in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">According to an ECB study, banks may significantly reduce their costs, but will face increased competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">SEPA will also offer banks an opportunity to market new, value-added services related to the payment chain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.7,0)">Overall, SEPA offers great opportunities but SEPA migration is a challenge – for banks and for their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.88,0)">Where does the SEPA project currently stand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">SEPA was launched end-January 2008; six months after the launch, some changes are already visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The number of SEPA credit transfers is increasing though still low given that we are in a piloting phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Work in the other fields is advancing well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">There are some concerns on the launch of the SEPA direct debit but I believe that the market will live up to its commitments and solutions to all remaining issues will be found, especially now since the EPC has agreed on some improvements in the SEPA Direct Debit schemes to meet end-users’ demands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The ECB is convinced that the SDD plays a crucial part in realising the SEPA and will contribute to making it a successful project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The timely transposition of the PSD into national law and clarity on the interchange fee for SDD from a competition authority perspective, are crucial to address most of the issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The remaining problems regarding direct debits should be solvable, be it via upgrading the SDD Rulebooks or via additional optional services offered by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.96,0)">But let’s be clear: stalling does not lead anywhere – it’s a loss of time and makes competitors who have started to act to be even stronger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.72,0)">Running parallel systems is very costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Therefore a clear vision and a clear commitment is needed for the realisation of harmonisation and standardisation in retail payments across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">How do cards and SEPA go together?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The SEPA project includes a particular challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Card payments represent an essential part of retail payments, which make the standardistation and the creation of card schemes are important element of the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Over the last few years, volumes of cashless payments in the European Union   have increased by 7% per year  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">In Europe card payments achieved the highest volume growth and have become the most widely used payment instrument after banknotes and coins, with over 25 billion payments per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">There is a lot to win in the field of cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.62,0)">A bird’s eye view on the European card market, however, shows very fragmented national markets, especially regarding card schemes – even though for processors, integration has started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The market is divided into a number of national schemes and international schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But let me just add that the UK belongs to the few countries  , where one international scheme offers also the services of a national scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">What are the benefits of SEPA for card users?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">SEPA for cards means: standardisation, integration instead of current fragmentation and more competition, more choice for consumers  , more choice for banks  , more choice for retailers   and more choice for infrastructures  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">On top of this, a more efficient cards market will create incentives not to use cash as often – this is particularly important for consumers and banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The potential benefit of cards replacing cash as a means of payment is considerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">For consumers, using cards instead of cash will considerably reduce transaction costs which are known to economists as so-called “shoe-leather-costs”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">For banks, an increased use of cards would make cash handling less costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.0,0)">For example, very often cash is withdrawn on Friday, to be used at merchants on Saturday and to be returned by them to the banks on Monday.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.4,0)">According to a recent survey  , the use of cards instead of cash is one of the most underestimated profitability drivers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">An important step for banks, payment institutions and scheme managers towards an increased use of cards is to pursue the growth opportunities that this field offers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.84,0)">A big question, however, remains what overall impact SEPA will have on card payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Even though the benefits are very clear, these can only be fully reaped if the card market is a competitive market with some variety and choice, instead of being limited to only a few players with a strong position in the market for card schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.44,0)">Would SEPA integration together with a strong position of current players in the card market mean that national schemes disappear without trace?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.57,0)">This cannot be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Nonetheless, even if national card schemes will continue to exist, the integration of the European cards market will certainly bring changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The opening of the national markets implies inevitably the potential for mergers, acquisitions, and sell-offs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">More and more banks will be European banks, more and more processors will be European processors and even retailers will have and have already European wide presence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Will the European card market seize the opportunity of change to construct something to its benefit?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.63,0)">Or will it stick to an agreement which will most likely be challenged sooner or later?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">What are current initiatives for an additional card scheme and what are the benefits?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Let me mention several card scheme initiatives which have the potential to make competition in the European cards market livelier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">EAPS follows an interlinking model of national card schemes and a number of countries and a large number of   banks are participating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The Monnet initiative investigates the creation of a new scheme and is – for the time being – driven by German and French banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Payfair is a private initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The ECB welcomes all initiatives and praises the effort and dynamism of the driving entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But I should emphasise that the ECB is neutral towards these initiatives and towards any new initiative that may appear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Some features of the existing initiatives are positive – some nonetheless would need further enhancement - as, for example, a clear commitment of EAPS for a future integration and the involvement of more euro area countries in the Monnet project, and if not now than definitely in a future phase of the project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">All these initiatives follow different concepts and models adding to choice and innovation which characterises a dynamic market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Let’s assume for the moment an additional scheme will emerge: first, this will increase competition, especially if the new scheme follows an economical model without a strong card brand preponderance and without the features offered by international credit cards, such instant free credit, miles, bonuses, and insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.01,0)">This will naturally imply downward pressure on costs and fees, also for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Second, an additional scheme will offer an additional opportunity to substitute cash by cards through wider acceptance, especially if the new scheme follows a cost-efficient model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Looking forward, as a first step, an additional card scheme could start as a basic offering, before becoming a more sophisticated model at a later stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Whether the scheme is debit or credit and the various additional offerings to cardholders and merchants should be an issue of each issuing and acquiring bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Overall, I am however convinced that the benefits of an additional card scheme clearly outweigh the costs and I can reassure you that the continuation of any initiative in the way I outlined will continue to have our support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">SEPA for cards: implementation challenges Certainly, on the way towards new schemes – whatever their origin is – and the realisation of SEPA for cards, some challenges persist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Knowing that examples of scheme rules already exist and that the EPC is working on the card standards, the most challenging phase for the creation of a new scheme seems to achieve a clear commitment and co-ordination among members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In this context it is worthwhile to mention that it is not only technical and business model differences which have to be overcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">SEPA is a European integration project, as is SEPA for cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">As a member of a European multi-cultural organisation I know of the importance not to overlook the cultural dimension either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">An open mind and clear objectives are key in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">With regards to the additional European card scheme, all participating parties should clearly recognise the objective of building a basic service, as a first step which can be further enriched by each individual issuer and acquirer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Let me reassure you that I am confident that all remaining challenges can be addressed and overcome and creative initiatives will be rewarded by success in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In this context, I would also like to underline the importance of communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In this regard, I very much welcome the clarifications provided by the EPC on the SEPA Cards Framework published last week on 26 June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Proper communication is crucial for the success of SEPA as all stakeholders need to be aware about SEPA and the benefits it will bring to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This clarification on the SEPA Cards Framework brings more clarity on what SEPA represents for the payment cards in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">I expect that this is only a first step of the banking industry in enforcing their communication vis a vis their users and that the work of the banking industry on this crucial projects get more visibility in the months to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The ECB continues to stand ready to support the banking industry in this task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Closing remarks   To conclude – SEPA is a far reaching initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">It will reshape the market for retail payments in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.53,0)">SEPA is a promise – stalling does not lead anywhere and operating many parallel systems is costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">SEPA for cards means decision for cross border solutions, new initiatives and creative ways forward are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">SEPA means changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Our host country has proven: it can be done; Belgium with the public sector in the lead is proving it can be done and other countries will follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">This is the reason why a central banker remains interested in the project and I hope any of you will be too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">CapGemini/EC   “SEPA: potential benefits at stake - researching the impact of SEPA on the payments
