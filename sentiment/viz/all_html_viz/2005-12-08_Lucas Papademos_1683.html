    <h3> Speaker: Lucas Papademos </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)"> Opening remarks at the press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the December 2005 Financial Stability Review Speech by Lucas Papademos,Vice-President of the ECB, Frankfurt am Main, 8 December 2005 Ladies and Gentlemen, I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Introduction Welcome to this press briefing on the occasion of the presentation of the December 2005 edition of the ECB’s Financial Stability Review, which is published semi-annually, in June and in December each year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">My presentation today will have three parts  : I will start with some introductory remarks, outlining the purpose, the scope, the method of analysis and the structure of the Review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Thereafter, I will highlight the main sources of risk and vulnerability which we have assessed as emanating from four areas:   the global macro-financial environment;   financial markets;   the balance sheets of euro area households and corporations; and   financial institutions, including banks and insurance companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Finally, I will provide an overall assessment of the outlook for financial stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">By publishing a Financial Stability Review, the ECB pursues three objectives: first, promoting awareness of issues relevant to safeguarding the stability of the euro area financial system and encouraging an informed debate on these; second, providing an overview of sources of risk and vulnerabilities with regard to financial stability; in this way, the review seeks to play a role in preventing crises; and, third, analysing ways of promoting and maintaining a stable financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The scope of the Review is wide, covering the euro area financial system, notably banks, other financial institutions  , capital and money markets and financial infrastructure  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.71,0)">As such, it is the only Report of this kind for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The analysis underpinning the assessment of the financial stability outlook comprises three elements: an evaluation of the robustness of the financial system; an identification of plausible and systemically important risks to euro area financial stability; an assessment of the ability of the financial system to cope with shocks in the event that some combination of the identified risks and vulnerabilities were to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It should be stressed that calling attention to such sources of risk and vulnerability does not mean seeking to identify the most probable outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Rather, it entails highlighting potential and plausible downside risks, even if these are unlikely to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The Review has been prepared with the close involvement of the Banking Supervision Committee of the European System of Central Banks, which is a forum of cooperation among the national central banks and supervisory authorities of the 25 European Union Member States and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The combination of the micro perspectives of supervisors with the macro perspectives of central bankers contributes to making this assessment as wide-ranging as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The Review also serves as the basis of semi-annual financial stability discussions at the ECB Governing Council and therefore represents the common view of the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The Review is organised in four main chapters: first, an overview, setting the scene with a self-contained analysis and assessment; second, an analysis of the macro-financial environment which assesses the financial balances of non-financial sectors of the economy; third, an inspection of the financial system which forms the core of the Review; and, fourth, a section with six special features, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">short articles aimed at providing analytical and contextual underpinnings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.02,0)">The first article deals with measurement challenges related to financial stability analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.14,0)">The second analyses financial market contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.66,0)">The third assesses the financial vulnerability of mortgage-indebted euro area households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The fourth study looks at determinants of euro area banks’ profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.83,0)">The fifth article looks at the effects of the new accounting framework on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The final study looks at the financial stability issues related to central counterparty clearing houses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In addition to the special features, the Review contains 20 boxes as well as a statistical annex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Main areas of vulnerability of the euro area financial system Let me now turn to the substance of the Review and present the main findings of the analysis and assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I start by looking at the main developments in the global macro-financial environment  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.31,0)">II.1.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Global macro finance Global imbalances continued to widen in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The chart on the left of slide 4 shows that among the main economic areas, the United States remains the largest borrower country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.86,0)">However, there have been changes in the composition of the global creditor countries, with the shares of Japan and the euro area diminishing, while China and, in particular, the oil producing countries, have grown in importance in financing the US deficit in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.75,0)">The chart on the right of slide 4 focuses on the evolution of the US deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.3,0)">The total net lending of the US economy reached new post-Bretton-Woods records of 6.5% of GDP in the first quarter of 2005, and narrowed slightly to 6.3% of GDP in the second quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.33,0)">For much of the time since 2000, the main domestic sources of the US current account deficit have been growing fiscal imbalances and heavy household sector borrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">On the other hand, rather atypically, the corporate sector enjoyed a financial surplus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.73,0)">This may not last, however, as the corporate sector begins to leverage again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.59,0)">Overall, while the sustainability of current account positions seems rather unproblematic in the short term, the expansion of imbalances exposes the global financial system to the risk of sharp correction in the medium term, in particular if confidence were to suddenly deteriorate in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.7,0)">An additional significant risk to euro area financial stability during the current year has been the surge in oil prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.5,0)">Slide 5 highlights some of the implications for the global financial system of the rise in oil prices to levels that, in real terms, have remained close to the peaks reached in the late 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.67,0)">While the impact of elevated oil prices on the financial system has thus far been less substantial than previously feared, risk premia in some segments of the global equity markets could nevertheless have been adversely affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.89,0)">The chart on the left plots the real oil price against the US equity market earnings yield premium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The relatively close co-movement between these two variables seems to have carried over to the more recent episode of increasing oil prices, possibly explaining part of the relatively subdued developments in US equity markets in the current year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.64,0)">Regarding the corporate credit markets, in 2005 problems in the US automobile and airline sectors – both of which are sensitive to the level of oil prices – have created periods of short-lived turbulence in credit markets, including the markets for more complex structured credit instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.22,0)">Looking ahead, a key question in credit markets is the likely timing of the turn of the current very benign credit cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.97,0)">The chart on the right in slide 5 shows that the decline in global corporate default rates stabilised at a low level in the first three quarters of 2005 after a very marked decline in 2002-2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Partially reflecting the effect of high oil prices, Moody’s rating agency currently forecasts that global default rates will pick up somewhat in early 2006, heralding less favourable credit conditions to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.39,0)">It should, however, be noted that similar forecasts made at the beginning of 2005 proved to be inaccurate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.89,0)">II.2 Financial markets In the global fixed income markets  , the flattening of yield curves throughout the second and the third quarters of 2005 has been something of a puzzle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">More recently, worries about global inflation, mainly driven by high oil prices, seem to have reversed the decline in long-term bond yields, at least temporarily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.63,0)">The low level of US ten-year bond yields in particular remains a conundrum that is difficult to reconcile with underlying macroeconomic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.79,0)">At the same time, and as a corollary, concerns about the risk of an unexpected and abrupt upturn in these yields have remained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The chart on the top left of slide 6 illustrates the puzzle by plotting the evolution of the US 10-year bond yield against the consensus expectations on US nominal GDP growth ten years ahead, a proxy for the level of bond yields consistent with expected future fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">In “normal” circumstances, the two would be expected to remain rather close to each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.23,0)">The chart shows, however, that for the US, since early 2002 the bond yield has been persistently lower than the expected future growth rate of nominal GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.71,0)">In the euro area, as shown in the chart on the bottom left on slide 6, although the 10-year bond yield has also declined below the 10-year nominal GDP growth expectations, the margin is substantially narrower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.37,0)">The low levels of bond yields can be partly explained by increasing demand by institutional investors, such as insurance companies and pension funds, for long-term bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.01,0)">Ageing populations and increasing private provisioning of pensions in many euro area countries, as well as accounting changes and balance sheet repair, have forced financial institutions to resort to longer-term bonds in order to correct maturity mismatches in their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.98,0)">The chart on the right of slide 6 illustrates how net purchases of long-term bonds relative to quoted shares has sharply diverged since 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.4,0)">Insofar as the declining bond yields reflect such structural factors, the potential for a reversal of the trend, should it happen, could take place more gradually than previously feared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.67,0)">However, it should be noted that other factors have also affected the patterns of global portfolio behaviour, which led to an unusual increase in the net demand for long-term bonds and drove down risk premia and therefore bond yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.01,0)">II.3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The balance sheets of euro area corporations and households Let me now briefly discuss developments in the euro area economic environment  , focusing on developments in the corporate and household sectors that are particularly relevant from the point of view of the outlook for financial intermediaries’ credit portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.16,0)">Starting with the corporate sector, there are signs that earlier weaknesses in demand for external funding by the non-financial corporate sector is coming to an end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This is reflected by the increase in lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">At the same time, reflecting the better financial condition of firms, credit standards by banks to firms have been relaxed somewhat, as shown in the chart on the left on slide 7  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Encouragingly, these developments also extended to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in many euro area countries had faced difficult circumstances over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Overall, euro area corporate sector balance sheets show signs of improvement, after several years of de-leveraging and extensive cost-controlling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.4,0)">Turning to the household sector, the most important development continued to be further rises in house prices in many euro area countries and in the euro area as a whole, as shown in the chart on the right on slide However, prices continued to fall in some countries, while in others, where house prices increased rapidly in the past, prices have shown signs of moderation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.09,0)">Given the relative robustness of household sector balance sheets in the euro area and the still, on average, conservative loan-to-value ratios applied to mortgage lending, more substantial credit risks to financial institutions would materialize only in the currently rather unlikely event of a simultaneous increase in unemployment and a fall in house prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.27,0)">Nevertheless, against the backdrop of signs of further relaxation of credit standards and the possibility of a substantial negative impact of a potential fall in house prices in some euro area countries on their financial systems, the housing market warrants further close monitoring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.73,0)">Financial institutions Consolidated data on the euro area banking sector’s financial results are available for the full year of 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The figures, further supported by non-consolidated data for the first half of 2005, paint a picture of strong profit growth and comfortable solvency ratios  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In 2004, the average return on equity   for euro area domestic banks, the main indicator signalling increased profitability, increased by almost three percentage points from 2003, reaching 10.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">The chart on the left on slide 8 illustrates that in addition to the increase in average profitability, the distribution of ROE for euro area banks shifted in the direction of higher profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The chart shows the proportion of euro area banks’ return on equity – weighted by each country’s total banking assets – in 5% intervals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.51,0)">For example, banks with a ROE falling within the 5-10% interval represented approximately 28% of total euro area banking assets in 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The shift in the distribution of ROE shows that both the best and worst performing banks had become more profitable in 2004 compared to 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.64,0)">Against the background of a rather benign credit environment in the euro area, the aggregate flow of provisions as a share of total assets declined further between 2003 and 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.34,0)">The stock of provisions in euro terms also fell in 2004 from the previous year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.15,0)">Beyond the short-term horizon, the overall low levels of provisioning flows could be questioned as a less benign credit environment could make the situation more difficult for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.97,0)">Possible triggers for a deterioration include an unanticipated sharp rise in short and long-term interest rates, or an unexpected worsening in the macroeconomic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In contrast to the observed changes in provisioning flows as a share of total assets, however, the ratio of provisioning stocks to non-performing loans increased as shown by the chart on the right on slide This mainly reflects an improvement in banks’ asset quality in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It should be kept in mind, however, that the quality of banks’ assets is sensitive to changes in the phase of the credit cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.04,0)">Looking ahead, the low level of provisioning flows could become a problem if the current rather benign credit conditions were to deteriorate and the number of non-performing loans to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Given that lending to the household sector, has, for several years, been the most rapidly growing line of business for banks, the continuing growth of exposures to the household sector is a potential source of increasing credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">However, the quality of credit granted to households tends to be generally higher than that extended to the corporate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">In 2004, the last full year for which figures are available, profitability in the euro area insurance industry improved further, with the exception of the re-insurance sector  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The strengthening of financial positions was mainly driven by strong underwriting results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">Capital bases improved in both the non-life and reinsurance industries in 2004, whereas solvency ratios in the life insurance industry remained broadly unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.91,0)">The chart on the left on slide 9 shows that there continue to be divergent developments among the various sectors of the industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In the life insurance sector, the average ROE increased between 2003 and 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Non-life insurers enjoyed an even more significant improvement in profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.97,0)">By contrast, the reinsurance industry saw a marked decline in profits in 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Profits in the non-life sector were driven by strong underwriting performances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the life insurance sector, lower guaranteed rates of return and cost-cutting supported the results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.18,0)">Re-insurers suffered mainly from falling net investment income and a reduction in risk transfer from the non-life sector to the re-insurance sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.56,0)">The solvency positions of insurers may be broadly measured by the ratio of surplus to net premiums written.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As shown in the right-hand chart on slide 9, in the non-life and re-insurance industries, this ratio rose in 2004 from the previous year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Despite rather subdued profits, the capital base of the reinsurance industry grew as companies limited the amount of dividends distributed to their shareholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.87,0)">In the life insurance industry, there was a slight decline in the solvency ratio in 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.27,0)">Regarding unregulated financial institutions, the risks associated with hedge funds have remained a topical issue in 2005  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The ECB, in collaboration with the BSC  , carried out a survey of EU banks’ exposures to hedge funds, which has been published and is now available on the ECB’s website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The December 2005 Financial Stability Review contains a box summarising the key findings of the survey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The chart on the left on slide 10 shows that according to publicly available data, inflows to the hedge funds sector continued in the first half of 2005, albeit at a decelerating pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.37,0)">The chart on the right on slide 10 illustrates that at least certain hedge fund strategies suffered losses in March-April 2005 owing to the turbulence in the corporate credit markets that was generated by the widely expected downgrades of two large US automakers which subsequently materialised in May.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.79,0)">This weaker performance in hedge fund returns may, at least in part, explain why inflows tapered off somewhat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Overall assessment Having reviewed developments in the key parts of the financial system, the overall assessment of risks to euro area financial stability can be formulated as follows  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">A number of recent positive developments support the judgement that the euro area financial markets, institutions and infrastructures are robust and capable of withstanding shocks: First, the pace of global economic activity has remained rather strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Second, balance sheets of large corporations have improved further, with signs of recovery also extending to the small and medium-sized enterprise sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Third, the balance sheets of euro area banks and insurance companies have also continued to strengthen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.59,0)">At the same time, these positive developments are clouded by the fact that risks and vulnerabilities are also growing  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.96,0)">Global imbalances have continued to widen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.91,0)">In addition, it cannot be excluded that the global hunt for yield could have extended to riskier segments of financial markets, further accentuating the risk of disorderly market corrections as global liquidity is gradually reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.65,0)">High oil prices and rising house prices add to the sectoral risks, creating vulnerabilities to financial institutions’ future performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.62,0)">Finally, if the credit environment turns worse than currently anticipated, the present level of loan-loss provisioning by euro area banks may prove to be insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Overall, with shock-absorption capacities improving, but risks and vulnerabilities rising, the financial stability outlook continues to rest upon a delicate balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">While the probable outcomes could, at this stage, best be described as bi-modal, a positive outcome remains the most likely prospect in the period ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
