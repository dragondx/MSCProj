    <span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)"> The international role of the euro: trends, determinants and prospects Speech by Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the ECBat the Brussels Economic Forum 2008at the panel on “The euro in a rapidly changing international environment”organised by the European Commission Brussels, 15 May 2008 I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, I would first like to thank the European Commission and the organisers of the Brussels Economic Forum for inviting me to this important celebration of the 10th anniversary of the launch of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">It is indeed a privilege and a pleasure for me to participate in this very special event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Many of us here remember vividly the famous words – spoken almost 40 years ago – that “one small step for   man” can be “one giant leap for mankind”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.31,0)">The same event can have a varying degree of significance for different people, depending on their viewpoint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Anniversaries are occasions to take a step back and assess matters from a broader perspective and over an extended time horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">They are occasions for celebrating the accomplishments of the past, as well as for reflecting on perspectives and objectives for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Allow me to make an analogy with the words of Neil Armstrong and say that the ten years since the introduction of the euro may seem like a small step in the long history of the global economy to some people, but they certainly represent a significant leap of progress for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Over the past ten years, the euro has become an important pole of stability in the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The significance of the introduction of the euro has to be assessed first and foremost in terms of its contribution to the stability and growth of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">And the euro’s performance as a currency must be fundamentally judged by its internal stability and credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">At the same time, the single currency of a large economic area inevitably has a significant global role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Our task today is to assess the euro’s international role in a rapidly changing and integrating global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">My remarks will address a number of pertinent issues: the evolution of the international use of the euro over the past ten years and the euro’s current status as an international currency; the key determinants of a currency’s international role and the prospects for the further internationalisation of the euro; and the ECB’s position and the effects of macroeconomic and structural policies on the global role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The evolving international use of the euro The international importance of the euro can be measured and assessed by the role it plays in global financial markets and international trade, the extent of its use by authorities   as a reserve, intervention and anchor currency, and its possible use by the public or firms outside the euro area as a parallel currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">A bird’s eye view of the evolution of the international use of the euro over the past ten years is presented in   An examination of how the international use of the euro has evolved over time complements the abovementioned conclusions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This involves assessing the implications of valuation effects resulting from exchange rate movements on the measurement of its international use and identifying the geographic or regional character of the euro’s international use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Overall, the evolution has been gradual: the share of the euro increased during the first five years following the introduction of the euro and has since remained relatively stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">If we adjust for valuation effects stemming from exchange rate movements  , we see that the overall increase in the euro’s share over the past ten years has been smaller, and its time profile smoother.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.24,0)">When interpreting these figures, it should be borne in mind that no official statistics are available on the currency composition of about one-third of global foreign exchange reserves, since a number of countries with large holdings of reserves – mostly in Asia – do not disclose their composition by currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">It is interesting to note that the share of the euro in the total official foreign exchange reserves held by the emerging market economies that provide the relevant statistics rose from around 18% in 1999 to about 28% at the end of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Similar conclusions are reached with regard to the evolution of the share of the euro in international debt security markets, as shown in   The increase in this share is less pronounced, although still significant, after adjusting for valuation effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">One special characteristic of the international use of the euro is that, so far, it has been concentrated in regions that are geographically close to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This fact reflects political, institutional and economic factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It is not surprising that non-euro area EU countries account for a significant part of euro-denominated debt by non-residents or that the degree of currency substitution is high in the new EU Member States that have not yet adopted the euro or in the EU candidate and potential candidate countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Moreover, some 29 countries   that use the euro as a reference currency for their exchange rate policies are close to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">At the same time, the rise in the share of the euro in international debt securities has also been most pronounced in the new EU Member States and the other non-euro area EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">To sum up, over the past ten years, the euro has established itself as the second most important international currency after the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Its global role in international trade and global financial markets is greater than that of its legacy currencies combined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Its international use has gradually increased over time in most market segments but, in certain markets, it has remained relatively stable in recent years, when adjusted for valuation effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The international role of the euro area is especially strong in neighbouring regions with special political and economic ties to the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Determinants of and prospects for the international role of the euro What are the prospects for the euro’s international role in the coming years?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">To address this question it is useful to recall the key determining factors that are likely to influence the demand for the euro by non-euro area market participants and authorities over time, also taking into account the potential effects of the ongoing and growing economic and financial integration of the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">These key determinants include, first, the size, growth and degree of openness of the euro area economy relative to the rest of the world; second, the size, depth and degree of development of the euro area financial markets, again relative to the markets of countries with international currencies; and, lastly and fundamentally, the attractiveness of the single European currency to non-euro area residents, as determined by its expected internal and external stability over the medium and long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The relative size of the euro area economy and its degree of openness are factors that support the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">With the expected enlargement of the euro area in coming years, the euro area’s GDP will approach that of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The chart also shows that the euro area economy’s degree of openness is significantly higher than that of the United States and has risen over the past eight years, contrary to earlier expectations that the euro area would become an “isolated” trading bloc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Indeed, the euro area is the largest trading bloc in the world, accounting for over 13% of world trade in goods and services in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.45,0)">The potential growth of the euro area has been lower than that of the United States over the past decade, but the relative economic growth prospects seem more favourable as a result of the positive impact of reforms in Europe that have positively and significantly affected employment growth, and the rate of labour utilisation and, to a lesser extent, productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Clearly, the implementation of further reforms will be crucial for enhancing the growth potential and economic dynamism of the euro area economy in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The overall size of the euro area’s financial system in nominal terms is comparable to that of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Nevertheless, it less well developed, as measured by several indicators of financial developments, for example the ratio of total market capitalisation   to GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">At the same time, the efficiency of the euro area’s financial system has improved significantly since the adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Indeed, the euro has contributed to the integration of financial markets in the euro area, which has increased their liquidity and efficiency, and made the euro more attractive to international investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Policy initiatives by the European Commission and the ECB aim at fostering further integration and the development of the euro area’s financial system, which will support the international use of the euro and will have positive feedback effects on the development and efficiency of the euro area’s financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Thus, the further integration and development of the euro area financial system and the internationalisation of the euro are processes that can be expected to be mutually reinforcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The process of financial globalisation and the rapid integration of emerging markets into the world economy, as illustrated in   There are other determining factors, and the effects of some of them imply that changes in the international use of a currency are likely to be very gradual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me point to two such factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">First, as historical experience suggests, inertia and the advantages of incumbency in various markets imply that change in the international role of a currency is likely to be very gradual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Network externalities favour the use of one currency for certain financial and real sector transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">For example, the US dollar serves as a vehicle currency in foreign exchange markets, with most trades executed via the US dollar, even when neither of the two currencies exchanged is the US dollar, mainly due to the superior liquidity and thus lower costs involved in trading against the US dollar than for other currency pairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Similarly, prices in international commodity markets are quoted in US dollars, ensuring transparency on a global scale and omitting costly pricing in two or more currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Second, in the absence of a significant shock triggering an abrupt change in the international use of one currency, the sheer size of stocks relative to flows or turnover is likely to mean a gradual adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Thus, changes in the currency composition in major market segments are likely to be gradual, because the respective stocks tend to be large, at least if we assume that such changes will occur only through a currency diversification of the respective flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For example, the stock of global foreign exchange reserves at the end of 2007 amounted to USD 6.4 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.53,0)">The respective average quarterly flow, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">additional reserve accumulation by central banks in 2007 was around USD 340 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Even if we assumed for illustrative purposes that from now on 50% of newly accumulated reserves would be invested in euro-denominated assets  , the share of the euro in the stock of global foreign exchange reserves would rise only gradually, as illustrated in   What role do macroeconomic and structural policies play in determining the euro’s international potential and prospects?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.41,0)">And, more specifically, what is the likely impact of the ECB’s monetary policy and the performance of its other tasks on the attractiveness of the euro as an international currency?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The position of the ECB on the international role of the euro has been clearly stated from the start.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The ECB considers the global use of the euro as the outcome of a market-driven process that reflects all the factors influencing the demand by global market participants and non-euro area public authorities for the functions the euro performs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.08,0)">Therefore, the ECB takes a neutral stance and does not directly promote or hinder the international use of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">At the same time, the ECB may indirectly support the euro’s international role by preserving price stability in the euro area and by performing other tasks that contribute to the integration, development and the safeguarding of the stability of the euro area’s financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">When international investors and savers choose the euro as their preferred international currency, they express their confidence in the ECB’s ability to preserve the purchasing power of the single currency and in the ECB’s credible commitment to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The pursuit of sound fiscal policies by the euro area countries, and the implementation of reforms that enhance the growth potential and dynamism of the euro area economy, and foster the further integration and development of Europe’s financial markets are also important for supporting the euro’s international attractiveness and preserving confidence in its external value over the longer run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The EU’s fiscal policy framework contributes to the conduct of sound budgetary policies that support the stability-oriented single monetary policy and help establish favourable conditions for sustained growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">International market participants are aware of the importance of the effective functioning of the fiscal policy framework for the long-term stability and growth of the euro area’s economy, which underpin the relative international attractiveness of its currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Moreover, the implementation of structural reforms is essential to reduce the gap between the euro area and the United States with regard to productivity growth, the level of labour utilisation and the degree of financial development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In this way, the relative potential growth performance of the euro area economy will be strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">As the recent experience in European countries has demonstrated, reforms are paying off by contributing to significant employment growth and productivity gains, and there is growing acceptance by the public of such structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Concluding remarks In conclusion, I would like to make two final points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">First, the longer-term potential of the euro as an international currency will depend on the relative performance of the euro area economy and the euro’s stability and credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The ECB is committed to preserving price stability and the prospects for enhanced efficiency and higher longer-term growth in the euro area are improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">The policies of the Federal Reserve System and the US economic authorities also aim at price stability and strong sustained growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.96,0)">It is therefore difficult to assess the longer-term effects of economic policies and performances on the relative role of the euro and the US dollar as international currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Other determining factors will also play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The likely outcome is the coexistence of two strong international currencies in the longer run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Second, a further expansion of the euro’s international role and greater integration and development of the euro area’s financial markets can be expected to positively contribute to global macroeconomic and financial stability, as a result of the impact of the euro area’s stability-oriented monetary policy and increased international risk diversification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">These observations highlight the importance of strengthening the cooperation between the Eurosystem and major central banks in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.52,0)">Constant exchange rate figures are expressed in exchange rates prevailing at the end of the last available observation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.86,0)">As a result, current and constant exchange rate figures are by construction the same for the last observation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">40 countries, if we include the countries of the CFA Frank Zone in Western Africa.</span>
