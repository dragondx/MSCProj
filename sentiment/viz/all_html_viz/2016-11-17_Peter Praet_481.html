    <span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)"> The future of global financial integration Remarks by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Global Research Forum on International Macroeconomics and Finance, Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 17 November 2016 I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.98,0)">Backlash against financial globalization since the global economic and financial crisis  Financial globalization was a salient phenomenon of the past three decades, but since the financial crisis of 2007-2009 there are increasing signs of a backlash against globalization.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.87,0)">The evidence for such a trend reversal is mixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.57,0)">Quantity-based measures of global financial integration, such as gross external assets relative to world output, have flattened out, and would merely point to a pause.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.66,0)">Flow measures provide a gloomier picture: international capital flows are now down to half their pre-crisis levels relative to world output, and are especially weak among mature economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Internationally active banks have increased domestic lending faster than foreign lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Several emerging markets have erected barriers to global finance and introduced controls against capital inflows and, more recently, outflows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Price-based measures of global financial integration, meanwhile, present a different picture: international equity market co-movements, for example, remain strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">By some estimates, they remain as high as ever in more than a century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.35,0)">It is not just the extent of financial globalization, which might have changed since the financial crisis, though.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Its perceived benefits and costs in academic and policy debates have changed, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Before the crisis several studies already called for a “reappraisal” of the net benefits of financial globalization.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This has taken place along two main dimensions:   re-assessing the stability of capital flows, and   re-examining whether financial integration leads to a productive allocation of savings and to agglomeration effects in certain geographic areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">As regards the first dimension, the notion that financial integration which is based on long-term instead of short-term capital flows is more resilient has become increasingly persuasive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">For the second, it has been recognised that financial integration typically only delivers lasting positive effects on growth if countries meet certain thresholds of institutional development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.89,0)">In the absence of sufficient institutional development, capital flows would most likely be used unproductively, feeding unsustainable lending booms and encouraging excessive short-term capital inflows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.09,0)">This can in turn leave countries vulnerable to sudden stops once optimism fades due to local or global shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Indeed financial cycles tend to have a global component, and hence the discussion about financial globalisation has evolved into one about the “global financial cycle”, which is driven by US monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.12,0)">The assumption is that non-US central banks have lost their ability to influence domestic long-term interest rates, even in the presence of flexible exchange rates, due to the existence of “US-driven” global financial cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.13,0)">As a result, the classic trilemma  may have morphed into a dilemma between financial openness and monetary policy autonomy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.05,0)">In addition to risks related to unsustainable lending booms, which can be fueled by capital flows, policy makers and academics recently also stressed risks stemming from disruptive capital outflows, which can endanger financial stability, for example if large amounts of bank deposits are pulled out of a country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In the context of this debate on financial integration, academic papers on the welfare optimality of taxation of international capital flows have also thrived since the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.24,0)">Moreover, the standard international policy consensus on financial globalization has been shattered by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">For example, the IMF adopted in 2012 an institutional view that said temporary and targeted capital flow management measures can be useful in certain circumstances, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">when the room for manoeuvre for macroeconomic adjustment is limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The Fund is now reviewing this institutional view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">It is expected that the effectiveness of capital flow management measures, which have been recently used in emerging and some advanced economies, will be assessed in a balanced way, taking into account all intended and unintended effects, which such measures may generate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In parallel, the OECD is reviewing its code of liberalization of capital movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">With the review, the OECD aims to facilitate collective action by boosting transparency and shared understandings on good practices related to managing and liberalising capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A particular area of interest is the treatment of capital flow measures that are used as macro-prudential measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.96,0)">For policy makers, this is important since at times there may be tradeoffs between financial integration and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Effective financial risk sharing rests on the soundness of institutions and policy rules As part of this policy discussion, I would like to underline that openness to international capital flows should continue to help diversify country-specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">This would help to smooth cross-border consumption between good and bad states of the world through international borrowing and lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Admittedly, the economic magnitude of gains from financial risk sharing remains debatable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In monetary unions, financial risk sharing remains an essential channel for leveling out the effect of asymmetric shocks across regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Risk-sharing traditionally works through two main channels: cross-border lending to households and companies; and cross-border holdings of productive and financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">In a monetary union like the euro area, which has no central fiscal authority, both channels should have contributed to containing the fallouts from economic shocks in member states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.74,0)">What we have experienced is the opposite: financial flows amplified the crisis when some euro area countries faced a sudden st  A.  , “Do surges in international capital inflows influence the likelihood of banking crises?” Economic Journal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In: Jackson Hole Economic Symposium 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">According to the trilemma, in a financially integrated world, fixed exchange rates export the monetary policy of the centre country to the periphery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The corollary is that if there are free capital flows, it is possible to have independent monetary policies only by having the exchange rate float; and conversely, that floating exchange rates enable monetary policy independence  ).</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">g. Olivier Jeanne and Anton Korinek   “Excessive   403-407 and Emmanuel Farhi and Ivan Werning  , “Dilemma not Trilemma?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Capital Controls and Exchange Rates with   569-605.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Under the IMF new institutional view, CFMs should not substitute for warranted macroeconomic adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Circumstances which allow for CFMs on capital inflows include for example a situation in which the economy is overheating, the exchange rate is overvalued and reserves are at adequate levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.55,0)">Similarly, CFMs could be applied on capital outflows if the economy is stagnating, FX exposures are high, and reserve levels are inadequate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">In many studies gains are of second order of magnitude as financial integration enables a reduction of consumption volatility but does not affect output  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">One estimate suggests that the standard deviation of income growth uncertainty is reduced through financial markets by as much as 35% across U.S. states  , “Risk Sharing Within The United States: What Do Financial Markets And Fiscal Federalism Accomplish?,” The Review of Economics and Statistics, 83 , pp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.62,0)">688-698.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.88,0)">According to a recent IMF paper, cross-country risk sharing in the euro area is not only more limited  , but also falls sharply in severe downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">It also suggests that risk sharing is particularly fostered through various forms of equity holdings, underlining the importance of the capital markets union and its emphasis on equity markets.</span>
