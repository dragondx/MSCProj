    <h3> Speaker: Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)"> European Financial Integration and the Financial System Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB Third conference of the Monetary Stability Foundation “Challenges to the financial system – ageing and low growth”Frankfurt am Main, 6-7 July 2006   Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to thank the Deutsche Bundesbank for inviting me to participate in the panel of this conference on “Challenges in the financial system – ageing and low growth”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I will speak today about “European financial integration and the financial system” and the implications of financial integration for economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.26,0)">European economic and political integration is now at a crossroads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.02,0)">The rejection of the European constitution by the people of the Netherlands and France, two countries that were among the founding fathers of the European Union, sent the strong signal that European citizens do not fully perceive the benefits of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Although Europe has brought the ultimate gift of political stability and peace to the people of Europe, Europeans are craving for economic prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Economic growth and prosperity were among the goals of the founding fathers from the inception of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">As early as 1955, Belgium, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands declared in Messina that the establishment of a united Europe through, among other things, the creation of a common market, “seems indispensable if Europe is to improve steadily the living standard of the population”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The desire to create a common market has since driven Europe’s economic integration, which reached an apex with Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.93,0)">Where then have we failed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Why has economic prosperity still not reached its full potential?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.93,0)">I will argue today that the insufficient degree of integration of some parts of the European financial system is one reason why growth and prosperity are lagging behind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Financial integration has been an important element of EMU since the very beginning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In April 1989 the Delors Report provided a roadmap for the introduction of EMU in three stages, including the creation of a monetary institution, the European System of Central Banks  , with at its centre the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The Delors Report was adopted by the Madrid European Council, which decided to launch the first stage of EMU on 1 July 1990.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">To highlight the implications of this decision, I would like to quote the Delors Report on the first stage of EMU: “In the monetary field, the focus would be on removing all obstacles to financial integration and on intensifying cooperation and the coordination of monetary policies   Through the approval and enforcement of the necessary Community Directives, the objective of a single financial area in which all monetary and financial instruments circulate freely and banking, securities and insurance services are offered uniformly throughout the area would be fully implemented”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">While the Delors Report envisioned a fully integrated financial area as a precondition for the introduction of the single currency, Stage One was far from complete when Stage Three was implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.8,0)">Why did financial integration lose its prominence in the run-up to EMU?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There are two basic reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">First, the implementation of the idea of financial integration was limited to the elimination of capital mobility restrictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Financial integration was based on the Council Directive adopted on 24 June 1988  , which required the abolishment of restrictions on movements of capital between the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.15,0)">However, legal harmonisation was set aside, with the result that agents dealing with a financial instrument or service in two different countries could be subject to two different sets of rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.9,0)">The second reason for financial integration’s loss of prominence was the broad focus on the achievement of a single market, mixed with the belief that financial integration would almost automatically follow once the euro was introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This belief proved to be correct only for some segments of the financial system, particularly the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I would like to touch on three questions in my presentation today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.48,0)">First, what is the current state of financial integration in Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Second, what is the contribution of the financial system to growth in Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">And finally, what can Europe do to strengthen the financial system?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.06,0)">What is the current state of financial integration in Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.28,0)">For some parts of the European financial system, integration remains below potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This realistic conclusion is based on the information gained via the monitoring framework that the ECB has built up to assess the process of financial integration in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This framework draws on quantitative indicators of financial integration developed by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The first set of indicators was published last year   and will be updated in September 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In a nutshell, the indicators show that financial integration is very strong in the money market, mostly because of EMU;   it has progressed significantly in government bond markets;   it has improved in the corporate bond market;   and it is slow but progressing in the equity market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The wave of mergers and acquisitions we have observed in the last 20 years was mainly a domestic development – although very recently there has been a significant increase in cross-border M&A deals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Financial integration is unfortunately much less advanced in a range of banking market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Retail banking is one of the most important financial markets in which to convince European citizens that Europe is beneficial for them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Any results from integrating these markets will be tangible proof that Europe is part of people’s daily life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">We should therefore strive to achieve a higher degree of financial integration in the retail banking markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Before giving you concrete examples of how this could be achieved in practice, let me now first explain why an efficient and integrated European financial system can foster economic growth in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">What can the financial system contribute to economic growth in Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">When referring to economic efficiency, the most important Community objective is the achievement of sustainable economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What is the link between financial integration and economic growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To help us understand this link I would first like to introduce some concepts which draw on work done by ECB staff.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We view the financial system as being composed of institutions, markets and infrastructures, through which households, corporations and governments obtain funding for their activities and invest their savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The main role of a financial system is to allocate savings to the most profitable real investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The performance of a financial system is closely connected to the concept of financial efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We define financial efficiency as the condition under which resources available in a financial system are allocated towards the most valuable investment opportunities at the lowest possible costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.05,0)">A financial system is the more efficient the better it overcomes a number of frictions, such as asymmetric information, differing investment objectives and the dispersion of capital across investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">It is clear that a more efficient financial system can promote economic growth by accelerating the allocation of capital to better investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Having defined financial efficiency I now turn to the concept of financial development, or financial modernisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This is the process of innovation and organisational improvement in the financial system that reduces asymmetric information, increases the completeness of markets and contracting possibilities, reduces transaction costs and increases competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">There is clearly a strong positive link between the development and the efficiency of a financial system and its contribution to productivity and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">For example, many new financial instruments improve risk sharing between agents in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Also greater financial development allows countries to adopt new production technology faster and stimulates growth through a process of “creative destruction” by enhancing firms’ entry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Finally, let me also give the ECB’s definition of the concept of financial integration: we consider the market for a given set of financial instruments or services to be fully integrated when all potential market participants in such a market   are subject to a single set of rules when they decide to deal with those financial instruments or services,   have equal access to this set of financial instruments or services, and   are treated equally when they operate in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In regions such as the European Union or the euro area, the integration of the financial systems of the different countries is of particular relevance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.77,0)">The reason is that a fragmentation of financial systems across countries normally reduces the efficiency of the area-wide financial system, as it will constrain the range of financing sources and investment opportunities, limit scale economies and negate possible liquidity advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Incidentally, the ECB’s definition of financial integration is very much in line with the issues raised by Professor Guiso in his presentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.05,0)">If law is harmonised, agents face a single set of rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Hence, our first condition is satisfied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However this does not mean that financial integration follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Indeed, legal harmonisation does not guarantee fulfilment of our third condition, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">that market participants with the same relevant characteristics are treated equally, since – and allow me to use Professor Guiso’s words here – “differences in non-legal enforcement – such as norms of behaviour, reciprocal trust – can segment markets geographically”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">As I argued, there is a strong conceptual link between financial efficiency, financial integration, financial development and economic efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The performance of a financial system, and notably its efficiency, is influenced by its fundamental features in conjunction with the processes of integration and financial development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The fundamental features of a financial system include i) the legal system, financial regulation and corporate governance, ii) the financial structure – the balance between markets and intermediaries iii) market infrastructure   and iv) other conditioning features, such as social norms, religion and political systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">However, the link between economic efficiency and financial efficiency – although conceptually unambiguous – needs to have an empirical underpinning in order to be of direct policy relevance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Not surprisingly, empirical research has established a strong connection between financial development, certain forms of financial integration, productivity and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The general effects of financial development and financial integration on growth are quantitatively important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">It was found that financial development exerts a disproportionately positive effect in industries that for technological reasons depend heavily on external finance   and have good growth opportunities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Raising the level of financial development may result in an increase in firm value-added growth of approximately 0.5 to 0.9 percentage point in the countries that made up the EU before 1 May 2004  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Also, research by London Economics   found that the benefits of integration in the European bond and equity markets would be equal to around 1% of GDP over a 10 year period, or approximately €100 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">A strand of the literature that is most relevant for new EU Member States is that concentrating on large-scale cross-country analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">These studies investigate the determinants of economic growth and its subcomponents   and they suggest that economies with more liquid capital markets and developed banking systems grow on average more rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In particular, growth accelerates by approximately 0.8 percentage point in countries which have adopted measures to enhance their integration into global financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.16,0)">However, the most important empirical findings are those pertaining to retail banking, since, as I suggested in my review of the state of financial integration in the euro area, retail banking is still among the least integrated parts of the European financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Therefore, the most relevant strand of the literature for the ongoing European financial integration process is that which studies the results of bank sector deregulation in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Moreover, these studies investigate the growth effects of financial reforms in a developed country quite similar to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.13,0)">Between 1970 and 1994, 38 US states removed restrictions on branching, and between 1978 and 1992, almost all states removed restrictions on intrastate bank ownership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Studies that quantify the growth and productivity effects of banking deregulation in the United States in the period 1970 to 1995 show that annual average state gross product increased after the reforms by approximately 1 percentage point  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The evidence suggests that the growth gains stemmed from enhanced productivity rather than from increased investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">This work is particularly relevant for the ongoing banking and financial system integration that is taking place in the EU and, as I already pointed out, should encourage us to go further in the integration of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Very recent and still preliminary ECB research seems to suggest first evidence in favour of a specific channel through which the efficiency of the financial system can promote productivity and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">This research suggests that overall capital market size explains the speed with which high and low-income economies reallocate capital from declining industries to industries with good growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Overall market size, which is itself a measure of financial system development, is explained by a variety of variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Particularly interesting, for example, is the fact that the public ownership of banks as well as bank concentration are important determinants of market size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This result also seems to hold when the analysis focuses on industrial countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.9,0)">Therefore, it seems that in countries with more concentrated banking sectors, declining industries will retain capital for longer while rising industries will have more difficulty finding the funding needed for the investment to support their growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">A similar result is also found for public ownership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.51,0)">Too high a share of public banks prevents the financial system from speedily reallocating capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In other words, the higher the market share of public banks, the slower capital is reallocated to promising industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In conclusion, an efficient financial system is necessary for Europe to deliver the highest economic growth, and considerable effort should be made to further integrate our retail banking markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">What can be done in the European financial system to foster economic growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">The goal is crystal clear: we want an efficient financial system capable of delivering all of Europe’s economic growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">I have argued that there are strong theoretical and empirical reasons to believe that a higher degree of financial integration in those parts where it is still lagging behind will foster financial market development and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">However, the creation of an integrated financial system obviously presents challenges of its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">For example, financial and economic actors need to be submitted to the same regulatory framework; standards need to be harmonised, so that economic actors face a level playing field in financial services; technologies need to be updated to offer interoperability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">In addition to providing a framework for the adoption of a single set of rules, the European Commission has encouraged a market-driven approach to financial integration by promoting competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Competition induces a selection process among providers of financial services that generally ensures that only the most efficient survive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Competition is therefore the mechanism that will structure financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">However, a prerequisite for the market-led process is that closed national markets are opened up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This is especially true in the field of retail banking, which was identified as a key sector in the post- Financial Services Action Plan   phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As you know, the European Commission issued a White Paper on Financial Services Policy 2005-2010 at the end of 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">It targeted, among other things, the further integration of retail markets through ongoing or future projects, thus complementing the FSAP of the past five years, which focused mainly on the wholesale markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">However, the integration process in retail banking, induced by competitive forces, will only be successful if incumbent firms are open to playing the market game, and if purely national interests are left aside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Two examples illustrate the considerable room for improving financial integration in retail banking markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Retail payment services: SEPA The introduction of the single currency in 1999 was only the first step towards a single payments area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">In 2002, the European banking community envisaged that the Single Euro Payments Area – or SEPA – project would be completed by the end of 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">SEPA offers great benefits for each and every European citizen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">It will remove all national barriers to payments within the euro area, allowing potential economies of scale as well as a customer experience similar to the situation in national markets today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">A cardholder should be able to use his or her card in the same way throughout the euro area without differentiation based on the country of issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And a customer should be able to choose a bank anywhere in the euro area and make cashless payments from a single payment account using SEPA credit transfers and direct debits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This requires that the national technical standards, contractual provisions and business practices that currently fragment national markets are replaced by SEPA standards, provisions and practices, which would facilitate the development of SEPA-wide demand   and supply  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.45,0)">This will clearly entail costs and open up competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.94,0)">While the majority of banks now actively support the SEPA project, some have expressed concerns that the SEPA project will impact negatively on their profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.86,0)">As a consequence, these banks are cautiously slowing down adoption of the SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.69,0)">Banks are expressing a legitimate concern, as they argue that the SEPA would negatively affect the revenue side of payment business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">However, the possibility of improving the cost side must also be taken into account, and the potential cost savings are certainly considerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.82,0)">There are currently large national variations in the revenues that banks generate from their payment businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.06,0)">When the SEPA eliminates national barriers, it will foster greater competition and, as a result, exert downward pressure not only on banks’ revenues, but also on processing costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In addition, general and large-scale standardisation will result in better opportunities to share development costs and software products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The overall gains are likely to compensate the short-term losses of some of the market players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">The European mortgage market My second example of the considerable gains offered by financial integration in retail markets is the European mortgage market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The importance of this retail market segment is evident from its size: the outstanding volume of more than €4 trillion in residential mortgage debt in the EU corresponds to around 40% of EU GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.35,0)">I mentioned earlier that the dispersion of interest rates on lending for house purchase across the different countries of the euro area has not shown a clear declining trend over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Furthermore, if one compares the euro area mortgage market with its US counterpart, it is possible to see that, over the past three years, the cross-country dispersion of rates in the euro area was greater than the cross-regional dispersion of mortgage rates in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.49,0)">All this suggests that the euro area mortgage market is not yet fully integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Given the size of this market and given that European citizens are its first customers, it is urgent that progress is made in integrating the market at the EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">There are important gains to be made from the full integration of the EU mortgage market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">It was estimated that full integration would raise EU GDP by 0.7% and EU private consumption by 0.5% in 2015, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.82,0)">ten years from now  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The Eurosystem contributed to the European Commission’s Green paper on Mortgage Credit in the EU within the framework of the public consultation on this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">It stressed, among other things, that a growing share of mortgage lending is funded on the capital markets via the issuance of mortgage-covered bonds and mortgage-backed securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.54,0)">Nevertheless, secondary markets, particularly in mortgage loans, remain fragmented due to differences in the legal, tax and regulatory frameworks that prevail in the various jurisdictions and to the heterogeneity of the standards and practices adopted by market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.62,0)">Moreover, there are certain specific impediments to the cross-border origination and transfer of mortgage loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.23,0)">As a consequence, secondary market liquidity, particularly in mortgage loans, remains low, and economies of scale and cross-country diversification benefits have not yet been fully reaped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Fostering the development of a pan-European funding market by facilitating the transfer of mortgage loan portfolios across borders could possibly help to promote primary market integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">If the liquidity of the secondary mortgage market is increased, primary mortgage lenders are able to get better deals there, all other things being equal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">This, together with competition, should have the effect of reducing the rates offered to borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Conclusions Ladies and Gentlemen, let me conclude by briefly summarising the main points of my remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Economic growth and prosperity was one of the main goals for the establishment of the European Union, as stated in the Messina declaration of 1955.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.52,0)">Even in Messina, some believed that integration would not work out, such as the British delegate who decided to leave the conference, saying: "I leave because you will never agree, and if you agree you will never implement it, and if you implement it, it will be a disaster".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.15,0)">Fortunately, we did not listen and delivered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The next hurdle is now financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">We have to prove the sceptics and the citizens of Europe that it will work out and will bring a higher potential for economic growth to Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Our efforts should now concentrate on, among other things, the integration of retail markets, as illustrated by the examples of the SEPA and the mortgage market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">There are still large economic gains to be made from a financially integrated euro area, and we should therefore all work towards this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.01,0)">Europe will not deliver on its growth promises without an efficient and integrated financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
