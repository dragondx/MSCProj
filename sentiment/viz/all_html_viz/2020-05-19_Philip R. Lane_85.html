    <span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)"> Pandemic central banking: the monetary stance, market stabilisation and liquidity Remarks by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Institute for Monetary and Financial Stability Policy Webinar, 19 May 2020 19 May 2020   In my recent blog post, I described the range of scenarios that have been developed by ECB staff to support the analysis of the near-term and medium-term macroeconomic dynamics in the context of the coronavirus   crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">,   I also explained the current monetary policy of the ECB and outlined our approach to setting the future course of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">My remarks today aim to reinforce these points by presenting some additional empirical evidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Macroeconomic outlook   Still, the 1 May scenarios provide an excellent framework for understanding the environment facing policymakers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.41,0)">In all scenarios, the current quarter represents the trough of the crisis, with a cumulative decline in the range of 10 to 20 percent of GDP since the start of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In terms of quarterly performance, a significant rebound is expected over the summer in line with the removal of the most severe lockdown measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.16,0)">However, the scenarios differ in terms of the duration and severity of virus-related restrictions on economic activity and the behaviour of households and firms in the rest of 2020 and throughout 2021.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.6,0)">In all scenarios, a deep recession is envisaged: in the severe scenario, real GDP would fall by 12 percent in 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Although “forced saving” during the lockdown is surely contributing to the increase in household saving, it is plausible that the precautionary motive will remain significant so long as virus-related uncertainty persists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.65,0)">Elevated uncertainty may also hamper investment prospects for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.94,0)">The private investment rate is forecast to drop this year after trending upwards since 2013, and next year it is expected to remain below the level recorded in 2019  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The fiscal response to the COVID-19 crisis   is helping to cushion the impact of the shock: the euro area general government balance is projected to reach a deficit of 8.5 percent of GDP this year  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Our negative policy rates and our forward guidance on the expected path of policy rates anchor short to medium-term risk-free rates, while our asset purchases and forward guidance on reinvestment steer long-term rates by extracting duration risk from the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.63,0)">The set of monetary policy measures currently in place underpins a risk-free yield curve   rates) that is at record low levels  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Looking just at the decisions we have taken since March, the additional €120 billion APP purchase envelope for 2020 and the PEPP contribute to a further easing of ten-year rates by lowering the term premium by more than 10 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The total effect of these decisions on longer-term interest rates is likely to be even more substantial, given that the PEPP not only works through the well-known channels of duration extraction and portfolio rebalancing, but also addresses risks to transmission in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.83,0)">To the extent that this lowers risk premia, interest rates in the euro area have declined even more strongly as a result of our decisions compared with plausible counterfactual scenarios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.72,0)">Market stabilisation Once investors absorbed the full implications of the pandemic crisis and sought to rebalance portfolios, market liquidity in securities markets dried up and investors looked for safe havens in the context of revisions to future prospects and intrinsically high uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">A marked tightening of overall financial conditions in the euro area   took hold with the deepening of the coronavirus crisis  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.12,0)">The fall in stock prices, the increase in market-based financing costs for firms and   the appreciation of the euro contributed to the tightening that took place between mid-February and mid-March  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This was also evident in the equity and corporate bond markets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">It was also reflected in an increase in the average spread of sovereign yields relative to the OIS curve  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In the context of a monetary union, the absence of currency risk means that flight-to-safety dynamics have an intrinsic cross-border element, which primarily takes the form of reallocations across sovereign bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.56,0)">In view of the central role of sovereign yields as benchmarks in pricing assets and setting lending rates, non-fundamental volatility in sovereign spreads impairs the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In this context, the PEPP announcement acted as a stabilising force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The announcement of the PEPP has successfully halted the tightening in financial conditions and contributed to a partial reversal in the trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The embedded flexibility of the PEPP, which allows for fluctuations in the distribution of purchase flows over time, across asset classes and among jurisdictions, has been a crucial element in fostering its effective market stabilisation function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Market stabilisation has also enabled the resumption of issuance in the debt securities markets: corporate bond issuance by investment grade-rated firms picked up noticeably after the PEPP announcement, as did commercial paper issuance by non-financial corporations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This reflects an important aspect of the PEPP compared to the APP: under the PEPP, we have expanded the maturity range of our private sector purchases to capture the market for non-financial commercial paper, which was at risk of freezing up at the beginning of March.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">These developments highlight that purchases under the PEPP have provided crucial support to market-based funding conditions for companies in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Central bank liquidity and credit provision Especially in an uncertain macro-financial environment, access to central bank liquidity on generous terms and over long tenors supports the maintenance of credit provision by the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Our longer-term refinancing operations include both unconditional and targeted programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The former provides a liquidity backstop to banks and ensures the smooth functioning of money markets, while the latter support the provision of medium-term credit to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.88,0)">For many companies, the lockdown measures have meant a rapid decline in revenues, while their expenses   still fall due.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.93,0)">In order to avoid viable firms going out of business for lack of liquidity, it is important that banks provide sufficient credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Early evidence from monetary aggregates shows a very large increase in money growth in March: the annual growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 stood at 7.5 percent, 2 percentage points higher than in February  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This is by far the largest monthly increase since the creation of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">In absolute terms, the monthly flow was €323 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">For comparison, the largest monthly flows until now were recorded in March 2007 and October 2008 at around €120 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Similar developments were observed in the narrow monetary aggregate M1.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This aggregate continues to drive money developments, reflecting the persistently low remuneration environment and the current high level of economic uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The annual growth rate of M1 increased to 10.3 percent, up from 8.1 percent in February  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">4 percent in March, up from 3.0 percent in February  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.35,0)">By contrast, the annual growth rate of loans to households moderated somewhat: it declined to 3.4 percent, down from 3.7 percent in February.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.41,0)">The very different lending flows between firms and households in March reflect the nature of the policy approaches to supporting these two sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In the case of firms, policy support has been mainly channelled via the banking sector, largely in the form of government-guaranteed credit and central bank measures to support credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">By contrast, direct fiscal support in the form of automatic stabilisers such as unemployment benefits or short-time working schemes, rather than bank credit, has constituted the backbone of the policy actions aimed at supporting the household sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.86,0)">Although credit standards for loans to enterprises tightened in the first quarter of 2020  , the degree of tightening was very mild compared to the credit squeeze that amplified the financial and sovereign debt crises between 2008 and 2012  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">We continuously examine each of our measures   to assess whether these are still adequately calibrated and appropriately sized to provide the necessary degree of accommodation in this uncertain economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Accordingly, we are fully prepared to further adjust our instruments if warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">This includes increasing the size of the PEPP and adjusting its composition, by as much as necessary and for as long as needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.06,0)">European Central Bank
