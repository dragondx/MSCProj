    <h3> Speaker: Eugenio Domingo Solans </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)"> First balance and further challenges for the euro Eugenio Domingo Solans, Member of the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Speech at UNICE, Brussels, 10 June 1999 Thank you for inviting me to the meeting of the Economic and Financial Committee of UNICE.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">It is an honour for me to attempt to draw some lessons from first months of existence of the euro and the ECB, and to discuss future challenges with you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Although it is obviously too early to make an accurate balance - the euro has been in existence for hardly six months and the ECB for hardly a year - I shall try to draw some conclusions on the ECB's objectives and its monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I shall then continue with the implementation of the ECB's monetary policy, our statistics and the reaction of the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">THE OBJECTIVES OF MONETARY POLICY I should like to draw your attention first to the word "objectives" in plural.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The ECB certainly has a primary objective: "price stability".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">However, Article 105.1 of the Maastricht Treaty adds that "without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community as laid down in Article 2."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Among other objectives, Article 2 states that the Community shall promote a "sustainable and non-inflationary growth" and "a high level of employment and social protection".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">It seems clear that, as a matter of priority, the ECB must focus its decisions towards the objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In addition, and without prejudice to this aim of stability, the ECB also has responsibilities as regards economic growth, employment and social protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.72,0)">General, conditional and secondary responsibilities, if you like, but responsibilities nevertheless.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.39,0)">As to the relation between monetary policy and growth, there is an important question which needs to be analysed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Should the ECB consider economic growth only as a sub-product of stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">I am convinced that the best contribution that the ECB can make to economic growth is to create an environment for stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I do believe that there is no better "fertiliser" for economic growth than price stability and that nothing is more refractory for economic growth than inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">However, provided that stability exists, monetary policy should create the best economic conditions for exploiting the growth potential of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">ANALYSIS OF INFLATION AND MONETARY CONDITIONS Analysing the current situation, we see no risks for the primary objective of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Inflation remains subdued in the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Underlying inflation declined from 1,1% in March to 1% in April, and the medium-term prospects for inflation are satisfactory, well within our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.81,0)">There is some divergence in the inflation of individual countries, but this is a normal characteristic of monetary unions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">In the euro area the gap between the highest inflation rate and the lowest inflation rate has remained broadly stable in the last year at around 2.6 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.75,0)">This is mainly due to the differences in the economic cycle and to the different interest rate levels, which had prevailed in the euro-area economies before they were all merged to a single interest rate in December last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.67,0)">To take another example of monetary union, the four main regions of the United States have maintained a gap of around 1.4 percentage points in their inflation rates in the last 30 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To sum up, there will always be differences in inflation rates among regions or countries in a monetary union, but these differences will be limited in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">The current monetary developments also show that there is no risk for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.66,0)">The 5% increase in the three-month moving average of the 12-month growth rates of M3, covering the period from February to April 1999, is in line with the 4 Â½ reference value for money growth  , and is lower than its value last month  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Furthermore, the developments of M3 should be observed with care because of the general Lucas critique and the specific uncertainties surrounding the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This is why there is not only one pillar for the ECB's strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.27,0)">The euro area yield curve has become steeper reflecting a partial spillover of the sharp increase in long-term bond yields in the U.S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.94,0)">Nevertheless, long-term bond yields in the euro area remain low by historical standards, signalling the markets' expectations of low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">IMPLEMENTATION OF MONETARY POLICY The instruments used by the ECB to conduct monetary policy are functioning correctly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Indeed, the wide range of monetary policy instruments at the ECB's disposal makes the system very versatile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The flexible choice of eligible collateral   also helps reduce the potential negative consequences of the relative heterogeneity of financial markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.92,0)">Indeed, the spread between the day-to-day interbank rate   among participating countries has remained below 10 percentage points on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.52,0)">The actual implementation of monetary policy by the ECB during these first months has proven to be very market oriented, with a major use of open market operations   and a very limited-and decreasing-use of the marginal facilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">As regards the infrastructure for monetary policy implementation, progress has been made in harmonising securities clearing and settlement systems and in introducing a new payments system for the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">As regards settlements, the ECB has created the Correspondent Central Banking Model   in order to ensure that all collateral eligible for monetary policy operations is available to all market participants through cross-border transfers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">As regards payments, the ECB has set up a real time single payments system for the 15 countries of the European Union, which facilitates cross-border payments at all levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">FINANCIAL MARKETS The European money markets , which are most closely linked to the single monetary policy, have undergone a huge structural change because of the introduction of a common refinancing system in the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This has led to a rapid increase in cross-border transactions, not only in volume but also in the number of market participants  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The former relatively segmented national bond markets are rapidly merging into a common Euroland bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Almost 2/3 of the international bond market in EMU currencies now belongs to the euro-area domestic market while the remaining 1/3 of the issuance is composed of issuers from industrial countries outside EMU and supranational institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">New bond issuance in the international markets denominated in euro have increased substantially since January, practically reaching the level of dollar denominated issuance  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">The euro offers an interesting opportunity to diversify portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The currently low interest rates in the euro area offer a very good opportunity to obtain funds through the issuance of euro-denominated bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.66,0)">Fiscal consolidation is reducing the role of the European governments in bond issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Private companies, as well as local governments, are becoming more active in that market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">STATISTICS You will probably agree with me that nothing is more important for monetary policy than good statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The launch of EMU has increased interest in euro-area data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.81,0)">This has required substantial changes to statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.89,0)">At the same time, the adoption of the single currency implies such a massive structural change that it can only affect economic and financial relationships, and therefore statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">What is clear, however, is that the ECB must take policy decisions and explain them publicly in terms of the data available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Co-ordination among statistical authorities in Europe is important, and is stressed in all the relevant legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The ECB and Eurostat work at it constantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.64,0)">THE EXCHANGE RATE Since its launch last 31 December, the euro has depreciated against the US dollar by about 10% in nominal terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">However, its level in nominal effective terms in similar to that reached in mid-1997 and the early part of 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.07,0)">The factors behind this depreciation trend are the cyclical divergence between the economies of the United States and the euro area, the different growth prospects, and the interest rate differentials between the two areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Nevertheless, the fundamentals of the euro area are sound: the area enjoys low inflation, lower than the United States , and there are no risks for price stability in the foreseeable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Furthermore, the euro area has an external current account surplus, compared to the large deficit of the United States .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">All this makes me believe that there is a clear potential for the appreciation of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.67,0)">Allow me conclude by saying that in this speech I have only attempted to describe general developments and draw general conclusions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But, of course, I shall leave it up to you to draw your own conclusions.</span>
