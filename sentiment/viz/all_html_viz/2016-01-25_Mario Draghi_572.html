    <h1> How domestic economic strength can prevail over global weakness </h1>
    <h2> Keynote speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Deutsche Börse Group New Year's reception 2016, Eschborn, 25 January 2016 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)"> How domestic economic strength can prevail over global weakness Keynote speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Deutsche Börse Group New Year’s reception 2016, Eschborn, 25 January 2016 Thank you, Mr Faber, for your very kind introduction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And let me start by echoing what you said about the critical importance of financial market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">As we move towards a Capital Markets Union in Europe, strong market infrastructures are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In that context, I welcome the fact that Deutsche Börse will be participating in our new TARGET2-Securities system, which will help reduce financial fragmentation and make Europe a better place to invest in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.56,0)">The euro area has started the New Year facing two opposing forces: a strengthening domestic economy and a weakening global one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">At home, the recovery is proceeding, with consumption as the main driver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">That is being supported by our accommodative monetary policy, falling energy prices and a neutral fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Employment is rising, up by over 2 million people compared with the trough in 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.36,0)">But in the world economy there is more uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.56,0)">Developments in China and other emerging markets have led to a slowdown in global demand and financial market uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.01,0)">Forecasts for global growth are being cut.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The key question for policymakers in the euro area in 2016 will be which of these forces gains the upper hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Our number one challenge, as a union, is to make sure that domestic strength prevails over global weakness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.38,0)">Our ability to influence the world economy is limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.65,0)">But we can affect what happens in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">We can take the measures necessary to strengthen our economies and make them more resilient to global shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For that, all policymakers need to play their part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The key element is confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Confidence in growth, confidence in stability, and confidence in the future of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Only by building confidence can we turn the ongoing cyclical recovery into a robust, structural recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The role of the ECB The ECB has a central role to play in supporting confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">We do that by fulfilling our price stability mandate: an inflation rate of below, but close, to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">To that end we launched last year our asset purchase programme, or APP, to put inflation on a path back towards 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">And last December we decided to recalibrate the APP to secure that path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.24,0)">That decision was taken because of new downside risks which threatened the outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.37,0)">Those risks were largely linked to external factors, and ones which might not be temporary .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.42,0)">With inflation already low for some time, we saw a danger that a continued period of low inflation – even if oil-driven – might destabilise inflation expectations and become persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.49,0)">That risk was heightened by the fact that “core” inflation, which strips out energy and food, was also low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.25,0)">Core inflation is not our objective, but it tends to lead headline inflation over the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">All this called for a monetary policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">And we chose to respond by recalibrating the APP because we have ample evidence that it works.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I’ve described that evidence in detail elsewhere  , but let me give you just one example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.36,0)">Since the middle of 2014, when we launched our credit easing package, bank lending rates have fallen by 80 basis points for the euro area, and by between 100 and 140 basis points in the countries hit hardest by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.94,0)">To put that in perspective, to have a similar impact on lending rates with conventional policy would’ve required a one-off rate cut of 100 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">What this shows is that, even when rates are at zero, we can achieve the effect of a sizeable rate cut through unconventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Overall, it’s clear that the impact of the APP on confidence, credit and the economy has been substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Some may wonder why we go to such lengths to meet our price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Isn’t it good for people if inflation is low and things are cheaper?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Certainly, in the short run, a fall in inflation helps consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.59,0)">But if inflation stays too low for too long it actually harms them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And that’s particularly the case in a post-debt crisis environment like the one we face in the euro area today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.63,0)">Very low inflation complicates the adjustment process within countries, leading to higher unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.61,0)">It delays the rebalancing process across countries, hindering those that lost competitiveness prior to the crisis from regaining it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.85,0)">And if low inflation is unexpected, it raises real debt burdens making it harder for the economy to grow out of debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">For example, if euro area inflation were to undershoot our baseline by just 1 percentage point each year for the next five years, it would increase the private debt ratio by around 6 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.29,0)">That might not sound like a big figure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">But, over five years, it’s equivalent to €700 billion in extra debt for firms and households at a time when we should be aiming to reduce debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">More fundamentally, meeting our objective is about credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.48,0)">If a central bank sets an objective, it can’t just move the goalposts when it misses it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Confidence comes from every party fulfilling its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And that’s what the ECB will do, as the Treaty demands of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Questions about the ECB’s policy So the ECB is playing – and will continue to play – its part in supporting confidence, price stability and a robust recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But I know that our policies are not uncontroversial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.87,0)">The low interest rate environment and our unconventional measures are seen by some as a cause for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I would not be surprised if that is the case for many of you here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me discuss what I see as the three main issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.12,0)">The first is the perception that low interest rates unfairly punish savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.21,0)">Low interest rates of course lead to lower returns on safe assets, such as deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But what matters for savers is what their assets can actually buy – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">real returns – and how their overall portfolios are performing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.03,0)">And it turns out that on this metric, the situation isn’t nearly as bad as it’s often thought to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">As our colleagues at the Bundesbank have shown  , the real return on a typical private portfolio for a German household since 2008 has been around 1.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.95,0)">That is lower than the pre-crisis average, to be sure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But it’s hardly an “expropriation” of savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In fact, it’s better than in several repeated periods since the early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.41,0)">A related concern is that low interest rates cause people to save more to make up the difference and are therefore self-defeating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.45,0)">But that’s also not quite right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The Bundesbank study I just mentioned shows that just 1% of German households are saving more because of low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.22,0)">For the vast majority – 77% – those rates have not caused them to adjust their savings behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">What low interest rates are doing, however, is stimulating the economy and especially the demand for durable goods, like cars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">That supports the recovery, boosts incomes and will ultimately lead us back to normalisation more quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">If, on the other hand, we were to raise rates today, the opposite would happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.79,0)">It would simply push us back into recession and rates would stay lower for longer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.29,0)">The second concern about our policy is that it threatens financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.99,0)">Low interest rates, it’s said, discourage balance sheet repair and create “zombie banks”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.53,0)">It’s also claimed that they encourage excessive risk-taking, leading to bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.61,0)">And the longer they last, the worse the risks get.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.77,0)">These are doubtless important issues – but is it really the task of monetary policy to react to them?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">After all, as far as policymaking is concerned, what matters for the health of banks is not the level of interest rates, but the quality of supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">And thanks to the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism   and the comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets, banks are actually stronger now than they were a few years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Capital ratios for euro area banks have risen from around 8% in 2007 to close to 14% today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.62,0)">In other words, the risks are currently falling, not rising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.08,0)">What’s more, though low interest rates can encourage risk-taking, there are no warning signs of serious financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.37,0)">Financial crises are typically associated with strong credit growth and rising leverage in the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.9,0)">What we see at the moment, however, is a nascent credit recovery and deleveraging among banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In fact, coming out of a deep banking crisis, rapid credit growth would really be a “luxury problem”!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">That’s not to say we don’t see pockets of exuberance, for example in some housing markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">But euro area interest rates are set to achieve macroeconomic objectives, not to prick local bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In fact, we’ve established a whole new macroprudential toolkit since the crisis precisely for that purpose, and if necessary countries should use it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.12,0)">And let me also add that if we did at some point see a generalised overheating in the economy, it’s never a problem for central banks to withdraw excess liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.01,0)">The third concern about our policy is that it takes the pressure off governments to pursue structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.75,0)">But there are several problems with this argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.33,0)">For a start, it doesn’t work institutionally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.36,0)">It’s not the role of the ECB to use its monetary policy to force governments to reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.87,0)">That’s not our mandate in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.87,0)">And frankly, for us to act in that way would be totally illegitimate as unelected central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.5,0)">It doesn’t work empirically either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There’s not necessarily any connection between interest rates and reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.06,0)">For example, Spain started its labour market reforms when interest rates had already gone down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Italy passed a labour market reform last year in tranquil market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">Likewise, France is pursuing the Macron reforms with no market pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.77,0)">And the argument doesn’t work logically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Think about the types of reforms that euro area countries really need – reforms to judicial systems, to education, to public administration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.8,0)">Such reforms are difficult and can take a decade to bear fruit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Enacting them takes personal conviction from politicians and a popular mandate for change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.93,0)">Whether interest rates are temporarily higher is immaterial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.24,0)">In fact, what typically happens when interest rates are high is not long-term reforms, but rather short-term fixes to placate the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.27,0)">And that normally means consolidating budgets by raising taxes, which makes the recession worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.5,0)">That in turn creates an even harder environment for structural reforms as the costs are higher in a depressed economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">So if we look at these concerns together, we can see a common theme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.47,0)">While each contains a grain of truth, there’s another side to the story which isn’t receiving the same attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And this follows a pattern that we’ve seen throughout the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.5,0)">In the course of the last few years some commentators were cautioning that our policies would cause runaway inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.27,0)">They didn’t.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.83,0)">Others warned that we were exposing ourselves to heavy losses from expanding our balance sheet and accepting lower-quality collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.6,0)">In fact we haven’t had a single loss.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.68,0)">Then those same authorities claimed that our policies were illegal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.73,0)">The European Court of Justice disagreed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Now they warn us about the side-effects and risks of what we’re doing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.0,0)">But what I never hear them discuss is the risks of doing nothing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">What would that mean for our price stability mandate, and therefore for growth and jobs, and eventually, for the future of our monetary union?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.57,0)">Those are, to my mind, the real risks we have to be concerned about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And the path our monetary policy is taking is, in that sense, the path of risk reduction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.65,0)">The role of other policymakers Still, we’ve always said that monetary policy alone cannot be the solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">To give confidence a solid foundation, we have to help a cyclical recovery turn into a structural recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">That depends on other policymakers in the euro area playing their part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">There are four key areas where decisive action could build confidence in 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.66,0)">The first is fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">For a strong recovery, we need fiscal policy to work with, and not against, monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.23,0)">And after much hard work, we now have a broadly neutral fiscal stance in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">But many countries still need further structural adjustment to boost confidence in their public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">So the challenge is how to do that with as little damage to growth as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The key to growth-friendly consolidation is the composition of adjustment: on the expenditure side, cutting government consumption rather than investment; and on the revenue side, shifting and possibly reducing the tax burden rather than raising it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">But what also matters, of course, is that we lift the growth potential of our economies to help grow out of debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">That brings me to the second area where we need action: structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Structural reforms are essential to boost employment, especially in countries that are absorbing large numbers of refugees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">They’re essential to kick-start a recovery in private investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">And they’re essential to lift productivity, so that our shrinking workforces can support our ageing societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.44,0)">Every country of course has its own challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">But if I had to pick out one cross-cutting reform agenda item for 2016, it would be this: making it easier to do business in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">That’s not necessarily about deregulation, but rather taking practical steps to improve the business environment, such as speeding up judicial procedures, or reducing the time and costs for setting up a business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Such reforms would have a direct positive effect on investment, but unlike some other measures, they would have little negative impact on inflation or employment in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.79,0)">A third area is dealing with the high levels of public and private debt which are casting a shadow over the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Part of the solution is to have well-designed corporate insolvency regimes that can separate viable from non-viable borrowers and facilitate the valuation of assets to be sold off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">But it’s also key for confidence that the bank resolution process is absolutely clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In particular, we need to make sure that the new bail-in rules are applied evenly across countries and with the minimum scope for national discretions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.29,0)">We also still don’t have agreement on a backstop for the Single Resolution Fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">And a European deposit insurance scheme would signal progress in completing banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">That brings me to the final area for action: completing our monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The Five Presidents’ Report has laid out a long-term vision for Economic and Monetary Union   and a sequence of steps towards it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Now we need to realise the short-term steps that will lend credibility to that long-term vision – first and foremost, by finishing all three pillars of banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Removing the fragility of EMU, by making progress with both the short-term steps and the long-term vision, would bring about a vital boost to confidence in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.8,0)">The outlook for the global economy in 2016 is uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">But our challenge, in the euro area, is to ensure that global headwinds do not blow our domestic recovery off course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">For that, all policymakers need to work to build confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The ECB is contributing to securing the cyclical recovery by fulfilling our price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.16,0)">And the concerns surrounding our monetary policy do not stand up scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.54,0)">Time and again, the critics of our decisions have been proved wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The ECB has acted independently from the political system and for the sake of the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">To turn the cyclical recovery into a structural recovery, however, others have to play their part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">That entails concerted action on fiscal policies, structural reforms and reducing the debt overhang.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Most of all, we need to continue the process to complete our monetary union on all the necessary fronts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">ecb.europa.eu/press/key/date/2015/html/sp151120.en.html  Bundesbank Monthly Report article: German households’ saving and investment
