    <h3> Speaker: Philip R. Lane </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)"> Frankfurt am Main, 14 November 2019   The international transmission of monetary policy Keynote speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, CEPR International Macroeconomics and Finance Programme Meeting It is a pleasure to speak at the annual meeting of the CEPR’s International Macroeconomics and Finance   Programme, hosted this year here at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">,   I briefly led this programme before my switch to central banking in 2015 and my aim in this speech is to explore some inter-connections between the research agenda of this programme’s research agenda and the analytics of the monetary policy issues that occupy me in my current role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In particular, I wish to focus on the international transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy, which is central to evaluating how our monetary policy affects both the euro area economy and, through various spillover mechanisms, the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The euro area is deeply integrated into the global economy, which means that our analysis universally needs to take into account open-economy dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The euro area contributes about 15 percent to global GDP and accounts for a similar share of global exports and imports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Furthermore, the participation of European firms in global value chains is substantial: even excluding intra-euro area trade, foreign value added as a percentage of gross exports amounts to as much as a fifth of gross exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">On the financial side, euro-denominated asset prices are heavily influenced by global factors, while the high volumes of external assets and liabilities held by euro area residents mean that the international balance sheet is quantitatively important in determining the impact of domestic and foreign shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In examining the international transmission of our monetary policy, I will focus on four dimensions: first, the external balance; second, the exchange rate; third, global liquidity conditions; and fourth, international financial flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Monetary policy and the external balance   We know that low-frequency factors such as demographics contribute to this pattern   but it is useful to explore whether our monetary policy has also played a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In this regard, it is important to keep in mind that a monetary easing that is common to major regions across the world should leave the external balance largely unaffected, whereas an asymmetric monetary easing may affect the external balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A priori, the overall effect of a monetary policy easing on the external balance is non-trivial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.33,0)">Along one dimension, if easier monetary policy raises domestic income, increased spending on imports will weaken the external balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Along another dimension, if accommodative monetary policy generates a weaker exchange rate, this is expected to improve the trade balance  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.68,0)">,   Of course, the timing and quantitative effects of exchange rate movements on macroeconomic outcomes depend on the microstructure of international trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">For instance, the currency of invoicing matters: under producer currency or dominant currency pricing, the trade balance improves due to expenditure switching effects; under local currency pricing, this occurs primarily through terms of trade effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.21,0)">At the same time, the importance of the invoicing currency becomes less relevant at medium to long-term horizons, once firms adjust their markups and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.42,0)">Finally, exchange rate movements can also affect the current account balance through the revaluation of international income receipts and payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Turning to the empirical evidence, recent ECB staff analysis suggests that the net impact of a monetary policy expansion on the trade balance is positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In net terms, the positive effects dominate: the response of exports is stronger than the increase in imports and the decline in the terms of trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">and Karadi, P.  , “Deconstructing Monetary Policy Surprises - The Role of Information Shocks”, AEJ Macroeconomics, forthcoming.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.35,0)">The shock is re-scaled to correspond to a 25 basis point decline in the one-year Bund on impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Monetary policy and the exchange rate Let me now turn to a wider discussion about the interplay between our monetary policy and the dynamics of the euro exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.99,0)">Of course, the exchange rate is not a policy target for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Our monetary policy measures are solely geared towards ensuring convergence to our inflation aim over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.43,0)">Our internal model-based calculations suggest that only around a quarter of the fluctuations in the euro-dollar exchange rate since the summer of 2014 can be attributed to euro area monetary policy, while more than half of the variation reflects the evolution of US macro conditions as well as global risk factors  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To the extent that the current and expected future path of short-term interest rate differentials quantitatively dominates currency risk premia, it follows that the exchange rate may react more strongly to news about the path of the short-term policy rate than to news about asset purchases that operate through the compression of term premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In line with the predictions of uncovered interest rate parity, model-based analysis indeed confirms that the euro-US dollar exchange rate is much more reactive to “rate expectations” policy shocks such as rate cuts than to “term premia” policy shocks, such as those due to the APP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Model-based results indicate that the bilateral euro-US dollar exchange rate on average reacts more than twice as strongly to a monetary policy shock affecting rate expectations compared to a policy shock of similar size to the term premium  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Similar results hold when using the effective exchange rate of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.98,0)">Re-estimations of the model I just described over one-year time intervals indicate that the euro exchange rate has become increasingly sensitive to rate expectation shocks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">After the introduction of the negative interest rate policy, the impact depreciation following a 10 basis point lowering of rate expectations has more than doubled compared with the rate cuts implemented in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">These findings are in line with a recent study that shows that the reaction of the exchange rate to monetary policy shocks becomes stronger when interest rates are lower  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.78,0)">This reflects the fact that term premia have declined much more than rate expectations since mid-2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">A role for term premia in influencing the euro exchange rate is in line with Dedola et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.58,0)">These authors point to several transmission channels through which the APP has significantly affected the euro/US dollar exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">At a basic level, there has been a clear correlation between changes in the relative balance sheet sizes of the ECB and the Federal Reserve and in the euro/US dollar exchange rate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The authors use announcements of quantitative easing   type measures to predict future changes in the relative sizes of central bank balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In turn, they estimate the effects of these exogenous balance sheet changes on exchange rates – and other relevant asset prices – over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.31,0)">The euro immediately depreciates against the dollar, peaking at around 0.35 percent below baseline after nine months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.75,0)">The depreciation is quite persistent and statistically significant up to 18 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.49,0)">The largest contribution, stems from the effects of QE on residual risk premia in foreign exchange markets, as is shown in    QE also exacerbates limits to arbitrage in foreign exchange markets, since it widens covered interest parity deviations reflected in the cross-currency basis, but not to an economically large extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">35 percent which is broadly comparable with the exchange rate effect of an unanticipated two basis point decline in one-year interest rates in the euro area relative to those in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">Implications of monetary policy for global liquidity conditions This brings me to my next point as to whether our monetary policy actions have an impact on global liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">It is well established that US monetary policy is a key driver of the global financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">At a qualitative level, there is similar evidence for the euro area: ECB monetary policy easing reverberates globally by spurring euro-denominated loans outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">For instance,    In response to the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy, euro area banks operating internationally have reallocated funds abroad within their respective banking organisations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In turn, the greater supply of euro-denominated funds outside the euro area has supported euro-denominated lending by banks outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.86,0)">On the other side, such a shock amplifies deviations from covered interest parity – the premium demanded by market participants for taking on a foreign currency exposure over and beyond interest rate differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This deviation – also known as the cross-currency swap basis – determines the euro’s attractiveness as an international funding currency for the synthetic issuance of US dollar bonds  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.41,0)">A more negative basis increases the costs of synthetic US dollar funding through euro debt markets, which tends to discourage international bond issuance in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">By and large, these two effects tend to offset each other, as suggested by the statistically insignificant response of international bond issuance in euro to a shock caused by the ECB’s accommodative asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.59,0)">International financial flows and monetary policy International portfolio flows Let me now turn to the impact of our monetary policy on international financial flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">As documented in previous contributions by my colleague Benoit Coeuré, the APP’s introduction was followed by a striking swing from a sustained period of net portfolio flows into the euro area to sizeable net portfolio flows out of the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.3,0)">Net portfolio outflows reached their peak in 2016, when the monthly pace of APP purchases was at its fastest, and then gradually receded, broadly in tandem with the successive reductions in the pace of monthly purchases until it reached zero at the end of 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.9,0)">The substantial net outflows observed during the previous APP net purchase phase were almost entirely accounted for by portfolio flows into long-dated foreign securities, which outstripped by a wide margin the continued net inflows into euro area equities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.95,0)">The ending of this phase of net purchases in December 2018 marks an important pivot in the data, with the convergence of net portfolio outflows to zero by the middle of 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">APP stands for asset purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.99,0)">Latest observation: August 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Euro area investors contributed sizeably to the net portfolio outflows by investing heavily in long-term foreign fixed income securities during the APP period  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.32,0)">Euro area investors rebalanced their portfolios particularly towards sovereign bonds issued by other advanced economies, most notably US Treasuries, but also sovereign bonds of other jurisdictions such as the United Kingdom and Japan  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This type of investment strategy was notably carried out by euro area investment funds through which households channelled their rebalancing from domestic into overseas debt securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.53,0)">Since the end of net asset purchases at the end of December 2018, flows into non-euro area bonds have become mainly restricted to those issued in the United States, while flows into the United Kingdom, Japan and other jurisdictions have largely evaporated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">APP stands for asset purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.99,0)">Latest observation: August 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.5,0)">Latest observation: Q2 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Non-euro area investors have also been a driving force behind the overall net outflows in portfolio investment though net sales of euro area government debt securities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">These net sales have been another key feature of euro area financial flows since the APP’s launch, mainly reflecting the important role of non-residents as counterparties to the Eurosystem in the APP’s implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.03,0)">In contrast, 2019 has seen a different profile, with the end of net purchases under the APP correlated with the resumption of net buying of long-term debt securities by foreign investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">APP stands for asset purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.99,0)">Latest observation: August 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">More generally, it is remarkable how closely cross-border portfolio flows have tracked the amount of bonds that were eligible for purchase under the public sector purchase programme   but that were not absorbed by it  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This suggests that the degree to which investors – both from the euro area and abroad – were rebalancing their portfolios from euro area to foreign sovereign paper was significantly driven by the availability of euro area bonds  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.99,0)">Latest observation: August 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Additional insight into the dynamics of international financial flows can be gained from viewing international portfolio flows through the lens of monetary arithmetic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.08,0)">While, at that point, the swing towards net monetary outflows to the rest of the world   tempered the growth rate of broad money, these dynamics went into reverse when the exogenous impulse to money creation from APP net purchases began to fade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In particular, the increase in the net external asset position of the banking sector has supported domestic broad money growth in recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Nonetheless, the net external asset position of the banking sector reflects their roles as intermediaries in cross-border payments and as issuers of the bank deposits that form the main instruments for international payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">,   In this way, the monetary presentation of the balance of payments illustrates that external monetary inflows and outflows over the last decade have stemmed mainly from two types of cross-border activity: first, transactions of a financial origin   and, second, the proceeds from the significant current account surplus  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In fact, this sizeable surplus represents a persistent source of monetary inflows that has tempered the impact of APP-induced portfolio outflows on euro area monetary dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.61,0)">In the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium   models considered here, asset purchases in the domestic economy drive down yields of domestic long-term government bonds and incentivise portfolio rebalancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In particular, the strength of the exchange rate effect in the models depends on portfolio rebalancing frictions that operate both through a credit channel   as well as an exchange rate channel  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">The model simulations indicate that global portfolio rebalancing is an important channel through which an asset purchase programme stimulates the domestic economy and that its presence can influence the evolution of the trade balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">In particular, the impact of portfolio rebalancing on the exchange rate is quite powerful in reinforcing the strength of monetary policy stimulus imparted by asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This results in a larger impact on GDP   and a more positive response of the trade balance  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Finally, according to the models, global portfolio rebalancing is more important for the transmission of an asset purchase programme than for the transmission of an interest rate shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.21,0)">For example, results from the NAWM II show that the transmission of a domestic interest rate shock is largely invariant to global portfolio rebalancing frictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">One lesson from recent years is that since our various policy measures   work through quite different cross-border channels, it is important to consider the specific design of our monetary policy packages when tracing out the international transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">A second lesson is that the responses of exchange rates and international financial flows to monetary policy innovations have shifted over time, especially in the light of the differences between “traditional” macro-financial environments and the current environment in which short-term policy rates are either low or negative and central bank balance sheets have expanded so much.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Accordingly, there is a rich and challenging research agenda in international monetary economics and I look forward to the advances that will be made by the researchers in the CEPR’s IMF programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">I am grateful for the contribution of Ramon Adalid, Michele Ca’ Zorzi, Johannes Gräb, Jonas Jensen, Michael Kühl, Arnaud Mehl, Georg Müller, Arthur Saint-Guilhem, Martin Schmitz and Ine Van Robays in the preparation of this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I wear two hats at this event - in addition to my role at the ECB, I am also a research fellow in this programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Although the global impact of ECB is not the main focus of today’s speech, the monetary expansion by a major central bank is typically simulative for the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Recent academic research has also explored the interconnections between international portfolio allocations and optimal monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.58,0)">It is beyond the scope of this speech to review this literature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I previously studied the impact of monetary policy shocks on the current account in Lane, P. R.  , "Money Shocks and the Current Account," in G. Calvo, R. Dornbusch and M. Obstfeld   Money, Factor Mobility and Trade: Essays in Honor of Robert Mundell, MIT Press, pp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.04,0)">385-411.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">At least after some time in line with the standard J-curve effect which holds under the so-called Marshall–Lerner conditions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.94,0)">If the domestic currency depreciates, imports become more expensive and exports cheaper due to changes in relative prices; the depreciation will lead to an improvement in the trade balance if the absolute sum of the long-term export and import demand elasticities is greater than unity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">On the role of invoicing currency patterns see also Lane, P. R. ”Globalisation and monetary policy”, speech at UCLA, 30 September 2019, and Boz, E., Gopinath, G., Casas, C., Diez, F., Gourinchas, P.-O.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">and Plagborg-Moller, M.  , “Dominant Currency Paradigm”, American Economic Review, forthcoming.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.19,0)">For example, a tightening in US monetary policy that is followed by a multilateral appreciation of the US dollar elicits a much stronger slowdown in global trade under dominant currency pricing   than under producer currency pricing  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The reason is that a larger share of global trade prices is sticky in US dollars under DCP, even if the related trade does not involve the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.78,0)">As a result, a larger share of global imports becomes more expensive in local currency terms in response to the appreciation of the US dollar, which elicits expenditure switching from imports to domestically produced goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">, “Monetary policy shocks and foreign investment income:

international flows and the exchange rate is explored in the speech by Benoit Cœuré “Monetary policy, exchange rates and capital flows”, 3 November 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Among others, this is recalled in Engel and West  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.76,0)">One mechanism behind this could be that the exchange rate is determined more by market participants active at the short end of the yield curve, such as traders involved in carry trade strategies, than by market participants active at the long end of the yield curve, such as global bond asset managers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.99,0)">When replacing the bilateral euro-US dollar exchange rate with the nominal effective exchange rate of the euro, a 10 basis point decline in the rate expectations and term premium policy shock depreciate the euro effective exchange rate by about 1% and 0.3%, respectively, on average over the sample.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The exchange rate sensitivity to policy-induced shocks to the term premium seems to have been much more stable over time according to this model.</span><span
