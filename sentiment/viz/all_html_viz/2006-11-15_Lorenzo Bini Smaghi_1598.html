    <span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)"> Ageing, pension funds and household wealth allocation in the euro area Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBKeynote speech at the European Pension Funds Congress Euro Finance WeekFrankfurt, 15 November 2006 Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen: I am delighted to be here today to address the European Pension Funds Congress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In our ageing society, few things are more compelling than devising a functioning system of privately-funded retirement provision with the appropriate return-risk profile and designed with the right incentives for all parties involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Over recent years, pension funds have steadily recovered from the equity market downturn of the start of this century and shown robust asset growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">According to the latest available data, pension fund assets represented 88 per cent of GDP in OECD countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">However, the size of pension fund assets differs considerably from country to country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.9,0)">It is particularly high in the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States  , and very low in countries such as Germany, France and Italy  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.87,0)">Investment strategies differ as well: pension funds are heavily invested in equity in the United States and the United Kingdom  , while they are tilted towards fixed income securities in the main Continental European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.98,0)">There are several factors contributing to the cross-country variation in the design and importance of pension funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.75,0)">Socio-economic trends, demographic structure, fiscal positions and power of trade unions matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The institutional structure of pension systems is likely to be the most important factor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In my intervention today, I will touch upon four issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">First, I will briefly describe the balance sheet of the “typical” household in the euro area and the process of “financial deepening” which is taking place in this sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Second, I will show how different choices for the allocation of household financial wealth can affect household wellbeing, if the time horizon is long enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In other words: investing wisely matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.34,0)">Third, I will provide some speculations about the possible impact of ageing on the optimal   structure of household wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Finally, I will discuss how pension funds can contribute to bringing household asset allocation closer to the theoretical optimum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In relation to this, I will touch upon some aspects of corporate governance of pension funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.85,0)">Financial investment of the household sector in the euro area This chart reports the composition of household financial assets and liabilities in the euro area based on ECB estimates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.13,0)">A note of caution is warranted since we are considering here, for illustrative purposes, the “typical” or “representative” household: in reality, there is considerable heterogeneity across households, but unfortunately we do not have systematic data for all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">One striking phenomenon which has characterised the recent years is the rise   of both financial assets and liabilities of euro area households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This process has been accompanied by a shift, in the assets’ side of the balance sheet, towards a larger weight attributed to savings managed by institutional investors, notably insurance companies and pension funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.89,0)">It is also interesting that the share of bank deposits has tended to shrink in the period up to 2000 but has remained practically unchanged since then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">The share of risky assets such as equity has expanded up to 2000, while it has retrenched somewhat later on, probably in relation to the worldwide collapse of the stock market in 2000 and corporate accounting scandals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Finally, the share of housing wealth has increased, reflecting the strong rise in property prices experienced in most European countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In order to understand household asset allocation, the possibility for households to borrow against future income has to be taken into consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Over recent years, we have observed a strong increase in the level of household debt as a ratio to GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.99,0)">This reflects to a large extent borrowing for house purchase, which is the largest one-time investment decision that households face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The increase in household debt is at least partly related to regulatory and technological advances in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.83,0)">This phenomenon of “financial deepening”, and its characteristics, have two important consequences: first, households are becoming more and more exposed to financial risks and need to be able to manage them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">We can only expect this process to continue with the tendency – expected in most European countries – towards privately funded defined contribution pension schemes and liberalisation and deregulation in banking and financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Second, a larger share of wealth is managed by institutional investors, which implies that households also need to be able to understand and manage an agency relationship that may have important consequences for their long-term economic wellbeing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.43,0)">These are not easy tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.29,0)">Survey evidence, albeit scattered, shows that many households lack a sufficient degree of financial sophistication to be able to understand the risks they are confronted with and make informed choices, especially if we speak of long-term financial risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Of course, this is the main reason why institutional investors are important and are very much in demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Nonetheless, this also raises some other issues to which I will come back later on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Overall, pension and insurance funds represent a significant, but by no means dominant, part of the whole balance sheet of the household sector, especially in the euro area where they make up for about one tenth of total household wealth  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This suggests that, in order to assess if household asset allocation suits the need of an ageing society, one needs to take into account the whole range of financial assets and liabilities, not only those explicitly earmarked as “pension” assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">This global perspective is important if one wants to manage the allocation of pension fund wealth in an optimal manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.39,0)">It is also important to recognize, from a policy-maker point of view, that changes in the size and composition of household financial assets and liabilities make the analysis of monetary and financial developments more complicated  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This is the reason why a broad and deep analysis of households’ portfolio allocation behaviour is essential in order to be able to disentangle the movements in monetary and credit aggregates that are of interest for the assessment of the medium-term risks for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.55,0)">In particular, it is important to filter out the structural shifts in the financial structure from the headline numbers of monetary and financial aggregates, a task which may not be that easy to conduct in real time, but nonetheless essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Asset composition and long-term returns I will now turn to illustrate that investing wisely matters for long-term economic wellbeing, and that the portfolio allocation decision is of paramount importance in order to maintain living standards in the old age.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.45,0)">People often underestimate the power of compounded returns over long periods of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For example, let us assume that a young worker invests 100 US dollars in 1960 in three assets, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.64,0)">cash, Treasury bills and the stock market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let us assume, in line with the literature, that the real return on Treasury bills is on average about 2 per cent, the equity return about 7 per cent, and the real return on cash equal to the inflation rate, with the minus sign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.37,0)">From a long-term perspective the differences in ex post real returns can be very large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.85,0)">In 2000, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.02,0)">forty years later, the initial 100 dollars would have been worth only 17 dollars if invested in cash, 221 dollars if invested in bills, and as much as 1500 dollars if invested in stocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.59,0)">It is not difficult to see that the standard of living after retirement would have been very different depending on which of these amounts the former young worker, now in his sixties, would have had in his hands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.67,0)">It should also be emphasised that the risk-return assessment changes dramatically depending on the time horizon of the worker: indeed, a prospective retiree having all his pension money in a US   stock portfolio in 2000 and retiring in 2003 would have been significantly worse off than a more risk averse investor who chose a portfolio of Treasury bills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This leads me quite naturally to the second fundamental component of investment, namely risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As John Maynard Keynes used to say, there are two basic considerations that people have in mind when investing: first, how to obtain a decent return on their investment; second, how to avoid losses, in particular large losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">So far I have mainly talked about the former concern; let me now address the second.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Indeed, when talking about retirement savings the shortfall risk, in particular when large, is of paramount importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.97,0)">If we look at the historical experience, from a long-term perspective the most important large   downside risk for household wealth is the risk of a hyperinflationary episode which would wipe out the real value of nominal assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">We have observed this phenomenon repeatedly in history: for example in Germany during the Weimar Republic, in China in the 1940s, in Russia in 1992, and so forth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.56,0)">Not surprisingly, these episodes have often coincided with periods of social and political unrest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is not to say that large “real” downside risks have to be neglected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.16,0)">Key examples of real risks, not associated with inflationary episodes, are obviously the Great Depression   and, more recently but less dramatically, the fall in asset prices in Japan as from the early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.18,0)">These risks are important, especially if the time horizon is relatively short, but are typically never as definitive and catastrophic as a hyperinflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.05,0)">Of course, here we are talking about asset categories and diversified portfolios; there is plenty of experience of the assets of individual firms and even sectors being wiped out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.2,0)">The wave of corporate scandals in the early 2000s represents only the latest reminder of this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Therefore, a recommendation that I feel I should give to people   concerned about shortfall risk is to hold well diversified portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That is probably quite well understood for bonds and equity   – though not fully as I will explain in a moment – but is far less widespread for real estate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Overall, a combination of risky and risk-free assets, including equity but also housing and commodities, is probably an optimal strategy for maximising long-term returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Again, I would like to stress that looking at the whole financial portfolio is essential in order to be able to manage risks and opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">From the perspective of a policy-maker, I would conclude that monetary policy has an important role to play, especially if the importance of fixed income securities in household portfolios will tend to increase in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The maintenance of price stability, together with proper diversification and asset selection, is the foundation of a stable growth of pension assets and is essential in order to minimise the risk of catastrophic shortfall risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In this way, monetary policy can make an important contribution towards economic, social and political stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Proper supervision and sound risk management systems in pension funds provide an important complement to price stability in safeguarding retirement savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The possible impact of ageing Let me now turn to the question of evaluating the impact of ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In particular, I would like to address the following question: how is population ageing going to affect the optimal risk-return profile of household financial wealth, in particular with the view of maximising living standards after retirement and minimise the shortfall risk?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.3,0)">As in many fields of economics, the answer is not clear-cut and there are two opposite forces at play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">On the one hand, ageing should make agents more risk averse as they get closer to retirement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Under normal conditions   this factor should make bonds more attractive, and equity, housing and other risky assets less attractive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Indeed, there is evidence that pension funds are investing substantially in fixed income securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.04,0)">On the other hand, a society with a higher old age dependency ratio and fewer young people around is also one in which young workers, who realistically can rely less on publicly funded pension schemes, have to accumulate a larger amount of financial and real wealth in order to maintain living standards after retirement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This implies that young workers should invest more, and not less, in higher-risk, higher return financial assets such as stocks and foreign assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Therefore, in an ageing society we should expect a larger share of risk averse investors  , and a smaller share of less risk averse investors   than it would otherwise be in the absence of such demographic trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.57,0)">It is not clear what effect would prevail in aggregate, nor   what the general equilibrium impact on asset prices and returns would be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Given the potentially dramatic consequences of shortfalls in retirement savings, public authorities   have a keen interest in ensuring that retirement savings are well managed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Maximising returns at a young age and minimising risk at an old age are essential to keep the shortfall risk under control and to preserve living standards under retirement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">It is therefore important that appropriate incentives and skills are applied to the task of managing retirement savings, an issue to which I now turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The role of pension funds The reasons why institutional investors are   important are clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.53,0)">It takes work to invest in complex and risky financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.35,0)">As I mentioned earlier, most households do not have the time, the skills and the endurance to manage their retirement savings properly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">This does not necessarily mean that professionals will do a better job: they will only do that if provided with the right incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">One would think that professional management should be smooth and satisfactory for the beneficiaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.78,0)">That is, alas, not always true: an agency relationship is also something difficult to manage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">We all remember the cases of Enron, WorldCom and the like: employees had given their retirement savings to a company-managed pension fund which was heavily invested in firm shares; a quite spectacular case of non-diversification  , partly driven by tax incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.25,0)">When Enron went bust, the employees lost not only their jobs, but also their retirement funds; employees with 20 years of seniority remained with retirement assets of 100 dollars!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.02,0)">It is interesting that public pension funds   also lost hundreds of millions of dollars due to an insufficiently diversified portfolio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This   example shows that designing the appropriate incentives and safeguards in the pension fund industry is far from being a simple matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.28,0)">Basic agency theory suggests that the relationship between a sophisticated provider of investment services and an unsophisticated consumer is fraught with risk especially   for the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.72,0)">This information imbalance may create a market failure and therefore the need for regulating at least some aspects of the industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In fact, pension funds are subject to significant regulation; such regulation, however, is still significantly different from country to country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.29,0)">For example, Anglo-Saxon countries adopt the “prudent person rule”, with few investment restrictions on any specific assets, while other countries apply more significant quantitative asset restrictions, especially on risky assets such as equity and foreign assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.28,0)">The corporate governance of pension funds is a very complex matter which involves several players   and therefore more than one layer of agency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.4,0)">The role of the beneficiaries is particularly complex since they have characteristics in common both with shareholders and stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">It is not the place to go into the details of corporate governance issues, and I will just note that "best practices" are being developed and should hopefully become widespread in a not too distant future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">In my opinion, pension funds should be better complemented by professional financial advisers to individual households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.28,0)">As I argued earlier, it is impossible to evaluate the optimal risk-return profile for a prospective retiree if one does not take into account his or her complete portfolio of assets   and liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Pension funds are still very much “one size fits all” institutions in most countries, offering a few pre-specified options without arguably enough “customization” to the client’s specific needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">How to develop a contractual and governance framework which would enhance this role is an open, but important, question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In this respect, one can speculate that the predominantly non-profit structure of pension funds is likely to be a mixed blessing in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">On the one hand, the non-profit structure minimises some risks related to agency, in particular the possibility that investment managers pursue objectives very different from those of the investors, for example entailing a too high level of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.17,0)">On the other hand, the non-profit structure may also prevent the development of more aggressive marketing strategies and customized investment counselling, as well as perhaps stifle competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">From a public policy perspective, it is my belief that households at every age need to be made aware of the basic principles of financial investment and of agency, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">that financial intermediaries   respond to incentives and that contractual arrangements have to be analysed with care.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">More extensive financial education and proper supervision are likely to be more effective in alleviating problems related to agency than explicit regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">It is the responsibility of public authorities to further promote financial education programmes aimed at enhancing the awareness of citizens on the financial risks they face in their decisions, including those related to pension funds participation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Conclusions In conclusion, I would draw a few lessons on household asset allocation, retirement, and the role of pension funds: In order to assess the overall prospects for retirement, it is important to look at the balance sheet of the household sector   in its entirety, maintaining a broad perspective; For example, housing can be a form of retirement savings, and not all retirement wealth has to be   channelled through pension funds; Nonetheless, there may be a need to better develop a financial advisory role, which could be either within or outside pension funds, with the objective of tailoring investment strategies to the specific situation and risks of the households, taking into account their financial and real assets and liabilities; It is important that appropriate incentives and sound corporate governance principles are applied; Monetary policy can give an important contribution to this process by ensuring that price stability is maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.84,0)">Indeed, history shows that the single most important long-term risk for young workers, for their living standard after retirement, is inflation.</span>
