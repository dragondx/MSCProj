    <span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)"> International Charlemagne Prize of Aachen for 2002 Acceptance speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Aachen, 9 May 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Ladies and Gentlemen, For the first time, the Charlemagne Prize Association has decided to honour not an individual or a group of persons, but an object.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">You have chosen to pay tribute to "the euro – our money".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For more than a decade now, monetary union has been a focus of public attention and a major issue of public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The depth of feeling generated by the euro, whether enthusiasm or hostility, has been far greater than what we are used to in this typically unglamorous field of economic management that is monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In fact, a lot of the attention gained by the euro was and is directed not so much at the currency itself, but more at the underlying political vision, of which it has become the symbol.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">By accepting today the Charlemagne Prize on behalf of the euro, I would like to pass on the credit for it to those who forged that vision of Europe and turned it into reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Among them were Helmut Kohl and François Mitterand, who jointly won this prize in 1988.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The vision of a united Europe was born, let us not forget, from a desire for peace and prosperity in a continent which was so often divided by internecine conflict, and which embroiled the rest of the world in two wars within two generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.96,0)">It would be inaccurate to say that the vision of a united Europe was born solely out of the horrors of the First and Second World Wars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.35,0)">It existed long beforehand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">But significantly, it was from these two conflicts that the founding fathers of the current process of European integration found the strength to succeed where earlier visionaries had failed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the 1920s, an Austrian diplomat, Count Coudenhove-Kalergi, emerged as the founder of the European movement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">He remarked that "even more than a common history, it is a common destiny that makes the union of the people of Europe a necessity".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Incidentally, and unsurprisingly, he went on to become the first person to receive the Charlemagne Prize.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And as Aristide Briand, the French statesman, later pointed out, it is the mutual vulnerability of the people of Europe – if only because of the geography of our continent – which creates the conditions for solidarity, and the pressing need for mutual confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This, in essence, was the message conveyed by Robert Schuman exactly 52 years ago today, in his famous declaration that led to the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community and that historians generally recognise as the starting point of the process of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">L'Europe – these are the words of Schuman – ne se fera pas d'un coup, ni dans une construction d'ensemble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Elle se fera par des réalisations concrètes, créant d'abord une solidarité de fait.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">It will be built through concrete achievements, which create a de facto solidarity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">How the euro contributes to this solidarity – perhaps more than any other achievement so far – is what I'd like to reflect on first of all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.53,0)">A social contract What is money?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.5,0)">Economists know that money is defined by the functions it performs, as a means of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.32,0)">But, just as importantly, money is also defined by the community for whom it performs these functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Because it is an economic instrument for each of its users, it is also a political and cultural bond between them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Consider this simple fact: we engage in an exchange of goods and services everyday by using money as the means of exchange; and we offer our labour in exchange for money, which, in itself, has no value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">We only do this because we believe that we will, in turn, be able to exchange that money for more goods or services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This fact tells us much about the confidence that we place in money itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">And it tells us much more about the confidence that we place in each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.63,0)">Hence, money is, in essence, a social contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The euro, probably more than any other currency, represents the mutual confidence at the heart of our community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is the first currency that has not only severed its link to gold, but also its link to the nation-state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It is not backed by the durability of the metal or by the authority of the state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Indeed, what Sir Thomas More said of gold five hundred years ago – that it was made for men and that it had its value by them – applies very well to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Every currency is a symbol of the community it serves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It is a symbol of the society as a whole, but also represents the political and cultural bonds between the members of that society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Surely this uniting power must have been felt – I am even tempted to say, physically – by those who have travelled from one euro area country to another this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">From single market to single currency It is not enough to say that the euro is the symbol of a large European community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As a matter of fact, the introduction of the euro also goes back to the economic interests that it materialises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In line with the functionalist approach to European integration taken by Schuman and Monnet, the broader European vision was to be achieved by embarking upon economic integration first.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In 1957, when the European Economic Community was established, its objective was to establish the free circulation of goods, services, capital and labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This was achieved, after the ratification of the European Single Act in 1986, with the creation of the Single Market in 1993.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.28,0)">The four markets for goods and services, capital and labour are exactly those that money serves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is their boundaries that define the area within which money serves the public as a means of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In the context of the Single Market, the establishment of a single currency was the way to ensure that citizens would benefit in full from all the functions of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Far from removing money from people, monetary union has given it back to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">A second contract That the euro has economic origins does not reduce its significance as a social contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">However, its success as a social contract is only possible because it is rooted in a second accord, a constitutional contract, between the citizens who own it and the institution to which they have assigned the task of protecting it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The recognition that the management of the currency, being a policy function, requires a constitutional backing is not exactly new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In 1360, the French bishop and philosopher Nicolas Oresme was among the first to successfully argue that money did not belong to the state, but to "the community and   each of its members".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">One can only give credit to the architects of the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">They recognised the need for the functions of money to be provided at EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The architects of the Treaty also understood that a single currency can only fulfil its monetary functions and its role as an integrating force so long as it retains its value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Therefore, they drew up a solid monetary constitution to protect those functions and its stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The chapter of the Treaty referring to money, in essence, is a contract binding the people of Europe to their monetary authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.38,0)">Like any contract, it contains five elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Firstly, the definition of the interest at stake, which is to provide the economy and society with a medium that performs in a reliable and sustainable fashion the three functions of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In one word, the purpose of the contract is to preserve the integrity of the currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Secondly, the contract establishes the institution entrusted with that mission, which is, of course, the European Central Bank and the central banks of the countries of the euro area, jointly referred to as the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Thirdly, the contract specifies that the primary objective of the central bank is the maintenance of price stability – which is also the benchmark of its success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The central bank is accountable for this objective above all others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The consensus on this fundamental point is derived from academic research and empirical experience over many decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">It is generally accepted that unless the central bank succeeds in maintaining price stability, there is little else it can contribute to economic growth and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">In this respect, the euro has contributed both to the solidarity, and to the stability, of the community it serves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The Maastricht Treaty likewise defines the tools with which the central bank carries out its mission – notably, its independence – as well as the constraints within which it operates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.8,0)">But no contract would be complete without a specification of the responsibilities of its signatories, and procedures for monitoring the fulfilment of the contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The Treaty also meets these concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">My colleagues on the Executive Board of the ECB and myself regularly report to the European Parliament – and through it to the general public – on our policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Via this channel and via the regular reports we issue on our activities, people can judge for themselves if we are fulfilling the contractual obligations and preserving the integrity of their money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The legitimacy and credibility of the constitutional contract that underpins the euro also rely on the contract's durability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">No contract could inspire confidence if its terms were to change constantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Since I mentioned Nicolas Oresme as an early theorist of the constitutional nature of money, I will also quote his words on this matter, to which, 640 years later, I can entirely subscribe: "Moneta debet esse quasi quaedam lex et quaedam ordinatio firma".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Money must be as solid as a law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.66,0)">This applies to the constitutional value of money as well as to its economic value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">It was wise, therefore, that the drafters of the Treaty chose to make the monetary constitution of Europe not only solid, but the most solid in the world, in the sense that it is possibly the most difficult to alter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Towards a third contract We know that such a bold step as the single currency was conceived as part of a wider process of uniting Europe not only economically but also politically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Today, a new path is being explored: the Convention on the Future of Europe has been established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Its task is to make proposals on furthering the construction of a united Europe as well as on streamlining and democratising the structure of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">If it succeeds in this task, the Convention will help to complement the existing economic constitution with effective and transparent political structures and processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In the same way that the economic constitution, because it is based on sound principles, is capable of meeting the challenges of the future, so will Europe as a whole be better equipped to meet its citizens' expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">So will Europe as a whole be better able to meet the challenges it faces, be they from within or from without, and to assume the international responsibilities commensurate with its size and its importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">We may ask what we can expect from the Convention in our main field of interest and responsibility, safeguarding the value of our currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">When quoting Nicolas Oresme, I already implicitly gave my view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">I consider the existing economic constitution, as set down in the present Treaties, to be, on the whole, satisfactory, based on sound principles and capable of meeting the challenges of the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In particular, this applies to the fundamental features of monetary union and the ESCB, the elements of the monetary contract I just referred to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Conclusion Since the monetary chapter of the constitution, at least, has been completed, let me also bring my remarks to a conclusion: For more than ten years, the euro – as a goal – has crystallised hopes and fears, and has attracted praise and criticism, not only in relation to the prospect of a single currency but also in relation to the entire process of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The introduction of the euro was a momentous event for Europe, made possible because of the two contracts I have been talking about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The first, money itself, is the contract that creates ties between the people of the euro area – and also forges links with all other users of the euro, wherever they may be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Even though the euro has formally existed for more than three years, the reality of this contract has only been fully understood with the arrival of euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.34,0)">The banknotes, in their own way, are a physical manifestation of the social contract that is money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Thus, the euro is the symbol of the European Union, understood as a community of people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The second contract is the constitutional contract that binds the central bank – the European Central Bank – to the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The banknotes are a physical manifestation of that contract too, and my signature on them bears witness to that fact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.31,0)">My final words, dear President Ciampi, are addressed to you and are of a more personal nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Some 50 years ago, one of your predecessors as Governor of the Banca d'Italia and as President of the Italian Republic was Luigi Einaudi.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.21,0)">He had already foreseen, back in the 1920s, the threats posed to peace, and even to civilisation, by a divided and mutually hostile group of countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">He advocated a united Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And during the Second World War, while in exile in Switzerland, he wrote with great prescience that a single market and a single currency were the way to rebuild Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">You, President Ciampi, have built on his legacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">In word and deed you have clearly demonstrated your belief in monetary union, your European credentials and your commitment to a united continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Let us hope that Europe continues along this path of unity, and will follow it to the end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">I thank you for your attention – and, of course, on behalf of our single currency, the euro – I thank the Charlemagne Prize Association for this prize.</span>
