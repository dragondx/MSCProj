    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)"> How can the European economy succeed in an increasingly globalised world ?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBPresident of the European Central BankAmsterdam, 15 February 2007 Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure for me to be here today and share with you some thoughts on how the European Economy can succeed in an increasingly globalised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This question is as old as globalisation itself and deeper thoughts on how economies can succeed in the presence of increased trade and integration date at least back to David Ricardo  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">As you know, on the basis of a contract between England and Portugal on trade in wine and cloth, he showed in a model containing just these two goods and the production factor labour, that trade can be beneficial for both countries even if one country has an absolute advantage in producing both goods, that is when it has a relatively lower labour input in producing both goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Although on first sight absolutely simple, Paul Krugman praised Ricardo’s idea as ‘‘  truly, madly, deeply difficult   but also utterly true, immensely sophisticated - and extremely relevant to the modern world’’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Today, more than two centuries later, we still ask how countries should position themselves to gain from trade and integration, but the focus has become a global one, with goods and services, capital and information surrounding the world at a speed none of us would have imagined only a decade ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">For the euro area countries, the change in their economic environment has been particularly marked over the last decade: while being increasingly integrated into the global economy, they are part of the European Union that witnessed a substantial enlargement in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">And they are closely integrated in EMU, where now altogether 13 countries share the same currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Against this background, I would like to split this exposition into two major parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">First, I would like to review some stylised facts on the features of the euro area’s integration into the global economy and how this has changed over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Second, based on how the euro area has coped so far in its increasingly globalised environment, I would then like to draw your attention to structural reforms that I consider decisive for the euro area to remain competitive and to keep pace with its main competitors worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Developments in intra-European integration The economic and financial environment of the euro area has changed substantially during the last decades and is still changing further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">We know that by moving from several currencies to a single currency many costs are reduced or in some cases even disappear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The euro has contributed to reducing trading costs both directly and indirectly by, for instance, removing exchange rate risks and the costs of currency hedging among the legacy currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Information costs have been reduced as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The euro also enhances price transparency and discourages price discrimination: this helps to reduce market segmentation, while also fostering competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Hence, the euro acts as a catalyst for the single market programme and provides a positive impetus to the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Many studies and analyses are now substantiating some of the important effects of the euro adoption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">First and foremost, the euro area economies are becoming more interdependent, as evidenced by the significant increase in intra-euro area trade in goods witnessed since the launch of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Indeed, exports and imports of goods within the euro area increased from about 26% of GDP in 1998, a year before the adoption of common currency, to around 31% in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">This rise in cross-border trade may be associated, to a large extent, with the introduction of the single currency and the increased price and cost transparency that it helped to foster.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">A less-known feature of deepening trade is that intra-euro area trade in services has also grown in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Intra-euro area exports and imports of services increased from about 5% of GDP in 1998 to around 6.5% in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Trade in services should rise faster, accompanying the completion of the single market for services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This is particularly necessary in the financial area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We are perhaps already seeing the first signs of this process; during 2004-2005 the growth of the euro area’s international trade in financial services   surpassed the growth in all other sectors of services, with intra-euro area trade in financial services growing almost as rapidly as extra-euro area services trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The other dynamic sectors on the intra-trade side were computer and information services as well as communication services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The increasing interdependence of the euro area countries is also confirmed by the considerable growth in intra-euro area foreign direct investment   flows, which are now on par with extra-euro area FDIs accounts for about 5 percent of euro area GDP per annum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Such FDI flows accumulate over time and contribute to the reshaping of Europe as we know it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Between 1999 and 2004, intra-euro area FDI stocks grew robustly from almost 14% to around 28% of euro area GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The globalisation process The very profound structural changes in Europe take place simultaneously with the process of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Globalisation is characterizing today’s world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">The internationalisation of economic life is reflected in the sharp enlargement of cross-border activities in the goods and capital markets globally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">As an even greater number of companies and countries have become more involved in foreign trade of goods and services, world trade has been growing faster than global economic output, thereby, leading to a higher degree of trade openness worldwide, which increased from about 45% in 1998 to more than 55% in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The globalisation process is not limited to trade flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Cross-border FDI has also flourished as a result of the rapid internationalisation of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.76,0)">Moreover, not only the amount of investments, but also the structure of world FDI has been affected by globalisation and the worldwide division of labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The motives of production cost savings and new market access resulted in a redistribution of FDI flows and stocks in favour of developing countries, mainly situated in Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">At the same time, one should not forget the role played by the global integration of financial markets, which gave access to international capital for many developing countries, increasing their involvement in the global economy even more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Integration of the euro area into the global economy Taking into account these broad world globalisation trends, one could naturally pose the question “Has the process of intra-European integration advanced in isolation of world trends?”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The answer is a resounding “No”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In fact, exports and imports in goods with trading partners outside the euro area rose from about 24% of GDP in 1998 to almost 30% of GDP in 2005, reflecting an even higher increase than for intra-euro area trade in the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This is mainly due to the more sustained growth in world GDP, an increase in global trade integration and a very sizeable increase of euro area trade with China, emerging Asia, and the new EU Member States that joined the Union in May 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">For example, the share of China and the new EU Member States in extra-euro area trade increased from 11.7% in 1998 to 17.2% in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Also the increase in extra-euro area trade in services was remarkable: from about 7.5% of GDP in 1998 to around 9.5% in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Turning to extra-euro area outward FDI stocks  , their growth in the same period proved equally remarkable rising from 21% to 34% of euro area GDP; albeit the rise was somewhat less rapid than the one observed for intra-euro area FDI.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The financial openness of euro area is also confirmed by ratios of external assets and liabilities to GDP    , which exceed those of US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Taken together, these stylised facts underscore that euro area countries are fully involved in the globalisation process so that we can easily conclude that we are not witnessing the creation of a “fortress Euro area”!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Change in factor intensity of euro area exports Globalisation fundamentally changes world patterns of production and trade, providing a lot of opportunities as well as challenges for the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The crucial question therefore is how the euro area tackles these challenges and opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">In other words, the euro area global competitiveness and trade specialisation in comparison with that of its trading partners is of great importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The results of our latest research on the comparative advantage according to factor intensity show that, between 1993 and 2004, the export specialisation of euro area exporters seems quite broad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">While the euro area does not specialise in raw materials-intensive exports, its comparative advantage lies predominantly in capital-, research-intensive, as well as labour intensive categories of exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The specialisation in the latter category does not seem to be fully in line with the capital-labour ratio of the euro area, which is much higher than in emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Partly, this reflects the export specialisation of some euro area countries in lower-tech sectors such as textiles and paper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">By contrast, the United States and Japan have a strong specialisation in research-intensive exports, in line with their relatively large share of R&D spending in GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">In addition to this, Japan is also specialised in predominantly capital-intensive goods, reflecting its large capital-labour ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Unsurprisingly, China, but also other emerging Asia and the central and eastern European countries   have a concentration in exporting labour-intensive goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The trade integration of the emerging countries should a priori have led to large changes through time in comparative advantages and thus specialisation across countries in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">However, it is rather striking that the euro area’s export specialisation tends to change rather slowly over time in comparison to competitors, and we still see a relatively high specialisation in labour-intensive goods for the euro area despite the increasing trade integration of the CEECs and emerging Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Moreover, euro area specialisation in research-intensive products, which is, as we have seen, not as strong when compared to Japan and the United States, and has not increased much over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.9,0)">At the same time China’s specialisation in labour-intensive goods has actually fallen over time, while its specialisation in research intensive goods has sharply increased and is now larger than that of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.65,0)">Partly this is explained by imitation of technologies, or the assembly of research-intensive products in China, rather than their full development and manufacture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Nevertheless, China is rapidly moving up the technological ladder, possibly suggesting more competitive pressure originating from the developed economies down the road.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">How has the euro area coped so far?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">How has the euro area succeeded in its increasingly globalised economic environment over the last decade?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Looking back I would say that the euro area is able to make globalisation a success for its citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Trade and investment performance have contributed to GDP per capita growth, with GDP per capita growth standing on average at 1.84% between 1998 and 2006, that is the eight year-period since the start of Stage Three of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Furthermore, between 1998 and 2006, the euro area employment rate rose by 5.4 percentage points to 64.4% in 2006  , with females and older workers aged 55-64 even witnessing an increase in their employment rates by 8 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.42,0)">At the same time, the euro area unemployment rate declined by 3 percentage points to 8.3% in 2006   and estimates of the non-accelerating inflationary rate of unemployment   by international institutions point to a downward trend in structural unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.2,0)">Interestingly, given the widespread fears that particularly low skilled persons in the industrialised countries would loose most from globalisation, in the euro area, by skill level, the unemployment rate of low-skilled persons declined strongest over the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.12,0)">While persons with tertiary education witnessed a decline in their unemployment rate by 2 percentage points to 4.7% in 2006 and persons with at least secondary education a decline by 1.4 percentage points to 7.2%, the unemployment rate of persons with just below secondary education declined by 3.4 percentage points to a still high level of 9.9% in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The employment gains for low-skilled workers in connection with the observed growth of the service sector over the last decade may be taken as evidence that the euro area labour force is reasonably successful in adjusting to globalisation by structural change towards services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.08,0)">Despite these successes, the euro area’s capacity to adjust and to grow in the presence of globalisation is far from having achieved its full potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Still more resources must be put at productive use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.84,0)">For example, GDP growth per hour worked in the euro area declined to an average of 1.2% between 1996 and 2005 down from 2.2% between 1990 and 1995, while the US doubled its average growth in GDP per hour worked from 1.2% to 2.4% over the same periods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.86,0)">At the same time, employment is still low and unemployment high in comparison with other main competitors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">For example, the US met the EU’s target of 70% for the employment rate of those aged 15 to 64 by 2010 already in 1995 and the US unemployment rate amounted to just 4.6% in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.37,0)">Furthermore, the share of long-term unemployed in the euro area stood at an enormously high level of 46.8% in 2006, implying that almost every second person in the euro area labour force has been unemployed for more than a year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.33,0)">At the same time, although following a downward trend, the youth unemployment rate in the euro area amounted to 16.2% in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.8,0)">Thus, a large amount of human capital, which is decisive for maintaining the euro area’s competitiveness, is unused and at risk of deteriorating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The need for structural change and reforms For a long time, we have observed that in particular Multinational Enterprises could react flexibly enough to changing market conditions in different areas of the world by sufficiently adjusting their internal division of labour across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Today - and this is one of the main features of globalisation that we observe - each individual has access to the world market via internet and can offer products and compare product prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">It is this feature which, on the one hand, offers enormous opportunities for welfare gains but which, on the other hand, creates great challenges to competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Thus, structural reforms need to be designed such that they offer each individual the chances of gaining from its increasingly global environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In this regard, without aiming to be exhaustive, I would like to highlight four main areas, namely market integration and product market competition, R&D and innovation, an entrepreneurial-friendly environment as well as labour market flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">First, we need further steps in the liberalisation of international trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.51,0)">A danger to world growth is that the current Doha trade round does not succeed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">As you know, negotiations were suspended last July, but I am very pleased that there is a tentative momentum building towards renewing negotiations, which was also seen in Davos and was fully supported by the recent G7 in Essen, whose members gave a clear commitment to the Doha round of free trade talks and accepted their responsibility to ensure a successful outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">I note that this momentum has now led to substantial moves in Geneva, with the WTO Director-General, Pascal Lamy, announcing that he is beginning to reconvene the various negotiation groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">We can only wish him success and ask political leaders, who have said they would like to see a successful conclusion to the round, to follow through their words with deeds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Furthermore, the euro area countries will be the more equipped for the increased globalised economy the more they are able to exploit the benefits of EMU and the EU internal market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">In this regard, existing impediments to the internal market for goods and services need to be removed and financial integration further fostered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Further efforts in the fields of product market deregulation and liberalisation are required to raise product market competition – at the EU and national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">As the example of the European telecommunications market shows, this would enable more efficient production structures associated with a more competitive price setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Second, euro area countries have to raise their innovative activity by investing more in research and development, thereby boosting productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In this regard, an increased level of product market competition would raise incentives to win new market shares by offering new and more innovative products, thus creating a higher demand for R&D.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Against this background, the Lisbon agenda envisages that by 2010 EU countries spend on average 3% of their real GDP on R&D, including both public and private spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">With roughly 3.5% of real GDP being spent on R&D in 2005, Finland is the only country in the euro area that meets this target already.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.06,0)">In contrast, the euro average of real GDP being spent on R&D in 2005 amounted to just 1.9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">To increase investment in R&D it is essential to foster private spending and to not rely on public spending only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Generally, economic policy has to ensure the right framework conditions for private spending on R&D as this would be best channelled towards successful investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">In this respect, necessary structural reforms include market liberalisation and deregulation, but also an adequately trained and educated workforce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">There has been a remarkable catch-up in education of the younger generation compared to older generations in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.4,0)">In 2004, 74% of the euro area population aged 25-34 had attained at least upper secondary education, compared to 59% of those aged 45-54.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">With ageing populations in an increasingly competitive international economic environment, education and training policies have to ensure a high quality education for the young - containing a high degree of basic knowledge but also knowledge demanded by the productive sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">And they have to ensure sufficient incentives for the life-long learning of persons that need to stay for longer in the labour force than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Third, we need to create an entrepreneurial-friendly environment with low administrative and bureaucratic costs for firms and business-starts ups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">This would support the exploitation of new production possibilities, increase entrepreneurial efforts and innovative activity of firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Together, this would raise employment and the potential growth rate of an economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">The immense importance of this issue is increasingly appreciated by the EU and European governments, with the Netherlands being one of the forerunners in the area of ‘better regulation’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">A brief look at numbers shows the potential for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.31,0)">Following studies by the World Bank, in 2006, the average cost of starting a business with up to 50 employees in the euro area amounted to roughly 2226 USD, compared to 285 USD in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In 2006, it took on average 22 days to set up a business in the euro area, compared to 5 days in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.18,0)">As regards administrative costs, studies gauge these costs in the EU25 to amount to 3.5% of real GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Fourth, to fully exploit countries’ changing comparative advantages in producing goods and services it is essential that labour markets can adjust to the variation in their production structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">This requires the right incentives for a sufficient mobility of workers, inter alia, between jobs and regions, but also from unemployment to employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Suitable adjustment mechanisms in the euro area also require sufficient labour mobility across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">The new euro area member Slovenia therefore needs to be granted full access to all euro area countries’ labour markets, which is currently not the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Furthermore, sufficient wage differentiation is needed, especially to improve employment opportunities for less skilled persons and in regions with high unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Generally, wage developments need to adequately reflect developments in productivity by skill level, region and industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.04,0)">Furthermore, adjustments to the level of employment protection are required, in particular where they impede the hiring of younger and older workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In this regard, over the last decade, the euro area countries have made progress particularly in rendering the use of temporary employment contracts more flexible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">As a result, for example, the share of young people working on temporary contracts has risen to 50.3% in 2006, compared to 41% in 1996.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.04,0)">At the same time, the level of employment protection legislation for permanent contracts has only fallen slightly since 1990.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.33,0)">It is therefore important to reform regulation on regular contracts where it has adverse effects on hiring incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Generally, with the ageing of the European populations, employment gains in combination with ambitious and effective structural reforms in the pension and health care sectors are the only way to render social systems sustainable in an increasingly global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Implementing this necessarily non-exhaustive list of structural policy priorities should increase the euro area’s overall flexibility in an increasingly globalised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">For firms in the euro area countries, these reforms should generally lead to a greater choice of suitable investment options and open up possibilities for improved productivity, thus helping them to raise cost competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">As the present strong growth and export performance of the German economy shows, which between 1999 and 2005 only witnessed limited cumulated unit labour cost increases of 2.8% compared to a euro area average of 11%, appropriate unit labour cost developments for producers are crucial for firms’ competitive position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Conclusion I would like to conclude by saying that granting people their share in the gains from increasing integration into the world economy requires most importantly their integration into the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Given the recent gains in euro area employment, one could say that the euro area has increasingly been able to make globalisation a success for its citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">This has been the result of a stepping up of structural reforms in the Euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Progress has been made but a lot remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Globalisation, together with the remarkable advances of science and technology, offers new chances and opportunities for all economies in the world and particularly for the Euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">But we have to be fully aware of the key condition to fully reap the benefits of a phenomenon which accelerates formidably the pace of change at global level: flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">The more all markets of any given economy are flexible, the more this economy adapts rapidly to changes, the more it benefits from globalisation and delivers prosperity and jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">web.mit/krugman/www/ricardo.htm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Stocks of FDIs outside euro area owned by euro area residents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Net international investment position of the euro area was -10.1% of GDP in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">To describe it in quantitative terms we can use an index of revealed comparative advantage, which shows the relative export specialisation to the world in
