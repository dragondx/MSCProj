    <h3> Speaker: Philip R. Lane </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)"> 22 May 2020 International inflation co-movements Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Inflation: Drivers and Dynamics 2020 Online Conference, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland/European Central Bank, 22 May 2020 In my remarks today, I will discuss some analytical issues in understanding the drivers of international inflation co-movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In particular, I will examine the individual contributions of common shocks, structural change and the evolution of monetary policy regimes to the observed high correlation of inflation across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">At the same time, I will caution that correlated inflation paths are not inevitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.33,0)">Some underlying forces may contribute to divergent inflation outcomes in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">International inflation patterns As illustrated in      In fact, as shown in     In the rest of my speech, I will examine the role of a range of factors in these correlated inflation outcomes, including the distribution of underlying shocks, structural changes in the world economy and the role of monetary policy regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.16,0)">Common shocks One possible explanation for the synchronisation of inflation is that shocks have become more synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Since central banks typically seek to stabilise medium-term inflation and do not neutralise fully the impact of shocks on inflation outcomes, it is plausible that a preponderance of common shocks can account for strong co-movements in the deviations of national inflation rates from their medium-term target levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.11,0)">Moreover, in a world of low inflation and low interest rates it is plausible that the impact of negative shocks on observed inflation is likely to be more persistent, since the available policy space to quickly offset negative inflation shocks is more constrained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.64,0)">Under these conditions, there may be prolonged deviations of inflation outcomes away from the inflation aim, with central banks closing inflation gaps over a longer time horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.22,0)">One source of global fluctuations in inflation is the pronounced volatility of commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">That these play a prominent role in global inflation volatility is not only indicated by    Food and energy are the components that are the most correlated across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.34,0)">For instance, the fall in oil prices by about 60 percent since December 2019 accounts for the bulk of the 0.9 percentage point drop in headline inflation between then and April 2020 in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The blue line reflects the zero mean common factor in global inflation as derived by replicating the principal component approach of Ciccarelli, M. and Mojon, B.   for a sample of 33 advanced and emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.33,0)">The yellow line reflects movements of oil and food prices weighted with the coefficients derived by a linear regression of the common factor on oil and food prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.51,0)">The transmission of commodity prices to domestic inflation is, however, neither automatic nor uniform across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.33,0)">At the most basic level, the impact of global shocks on domestic inflation depends on factors such as exchange rate movements and the domestic monetary policy regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.17,0)">For example, it is sometimes neglected that the path for oil prices in US dollars is not the same as the path for oil prices in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.29,0)">While the oil price is globally quoted in US dollars, the pattern of movements in the USD/EUR exchange rate has meant that the oil price in euro has been much less volatile than the oil price in US dollars  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This illustrates a general principle: an independent monetary policy   means that there is no deterministic relationship between international relative price movements and overall inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Two categories of structural change may have contributed to greater co-movement in inflation outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.72,0)">First, structural changes that increase international interdependence mean that a shock in one region may also affect economic performance and inflation outcomes in other regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Second, structural changes that affect national economies in similar ways mean that there may be a common pattern in observed inflation even if shocks are mainly domestic in origin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.45,0)">In contrast, other types of structural change have the potential to contribute to divergent inflation outcomes across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.76,0)">Economic and financial globalisation influences inflation outcomes through several mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">,  First, through enhanced trade linkages and higher cross-border knowledge flows, economic globalisation may contribute to greater similarity in productivity dynamics across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Moreover, closer economic integration through global value chains   and the operation of multinational firms are mechanisms that transmit local shocks to other countries and generate more synchronised business cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.88,0)">For instance, shifts in demand in one economy can affect demand in upstream economies through trade linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This mechanism is confirmed by empirical evidence showing that increased GVC participation is associated with more synchronised inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">The degree of GVC integration also helps to explain the contribution of global economic slack to the domestic inflation environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.24,0)">By one estimate, international input-output linkages account for around half of the global component of producer price inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.48,0)">At the same time, it should be recognised that economic globalisation can also be a source of divergent inflationary pressures, especially during adjustment phases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.94,0)">In particular, re-allocation shocks can see some industries expand in some regions, but contract in others, with a particular impact on wage dynamics if there is a shift in the level and composition of labour demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.5,0)">The contribution of economic globalisation to higher inflation co-movements may also differ between phases in which globalisation acts as an anti-inflationary force and phases in which globalisation acts as pro-inflationary force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.66,0)">As indicated earlier, shocks that push inflation below the target level are more difficult to neutralise than shocks that push inflation above the target level, in view of the asymmetric policy space  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Over the last quarter century, the dominant contribution of globalisation for advanced economies may have been as an anti-inflationary force  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">However, especially with rising wages and income levels in emerging economies, globalisation may in the future act as a pro-inflationary force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This would also be reinforced if de-globalisation forces   served to reverse some of the productivity gains achieved in recent decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Second, to the extent that it is associated with a larger common component in the determination of financial conditions, financial globalisation can also contribute to greater similarity in inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.15,0)">This is most visible during global financial crises, as these are typically associated with significant recessions and disinflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.91,0)">However, in the other direction, financial globalisation can also contribute to asymmetric business cycle dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">For instance, international financial flows may amplify and prolong the domestic credit cycle, with the banking system obtaining additional leverage on international markets during upswings but suffering more rapid and severe funding outflows during downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.89,0)">Moreover, to the extent that financial globalisation facilitates larger and more persistent current account imbalances, this may also contribute to divergent inflation paths between surplus and deficit countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.93,0)">For instance, there is some suggestive evidence that the persistent current account surplus of the euro area has been a low-frequency contributor to the decline in inflation outcomes over the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.77,0)">Third, international migration flows also affect inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.65,0)">At a macroeconomic level, a higher sensitivity of migration flows to the business cycle can dampen the wage response to employment shocks, with net migration acting as another adjustment margin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.41,0)">The wage-setting process may also be influenced by differences in bargaining power between immigrant and local workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.01,0)">Similarly, price-setting behaviour in some sectors may be reshaped by differences in search intensities between different groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In relation to the second category of structural changes, trends such as population ageing and digitalisation are broadly similar across advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.03,0)">In addition to the impact of these trends on aggregate and sectoral economic activity, these forces may also affect price and wage-setting behaviour and alter the monetary policy transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.0,0)">Population ageing operates through multiple channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.97,0)">As well as having an impact on aggregate output growth  , the current phase of population ageing is contributing to the trend decline in the underlying equilibrium real interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.38,0)">In turn, as indicated in the introduction, a low interest rate environment means that negative shocks affect inflation outcomes more persistently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.66,0)">Moreover, demographic patterns influence consumption patterns, altering the composition of the overall price index, and shape the responsiveness of consumption to monetary policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In addition to the general impact of digitalisation on the structure of the domestic and international economies, it is also re-shaping pricing behaviour in many sectors, through the impact of online distribution channels and the automation of pricing decisions based on the information that is contained in real-time datasets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Such digital pricing algorithms may increase increasing the responsiveness of prices to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.86,0)">This effect is likely to extend beyond actual online sales, since online prices also constrain brick-and-mortar prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Digitalisation may also give rise to the emergence of “superstar firms” that assume a dominant market position  , which may also have a substantial impact on pricing behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">These complement changes in market power and market structures that go beyond digitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">While available estimates point to digitalisation having had only a small impact on aggregate price dynamics, the effects may become larger as digitalisation becomes more pervasive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.66,0)">So far, the steady-state impact of digitalisation on market structures and pricing dynamics remains quite uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">For example, while 43 percent of respondents to a survey on price setting in the United Kingdom cited increased competition as a reason for increasing the frequency of price setting over the previous decade, 42 percent cited it as a reason for reducing the frequency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.68,0)">,   Finally, it is important to recognise that some structural trends can contribute to divergent inflation outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Most obviously, the trend increase in the share of services in economic activity in high-income economies means that core inflation will be increasingly determined by domestic factors, given that services are less tradable than manufacturing  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.65,0)">The structure of the international monetary system may also contribute to divergent inflation outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For instance, there is a sharp distinction between the major issuers of international reserve currencies and other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For the former, exports and imports are typically priced in domestic currency, so short-term exchange rate volatility has a much more limited impact on inflation outcomes in those countries than in countries in which exports and imports are typically priced in foreign currencies, with a dominant global role for US dollar pricing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.21,0)">In addition, the latter countries are also more exposed to the global financial cycle owing to the limited capacity of such countries to insulate themselves from international funding shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Monetary policy regimes The convergence in monetary policy regimes across countries has played a central role in the convergence in medium-term inflation outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Almost all major advanced economies now have an inflation aim in the region of two percent, whether formally instituted as a policy target or as a longer-term goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In turn, lower and less-volatile overall inflation is associated with a higher global component in the short-term inflation volatility that remains, especially for countries with more independent central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.34,0)">The impact of a commodity price shock on inflation provides a good illustration of the difference between the initial impact and the longer-term impact of a shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.51,0)">As discussed earlier, commodity price volatility is a common source of headline inflation volatility around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">However, the impact of a commodity price shock on domestic inflation is neutralised over time, with the monetary policy stance adjusted as required to ensure convergence to the medium-term domestic inflation target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">In addition, the anchor provided by the medium-term inflation target means that such shocks are less likely to permeate through second-round effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The challenge for central banks is to ensure that monetary policy strategies successfully protect the medium-term inflation aim by ensuring that the economic and financial assessments that inform policy decisions successfully diagnose the nature of the underlying shocks driving the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This includes recognising the impact of trend forces such as globalisation, demography and digitalisation   on the underlying structure of the economy and the dynamics of wage and price setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In making these assessments on an ongoing basis, it is important to avoid the temptation to extrapolate from recent experience; in particular, some of the forces that have contributed to an increase in international inflation co-movement in recent decades may act as sources of divergence in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.62,0)">These strategic challenges are especially acute under conditions of low inflation and low interest rates, since deviations from the medium-term inflation aim are likely to be more persistent under such conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Accordingly, our monetary policy strategy review – even if it is unavoidably delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic – remains a high priority for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">I am grateful to Chiara Osbat and Miles Parker for their
