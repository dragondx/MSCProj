    <span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)"> Payments for the people Introductory remarks by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Chair of the CPMI, at the ‘High-level meeting on financial inclusion’, Basel, 27 May 2019 Introduction Thank you Agustín for the kind words of welcome and for hosting this fifth high-level meeting on financial inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Thanks also for your continuing support of the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">I am honoured to be co-hosting this meeting with Queen Máxima of the Netherlands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Her Majesty is here today in her capacity as the United Nations Secretary-General’s Special Advocate for Inclusive Finance for Development  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">You will also know Queen Máxima as an honorary patron of the G20’s Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">By lending her voice to raise global awareness of the importance of financial inclusion in the fight against poverty and gender inequality, Her Majesty is an extremely effective advocate of universal access to affordable, effective and safe financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">We are genuinely grateful for your support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Today, we are bringing together the United Nations, the global standard-setting bodies and a range of other international organisations, central banks and non-governmental organisations to discuss financial inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Before we turn to the agenda, allow me to reflect briefly on financial inclusion and payments, drawing on the work of the CPMI.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.23,0)">Payments and financial inclusion Milton Friedman once said that “inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.73,0)">In a similar vein, I would argue that financial inclusion is always and everywhere a payments phenomenon – at least in the early stages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.65,0)">Payments are the lifeblood of any economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Think about the basic needs that we pay for on a daily basis: food, transportation, healthcare and clothing, to name but a few.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Paul   In the meantime, the PAFI framework has been adopted as the analytical underpinning for designing and implementing country-level actions under the World Bank’s Universal Financial Access 2020 agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">By the end of last year, the PAFI framework had been used as a tool to critically analyse the degree of access to payment services and transaction accounts and their usage in about a dozen countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In addition, many countries have used the framework to undertake a self-assessment of the financial infrastructure in their country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">As we mark the PAFI report’s third anniversary, it seems like a good time to review the progress made in expanding access to payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Since 2011, more than one billion adults have gained access to basic transaction accounts – that is, accounts with a financial institution or a mobile money service provider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Much of this gain can be attributed to the greater use of new technologies, including smartphones and the internet, which enable services to be provided using digital channels instead of through bricks-and-mortar operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Such electronic channels support the efficient and low-cost delivery of services, even in remote areas, and open up markets to new providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.6,0)">Yet, as of 2017, around 30% of the adult population worldwide still lacked access to payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.16,0)">While financial exclusion is also an issue in some advanced economies, it affects a majority of adults in Africa and South America.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Only seven African countries have achieved a 60% penetration rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.47,0)">In many African countries, less than half the population has access to basic payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.22,0)">Unfortunately, but not surprisingly, the lack of access to an account disproportionately affects low-income households and women.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.35,0)">Financial exclusion of this type threatens the cohesion of societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.59,0)">It is often part of a much wider social exclusion faced by individuals who lack access to education, insurance or healthcare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.13,0)">And those who do own an account often face large transaction costs, particlarly in cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Take remittances as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">The World Bank estimates that almost USD 530 billion in remittances were sent last year – more than three times the amount of official development assistance sent to the receiving countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.2,0)">Evidence shows that foreign workers from low- and middle-income countries sending funds home face an average cost of about USD 14 for a USD 200 payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.7,0)">In other words, cross-border payments still tend to be notably slower, more expensive and more opaque than domestic payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.16,0)">No wonder, then, that many turn to what I call “shadow payments”, such as informal networks or unregulated cryptocurrency platforms, that lack proper cyber security, basic risk management, legal certainty or consumer protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.42,0)">New SWIFT data that the CPMI is publishing today provides further evidence that access to safe and cost-effective cross-border payments is not improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.92,0)">It shows that the correspondent banking network has shrunk by 20% over the past seven years and has become more concentrated as a result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Taking PAFI forward Broader access to payment systems is therefore crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.62,0)">The PAFI report notes a number of potential barriers to providing transaction accounts, from high fees, low income levels and poor financial literacy, to economic and labour informality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.49,0)">Many of these issues remain today, and are also a problem for emerging fintech solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Many fintech solutions, for example, require a smart phone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.78,0)">Such requirements add to the cost of the solution and automatically exclude certain populations – those with low income levels or limited technical aptitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">These remaining obstacles clearly illustrate that we need to continue our efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">That’s why, in late 2018, the CPMI and the World Bank embarked on the next stage of our journey on the road to ensuring universal access to transaction accounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The PAFI task force will be focusing on the following three topics: First, we are reviewing the lessons learned from applying the PAFI framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">We will look at how PAFI is being implemented, the challenges involved and recent developments in payments that need more detailed guidance, such as emerging fintech solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">And we will build on previous CPMI work on fast payments, correspondent banking, cross-border payments and digital currencies and see how this could broaden access to existing and new payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Second, we will develop a toolkit to facilitate the application of the PAFI guiding principles and key actions for consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This work stream will aim to provide more detailed guidance on how to approach specific issues in practice, and possibly also on the interpretation of some of the guiding principles and the accompanying key actions for consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">We hope that a practical toolkit to promote financial inclusion will inspire public and private sector organisations in interested countries to do more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">And last but not least, we are also developing a framework for measuring the effectiveness of financial inclusion efforts from a payments perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">This will allow us to measure progress more accurately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The framework will provide guidance on a set of indicators, together with the underlying methodology, that can be developed by each country to measure the effectiveness over time of its financial inclusion efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">We believe that helping countries to assess the progress they are making will allow them to better target their financial inclusion policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">As you can see, this is quite an ambitious work programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">We have also set ourselves an ambitious timeline: we aim to finish the PAFI work in the first half of next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">And in addition to the work being done by the PAFI task force, the CPMI is also supporting the Financial Inclusion Global Initiative, which is a three-year programme led by the World Bank Group, the International Telecommunications Union, the CPMI and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Its objective is to provide targeted technical assistance to China, Egypt and Mexico to increase acceptance of electronic payments, extend the use of digital identification for financial services and enhance payment system security, infrastructure and technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Conclusion Financial inclusion starts with payments, and with this I would like to conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">It has therefore been, and remains, a key objective for the CPMI.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Thanks also to the support of Queen Máxima, significant progress has been made in recent years, with a number of innovative solutions helping to increase access to payment services for underserved populations around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.39,0)">However, a significant number of people across the globe still lack the means to make fast, secure and trustworthy payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.19,0)">Lack of access to basic payment services risks feeding wider social exclusion and supporting the rise of potentially unsafe shadow payments that do not offer legal certainty or sound credit and liquidity risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">To protect consumers, and to spread the benefits of financial inclusion more widely, we need to continue our work – in close cooperation with all stakeholders – so that everyone, and not just a portion of the population, enjoys access to basic payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Ultimately, this work will not only benefit those who become financially included; it will also foster social cohesion and support economic prosperity more broadly.</span>
