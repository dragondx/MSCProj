    <span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)"> Domestic payments in Euroland: commercial and central bank money Speech by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the European Commission Round-Table "Establishing a Single Payment Area: State of Play and Next Steps", Brussels, 9 November 2000 Introduction Thank you for giving me the opportunity to present the Eurosystem's view on the current state of affairs in European cross-border retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As you are aware, today's date is an important one in European history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Exactly eleven years ago, East German citizens tore down the Berlin Wall and paved the way for German unification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">If I can draw, from this big historical event, an analogy for our small world of payment arrangements, I would like to express my sincere wish that today's meeting will help tearing down the walls impeding full integration of retail payments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The Eurosystem is strongly committed to achieving this objective very soon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Indeed, 2002 should be the landmark in this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In my remarks today, I will first recall the central bank role in retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Next, I will explain what our common objective for 2002 should be and evaluate what has been done so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Before concluding, I shall also comment on the instruments that the Eurosystem has at its disposal to perform its payment system functions and on its oversight role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.77,0)">Central banks and retail payments Central banks have been created to operate payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.2,0)">At their very origin, they were entrusted with the monopoly for the issuance of banknotes, as paper currency previously issued by commercial banks or non-bank enterprises proved unsatisfactory or even unreliable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.83,0)">Central banks were then called "banks of issue".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Later, they became "central banks" because of their role as "bank of the banks".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.58,0)">Their functions in the fields of banking supervision and monetary policy followed the payment systems one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In recent years, the attention of central banks has focused on systemic risk and on the oversight of large value payment systems, with the adoption of the Lamfalussy report and the development and use of RTGS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.98,0)">As a result, the view sometimes prevails, even among central banks, that their role in payment systems is now played more   in the field of large value systems, rather than in retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.51,0)">I do not share this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">Retail payments are in fact the heart of central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.31,0)">Central banks would betray their origins and their social function if they neglected that field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In Europe, this view is clearly supported by the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Indeed, Articles 3 and 22 of the Statute of the ESCB neither limit the tasks of the Eurosystem to risk considerations nor do they limit its possible intervention to large-value payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The Statute explicitly allows for an operational involvement of the Eurosystem that is based on efficiency grounds, and makes no distinction between different categories of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">One can also refer to the US approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">A key provision of the 1913 Federal Reserve Act   states that all checks should be cleared nation-wide under the same conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">More recently, in 1998, a committee headed by Alice Rivlin the Vice Chair of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, analysed the role of the Federal Reserve System in retail payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The committee liased with market participants and evaluated several options for the Fed's involvement in retail payments, ranging from complete withdrawal to taking a leading role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The report confirmed the operational role of the Federal Reserve in retail payment systems and strongly recommended that it plays a leading role towards enhancing the efficiency, effectiveness and convenience of retail payment services, in co-operation with market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Why have central banks been chosen for such leading role?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">First, because of the experience they have accumulated in the field, which comes from their history of providing payments instruments   to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.8,0)">Second, because central banks are "banks of the banks", one should even say "banks for the banks".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">For those reasons, they are the public authorities that have the operational knowledge and the practical experience required to exercise the public functions involved in the payment system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.36,0)">The objective for 2002 At the beginning of the 20th almost the totality of retail payments were made in central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Over time, this monopoly came to be shared with commercial banks, when deposits and their transfer via checks and giros became widely accepted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Banknotes and commercial bank money became fully interchangeable payment media that customers could use according to their needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.13,0)">While transaction costs in commercial bank money were shrinking, cashless payment instruments became increasingly used, at the expense of banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.38,0)">When looking at the 2002 horizon, however, we have to recognise a dramatic discrepancy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">On their side, central banks are producing an enormous effort to prepare the cash changeover  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">That effort will make sure that, within the first few weeks of 2002, the currency borders for banknotes in the euro area will disappear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The banknotes will be identical and freely circulating in any part of the area without costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.46,0)">For central bank money, the distinction between domestic and cross-border payments will disappear in early 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.13,0)">Indeed, the very notion of "cross-border" payment will then lose any meaning within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">All payments in Euroland will be domestic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Now, and this is the key point I want to make today, it is absolutely crucial that borders will cease to exist also for commercial bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This means that, after 2002, indifference between commercial bank money and central bank money will have to apply to the whole of Euroland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Only by achieving this goal would the banking system continue to fulfil the responsibility it has taken up more than a century ago when it began replacing central bank money with commercial bank money of its own creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is true that, when a retail payment involves entities based in two different countries, the cost of processing it is today higher than when the entities are in the same Country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.93,0)">This is why payments between Lyon and Torino remain less efficient than payments between Torino and Palermo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In early 2002, however, the distinction between domestic and cross border payments will have to disappear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.99,0)">The Eurosystem is very concerned that this might not be the case for commercial bank money in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This concern is based on two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">First, because the Eurosystem has the mandate to promote the smooth functioning of payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.37,0)">Second, because, if there remains a distinction between domestic and cross-border payments in the euro area after 2002, this will disappoint the expectations of European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The Eurosystem cannot be indifferent to such development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.84,0)">Nor should the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">As you know, non-bank institutions have already started to lobby EU institutions in view of obtaining an "EU passport", using the deficiencies of the banks in the retail field as an argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Achievements so far It is true that the matter is not an easy one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.4,0)">Payment systems depend on infrastructures which have been set up at domestic level and which are difficult to interconnect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">Changing them requires high costs and long lead times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.68,0)">Unfortunately, banking systems have done little in this field until the start of 1999, when the Eurosystem decided to tackle this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The Eurosystem approached the problem in a pragmatic way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We first listened to the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.64,0)">They gave us a number of arguments explaining why retail cross border payments are more slow and costly: there is no business case; the infrastructures are inadequate; no common standards are used; double charging cannot be avoided; and reporting requirements for balance of payments are expensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.24,0)">Let me briefly review these various arguments one by one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.71,0)">We were not convinced by the business case argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Is there a business case for a payment between a village in Aquitaine and one in Alsace having the same cost and speed as one between Paris and Lyon?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.92,0)">Are prices high because traffic is low, or is traffic low because prices are high?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Even if there were no "business case", in a narrow sense, there is a very strong one in a broader sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In fact, banks understood this, but in 1999 only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">In the field of the infrastructures, the banking sector has been very active.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">In particular, they have decided to set up a new system called STEP1, which will have an extensive coverage within the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The ECB has welcomed this initiative and has assessed the system positively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">On the standards front, when the Eurosystem started to be heavily involved in 1999, most of the standards needed were already available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The two key standards have been the International Bank Account Number   and the International Payment Instruction  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.88,0)">Only one element was missing for complete straight through processing: a special SWIFT message for the interbank part of the transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The ECB launched the discussion and participated in the inter-bank work which have led to the definition of the missing link  : in the jargon of technicians this is the MT 103+ message.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.98,0)">One well known problem remains: the implementation date for all these standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.74,0)">Banks tend to delay the implementation date of the standards because of the costs involved and because there is no incentive to be among the first to implement standards, since these are only beneficial when they are widely and commonly used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">So we did what all central banks would do in such circumstances: we urged banks to speed up the process and to publicly commit themselves on an early implementation date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.96,0)">Double charging is obviously unacceptable and today even illegal in some cases  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.96,0)">In the postal service, double charging disappeared about two centuries ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.75,0)">One solution to avoid double charging could have been to decide that only the sending bank charges a payment fee, and that the money collected on the sending side would also cover expenses linked to incoming payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This scheme has often been adopted at the domestic level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.11,0)">However, within the euro area there are large imbalances between the North   and the South  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.99,0)">The absence of a mechanism to remunerate the receiving bank would clearly be detrimental for banks which are active in Southern Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Of course, banks could have found a solution by themselves before the 1997 directive was implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.22,0)">But they did not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In 1999, the Eurosystem acted, as other central banks would have done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">We have urged the banks to define a short-term solution and they have proposed to set up a Multilateral Interbank exchange Fee  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">We have evaluated this arrangement against other alternatives and discussed the matter with the Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Our conclusion is that the MIF represents a solution, at least in the short run, provided the fee is low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.39,0)">Reporting requirements for balance of payments purposes have been the argument traditionally used by banks to return the problem of high charges to the public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The dilemma for public authorities, including central banks, is that they want both good statistics and good payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The ECB has promoted bilateral discussions, first, between statisticians and Eurosystem payment systems experts and, later, between statisticians and banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.18,0)">Eventually, the statistical authorities have decided to exempt all payments below EUR 12,500 from any reporting requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Many banks would have preferred a higher threshold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">One should, however, be realistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">This brief review suggests that all the conditions are now set for banks to be able to fulfil the criterion of indifference, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">to ensure equal cost and speed of commercial bank money transfers throughout Euroland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Of course, the positive achievements mentioned before are recent and their impact will take time to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The central bank can understand this argument, but is convinced that 2002 should be set as the key year just as it is the key year for banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The Eurosystem instruments Let us now turn to the instruments available to the Eurosystem to carry out its payment system functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">When central banks promote reforms of payment systems, their preferred strategy is to reach common agreements through co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">In all countries, the central bank and the local banking community have found a way to organise discussions and find a consensus on most payment systems issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">ZKA   in Germany, APACS   in the UK and CFONB   are three examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These bodies are not totally comparable in status and activities, but they are all fora where banks and central banks can co-operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">The Eurosystem has still to firmly establish such a forum, although it is increasingly discussing payment systems issues with the banking community of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Regular meetings are being organised with banks on various issues, like retail payments, TARGET, or securities settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.54,0)">Central banks may also have recourse to two other instruments: operational involvement, and regulation, either directly, when the central bank has regulatory power, or indirectly, by making proposals for legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Operational involvement is an instrument available to most central banks, including the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">TARGET has been created to contain systemic risk through the continuous use of central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">In the retail field, however, there may be no such need, because the banking sector itself should be able to process retail payments sufficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.16,0)">Only if banks fail to deliver efficient and cheap payment services throughout the euro area, would the Eurosystem be compelled to set up a "TARGET for the citizen".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This idea deserves careful examination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">If the issue were a lack of interbank infrastructure, TARGET could easily be used to develop a solution for retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Today, however, efficient solutions for processing payments between banks, like the STEP1 system, exist or are under preparation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.77,0)">The problem we are facing now is rather one of relations between banks and their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.01,0)">In this field, the operational involvement of the Eurosystem would become more complex because central banks do not have a network of ordinary customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.12,0)">That said, it remains that, if banks fail to deliver what the society expects from them in the early days or weeks of 2002, a Eurosystem solution cannot be excluded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Concerning regulation, this instrument has explicitly been granted to the Eurosystem by the Treaty  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">While this tool has not been used so far, it should, by no means, be forgotten.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.79,0)">Regulation could be used as an outcome of co-operation, with a view to formalising an agreement, or as a substitute for co-operation, when the latter failed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In practice, however, central banks are reluctant to substitute regulation to negotiation and moral persuasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.77,0)">Regulation, indeed, is rarely a good instrument to solve efficiency problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.15,0)">This is shown, for example, by the limited effect the 1997 Directive has had on prices for retail cross border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.1,0)">Regulation may also prevent the market from finding appropriate outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.23,0)">One example of this is the law of cheques in France which dates from the 1960s and which has clearly led to an excessive use of cheques that is now difficult to modify.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.57,0)">The risk of over-regulation also exists at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.31,0)">For instance, it has been argued that the 1997 directive on cross-border transfers should be revised because it imposes a six-day delay for processing payments, while most banks can now process payments in three days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The fact that most banks do better than required should be applauded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.73,0)">When technology and market forces work, a new regulation in this field would serve no purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.21,0)">It could even be counterproductive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Another instance of potential over-regulation is suggested by the idea to prepare a directive on a European direct debit scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The creation of a European direct debit is indeed an objective, but one may doubt whether it is appropriate to start with a legal instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The direct debit has been introduced in the past twenty years in most EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The process never started by a regulation, but by a study made by the banking sector, in general with the strong involvement of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These studies generally concluded that some rules had to be changed for the schemes to be effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.63,0)">Legislation then took place, only when necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The Eurosystem oversight Let us now move to the Eurosystem oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.49,0)">Oversight is the expression used to describe the function of central banks aiming at the efficiency and soundness of payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The main objectives pursued are the maintenance of systemic stability, the promotion of efficiency and the safeguarding of the transmission channel for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Payment systems oversight shares with prudential supervision the objective of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.21,0)">However, while prudential supervision looks at institutions, payment systems oversight looks at systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.28,0)">The word "system" could refer either to a particular funds transfer system, or to the general organisation of payment services in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">For my remarks today, this second aspect is more relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.04,0)">Oversight may or may not be based on explicit legal provisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Central banks developed oversight frameworks in the 1980s, mostly on a non-statutory basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Later, however, their oversight role gradually became recognised in law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For the Eurosystem, it is embedded in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In June 2000, the ECB published a document entitled "Role of the Eurosystem in the field of payment systems oversight".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This document explains the set up of the payment systems oversight function in the decentralised environment of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It also deals with retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The decentralisation principle means that, to the extent possible, the tasks of the Eurosystem are carried out through the national central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In the area of payment systems, this means in practice that the Governing Council of the ECB formulates the common oversight policy stance in those cases where the functioning of the systems may affect the implementation of monetary policy, systemic stability, the establishment of a level playing field between market participants, or cross-border payments within the EU or with other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In other areas, NCBs apply specific policies tailored to their national environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.95,0)">Decentralisation is sometimes, but inappropriately, referred to as a case of application of the principle of subsidiarity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The principle of subsidiarity leaves to the national level competencies for which there is no advantage to exercise them at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Decentralisation is a modality to carry on a European, or euro area, competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In the field of payment systems, a competence has clearly been entrusted to the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.48,0)">In that field, subsidiarity does not apply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Decentralisation does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Conclusion It is time to conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The improvement in retail cross-border payment services depends on infrastructures and procedures more than on regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.89,0)">Banks have done too little until 1999 when they "discovered" the political problem they will face in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">At this point they started moving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In early 2002, the moment of truth will come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Banks in the euro area will face a critical decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.63,0)">Indeed, they will have to decide whether they might change their pricing policies in the field of cross-border payments or instead face unpopularity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.78,0)">This is a difficult choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In making it, banks may want to consider the costs of the promotion campaigns they may have to conduct to redress their image.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.28,0)">This is a kind of cost that payment systems experts may not be aware of.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.32,0)">But the banks' CEOs are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">The conclusion is that the royal way may be for banks to price domestic and cross-border payments at a similar level, and make all efforts possible to allow for the costs also to become the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The challenge is to prepare the 2002 changeover in a way which will ensure that central bank money and commercial bank money are offered to customers under the same conditions, so that the principle of indifference between the two is respected.</span>
