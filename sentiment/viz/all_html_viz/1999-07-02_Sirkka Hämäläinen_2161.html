    <h1> The first six months of European Economic and Monetary Union </h1>
    <h2> Speech delivered by Ms Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the ACI's World Forex International Congress and General Assembly Milan, 2 July 1999 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Sirkka Hämäläinen </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)"> The first six months of European Economic and Monetary Union Speech delivered by Ms Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the ACI's World Forex International Congress and General Assembly Milan, 2 July 1999 It is a great honour for me to be invited here today to the ACI's World Forex International Congress and General Assembly to share with you some reflections on the developments that we have seen in financial markets during the first six months of European Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Indeed, this is one of the most appropriate gatherings at which to reflect on the euro and its implications for financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Where else can one find such a distinguished assembly of international market participants that have contributed so much to the creation, introduction and the development of the euro financial market?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">The experience of the first six months of the Monetary Union, while only a very short period, does indeed provide some food for thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.05,0)">What were the expectations concerning the euro before the start of Economic and Monetary Union?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Are these expectations being fulfilled?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.9,0)">If so, to what extent?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Of course, it is only natural to discuss the evolution of the euro exchange rate over the past six months at a gathering of forex experts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.79,0)">If I did not, I should disappoint many of you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Therefore I shall also provide you with some brief reflections on the latest developments in the foreign exchange market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">However, I should like to do so in the wider and longer-term context of the euro project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">I regard it as more important to look at what Economic and Monetary Union has brought about in terms of structural developments in the European financial markets and to put this into the context of longer-term economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.32,0)">What was the expected impact of the euro on financial markets?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.05,0)">Throughout 1998, there was a growing interest in the possible effects of Economic and Monetary Union on financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This was manifested in a large quantity and wide variety of analysis and research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">A particular focus was the importance of the introduction of the single currency for the integration of financial markets and for the possible development of new financial products in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Structural changes and developments were expected across financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">In particular, I should like to mention five areas in which there were widespread expectations of major developments: First, Economic and Monetary Union was expected to foster a closely integrated money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The creation of a single yield curve would be an important element in creating an integrated and liquid money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Second, the euro would contribute to an integrated, deep and liquid bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Indeed, the main reason for a national preference in investment would disappear because the introduction of the single currency would remove one of the most important risk barriers, the exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Third, there were hopes that the large size of the euro area bond market would make it an attractive place for global asset managers to invest in and for international issuers to raise funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Fourth, better functioning and wider capital markets could further underpin the trend towards increased securitisation in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Indeed, it is important to recall that a key difference in the euro area financial structure compared with that of the United States lies in the respective roles played by banks and securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Equity and debt securities markets provide the principal means of financing and saving in the United States, while in the euro area the financial system is mainly based on banking products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is clearly visible when looking at indicators such as bank deposits, or the amount of bank credit and domestic debt securities relative to GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Outstanding debt securities in the United States are, for example, in relation to GDP, twice as large as in the euro area, while stock market capitalisation is far higher as a ratio of GDP in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Finally, the introduction of the single currency would mean that transaction costs and hedging costs would be reduced, as a larger currency with a more developed financial market structure would provide a greater variety of instruments for hedging than were available for national currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">How do actual developments in the first six months compare with expectations?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me now turn to the developments that we have actually seen in the financial market in the first six months of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I should like to begin with the money market, which is the market in which the euro has obviously had the greatest impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The functioning of the euro area money market has undergone a fundamental transformation in the past six months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">It is remarkable how rapidly and smoothly the transition from the former segmented national money markets to an integrated market was made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The high degree of integration is shown by the minimal rate differences between the various countries already achieved in the course of February 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The dispersion of overnight interest rate spreads among countries, as measured by the EONIA   has generally been low, rapidly reaching a level of around 2-3 basis points, with no systematic differences across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A single money market curve for the euro area was established right from the outset, starting with the overnight rate and including deposit rates for maturities of up to one year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Of course, the establishment of the EURIBOR as well as the EONIA, a reference rate for the euro overnight market, by the ACI and the European Banking Federation provided important points of reference and scope for development of the euro money market and its products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Here, I should specifically like to point to the use of these references in the derivatives market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The overnight index swaps against the EONIA are among the most liquid instruments in the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Also, the money market has very quickly adopted the EURIBOR as reference to which the short-term futures market and the long-term swap market are linked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">The rapid and smooth flow of funds throughout the euro area was a precondition for ensuring that cross-border arbitrage would eliminate interest rate differentials across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The elimination of cross-border interest rate differentials was, in turn, a precondition to enable the Eurosystem to achieve a single monetary policy stance throughout the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Such a development was assured by the efficient integration of payment systems, including, in particular, the cross-border services provided by TARGET, the real-time gross settlement system covering the entire euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Linking all the large-value national payment systems in the EU, this system handles even more cross-border payments than our most optimistic assumptions would have suggested.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">It is already on the same level, in terms of overall turnover, as the long established Fedwire system of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Despite these highly positive signs of integration in the money market, the repo market does not yet show the same high degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.77,0)">I should like to mention here that the so-called "General Collateral" repo market is still somewhat segmented into different national markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.29,0)">The slower pace of integration in the repo market appears to some extent to reflect the lack of a fully-fledged infrastructure for an efficient cross-border transfer of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.34,0)">Settlement of securities transactions in different government bonds is primarily performed in domestic clearing systems in which foreign market participants often do not have custody arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.46,0)">Another possible barrier, which may need to be overcome gradually, is the application of different legal frameworks in the national repo markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In order to enhance cross-border integration, there is a need for a legal framework as harmonised as possible in terms of aspects such as the protection of the interests of market participants, the scope of application of the settlement laws for securities transactions, the legal documentation for transactions in the repo market, and finally, the fiscal treatment of securities transactions across the participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.75,0)">Indeed, several initiatives are already being taken to overcome the barrier resulting from the technical infrastructure for transferring collateral across different national securities settlement systems, even if they may, to a certain extent, have been delayed by the preparatory work for the Year 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">We have also seen some recent developments aiming at further harmonising the relevant regulatory framework and at establishing standardised repo agreements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The most important initiative in the area of harmonisation is the European Commission's "Financial Market Action Plan", which was approved by the EcoFin in May and endorsed by the Heads of States and Governments at the meeting of the European Council in June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.24,0)">Turning to developments in the bond market, it is important to point out that the process of integration of euro area capital markets had already started before the launch of the euro, as evidenced by the reduction in spreads between the various euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In the government debt market, there are several signs that this process is continuing and that the market is undergoing structural change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Positive signs include indications that banks have reorganised their trading activity by segment of the euro yield curve rather than by nationality of the issuer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">In the absence of currency diversification, investors are also reported to be paying more attention to credit diversification or instrument diversification as a means to enhance the return on their portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">With regard to the issuing governments themselves, the co-ordination of issuance calendars is certainly a very encouraging sign for the bond market and its participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">An important change in the bond market is that competition among government issuers has increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The most evident aspect of this is the search for the benchmark status of the most liquid bond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Issuers are participating in this competition by increasing the available stock of each bond by re-opening issues and refining the issuing methods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The liquidity premium has also gained in importance and all of the issuers are actively trying to improve liquidity through increases in issue size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.85,0)">Indeed, these are signs consistent with expectations that with the diminishing importance of the notion of "national" markets, funds will most likely be managed against euro-wide benchmarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Furthermore, the use of a variety of instruments and the achievement of major volumes in futures and options contracts denominated in euro are natural by-products of the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">These developments are certainly positive indicators of a developed market with a diversity of instruments offered to market participants, contributing to depth and liquidity in the euro area bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Other traditional issuers in the European bond market, such as financial and industrial institutions, have reacted promptly to the introduction of the euro, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">The most evident aspect of this is the qualitative and quantitative growth of the market in bonds issued vis-à-vis mortgages and loans to the public sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In one of the most important segments of this market, the German market for Pfandbriefe, issues have increased significantly in the first months of 1999 compared with the same period last year, in particular because of the large increase in issues in excess of half a billion euro, the so-called Jumbo Pfandbriefe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Besides an increase in the amounts, increased demand from non-euro area investors has been registered by market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is true that the growth of these instruments seems to have mainly been concentrated in certain euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">But there is also evidence that this market has started to expand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">In this respect, I should especially like to mention the fact that an international mortgage bond was issued in Spain at the beginning of this quarter, while in France, the Government recently passed legislation that will enable the development of a mortgage market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.93,0)">However, full integration of these markets may still be difficult, owing to the different legislative and regulatory approaches pursued by the different national authorities in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">With regard to bond issues by the industrial sector, this was and is an undersized sector and, indeed, an area in which a lot of progress is expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The signs of progress already observed, which I should like to emphasise, are increases in issue size and in the demand from companies for new ratings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">These are both indications of growing interest among companies in directly accessing the credit markets instead of relying heavily on bank intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In this respect, some unprecedented corporate issues of several billions of euro have already taken place during the first half of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">According to data providers, there has indeed been a substantial increase in the average size of those issues in the first five months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">An additional sign of increased securitisation in the corporate sector is that there has been an increase in issues with a rating inferior to the maximum, thus increasing the number of potential issuers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In particular, the relative share of issues with single A as well as B ratings have increased - these are only early indications of the growth of the corporate bond market in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The increased width and depth of the euro capital market will naturally further induce companies to issue debt as a way to finance their activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.97,0)">As to equity markets, equity investment and trading activities appear, like the bond market, to be influenced less and less by country-specific factors and more and more by euro area-wide considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Area-wide equity indices have been developed and, as a result of the high degree of interest in these among investors, sub-indices covering area-wide industrial sectors have been created.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The creation of these euro area-wide indices has also led to intense competition for benchmark status between the different supporters of these indices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Furthermore, with regard to the infrastructure of stock exchanges, the euro has provided a strong incentive for the creation of new alliances among Europe's exchanges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me now turn to developments in the foreign exchange markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Certainly, one of the most important changes in the foreign exchange market has been that the single currency has reduced transaction costs for many companies that do business within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Also, for companies competing in the global markets, hedging costs are certainly lower in a large currency area with a market that provides greater opportunities for hedging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It is interesting to underline that, right from the outset, the euro established itself, alongside the US dollar and the Japanese yen, as one of the three poles of the foreign exchange markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">According to our understanding, the euro has successfully replaced the Deutsche Mark as the second most used international currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Euro/dollar trading is the most active and liquid segment of the foreign exchange market at the global level, and does indeed provide a variety of instruments and substantial hedging possibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.56,0)">At the same time, bid-ask spreads have remained around the same levels as those for dollar/Mark trading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.8,0)">With regard to the functioning of the market in other currency pairs, it seems that euro/yen activity and liquidity do not, so far, match the level of the euro/dollar pair or, perhaps even those of the former, Mark/yen pair.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.22,0)">In the absence of data, it is of course difficult to assess the true dimension of this development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Still, even though we recognise that there has been an improvement in liquidity compared with the early phases of Monetary Union, there is a widespread feeling that the euro/yen market is still not as liquid and deep as that for the euro/dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The Euro/yen pair seems to be mainly traded using the dollar as a vehicle currency and the bid-ask spread is slightly wider than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.91,0)">Of course, liquidity and spread developments in the foreign exchange market have to be put into the context of general foreign exchange market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.03,0)">It seems that there has been a general decrease in global foreign exchange turnover compared with last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.06,0)">Clearly, the abolishment of the euro area currencies, some of which were very actively traded with each other, may have contributed to a fall in global turnover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.96,0)">Moreover, the financial turmoil in the aftermath of the financial crises in Russia and Brazil and the extraordinary volatility of the yen exchange rate last autumn are factors that have reportedly led to an increase in risk aversion among investors, and even among banks themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">All in all, the euro has established itself as an important international currency in the foreign exchange markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">The issuance activity from non-euro area issuers also points to the euro as an international currency for funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The international role of the euro was also emphasised recently when the Eurosystem was asked by the Japanese authorities to operate in the foreign exchange market on their behalf.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.46,0)">I should like to stress that this was not an ECB intervention, but rather an operation undertaken on behalf of the Japanese authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The ECB was acting as an agent, meaning that all settlements were made between the Japanese authorities and the commercial banks involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Finally, as I promised, I should like to reflect on exchange rate developments and to assess their significance for the success of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Developments in this regard have merited much attention recently, although in my view the focus and the analysis have often been over simplified and out of proportion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.24,0)">There are several arguments for this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">First, structural longer-term developments such as, for instance those I have mentioned today, are much more relevant for the success of the euro than short-term exchange rate developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Second, exchange rate changes, too, have to be seen in the context of overall economic fundamentals and longer-term historical developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.44,0)">Third, future opportunities and prospects are not taken into account in most of these assessments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.55,0)">Since its inception, the euro has depreciated by around 11 % against the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.86,0)">In effective terms, it has depreciated by some 8 %.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This means that the current effective exchange rate level broadly corresponds to that observed in the summer and autumn of 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The longer-term context is the analytical framework within which central banks set their policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.99,0)">The depreciation of the euro is mainly attributable to differences between the strong US economy and the remaining hesitations facing that of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.04,0)">Towards the end of last year, the dollar was weakening owing to concerns in the market place about the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">This year, however, economic data for output and unemployment in the United States have continuously been more positive than expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.06,0)">Economic data for the euro area have, during the same period, been more muted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">We should therefore primarily speak about the strength of the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">This is emphasised by developments of short and long-term interest rate differentials between the euro area and the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The spread between euro-denominated assets and US dollar-denominated assets has widened significantly since the start of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.9,0)">All in all, the depreciation of the euro is to a large extent perceived as a cyclical phenomenon and not as a sign of structural problems or even a lack of credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In fact, prospects for future economic developments in the euro area are in many ways quite favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">First, the inflation rate of the euro area has remained very stable, at a level consistent with the definition of price stability as defined by the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The current level of year-on-year increase in consumer prices is 1%, and expectations of future inflation testify to strong confidence in future price stability, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Second, the difference in growth between the United States and the euro area is expected to narrow quite soon; we have seen already many positive signs of a revival in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Third, even if there were some concerns, a while ago, about fiscal discipline and structural policies in the euro area, the prospects for stability-oriented fiscal policies and for the necessary structural measures have clearly strengthened recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The short-term developments experienced in the exchange rate reflect to a degree the well-established fact that financial markets often concentrate their attention on short-term news rather than focus on medium-term macroeconomic fundamentals and structural changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The Eurosystem is monitoring price developments and developments in financial markets within the context of its monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Within this strategy, the exchange rate is an important indicator for the assessment of the outlook for future price developments and the risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, the value of the euro is not a target in itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.3,0)">There are no signs that the euro exchange rate poses any threat whatsoever to price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.78,0)">The short-term-oriented frame-work within which financial markets often work has been emphasised too much in the debate on the overall functioning of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">However, any judgement of the success of Economic and Monetary Union and the single currency can only be made in the context of long-term economic, structural and political developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Concluding remarks I wish to conclude my presentation by underlining that the first six months of Economic and Monetary Union have shown that both the Eurosystem's decision-making process, as well as its operational procedures, are working well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">There is no reason to call into question the Eurosystem's ability to deliver efficiently its primary objective required by the Maastricht Treaty, price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">The logic behind this primary objective is clear: by ensuring price stability, expectations are stabilised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">In an environment with credible expectations of low inflation, interest rates remain low and stable, which helps consumers and investors to plan for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Expectations of low and stable inflation contribute to a moderation of wage demands and price setting, thus further fostering the low-inflation environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Experience has shown that the best contribution monetary policy can make to promoting growth, employment and other aspects of economic welfare is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Nonetheless, the role of fiscal and structural policies, and the role of the private sector in the success of the euro, should not be underestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The credibility of the euro necessitates confidence in the continuation of the overall stability-oriented framework and policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The success of the new currency also depends on the ability of the private sector - not least the financial services industry and financial markets - to respond to the challenges of the new environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Personally, I am optimistic that the role of the euro as one of the world's leading currencies will strengthen further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The structural developments in the euro area financial markets show that the introduction of the single currency is delivering the expected improvements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.75,0)">The integration of the European economies has proceeded so far that it must be considered irreversible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The integration is no longer a result of political decisions alone, but also a consequence of profound developments and integration in the markets.</span>
