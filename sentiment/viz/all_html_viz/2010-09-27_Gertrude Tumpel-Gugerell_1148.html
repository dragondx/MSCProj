    <span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)"> The interplay of banking, financial intermediation and regulation Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 13th Conference of the ECB-CFS Research Network on “Macro-prudential Regulation as an Approach to Contain Systemic Risk: Economic Foundations, Diagnostic Tools and Policy Instruments”, Frankfurt am Main, 27 September 2010 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a real pleasure for me to speak today at the 13th Conference of the ECB-CFS Research Network on “Macro-prudential Regulation as an Approach to Contain Systemic Risk”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.76,0)">The Roman senator and historian Tacitus tells us that in 33 A.D. the Roman Empire suffered a major financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The trigger was a re-establishment of laws that Julius Caesar had introduced as a war measure in 49 B.C.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.12,0)">to prevent the flight of capital abroad and the fall of land values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.43,0)">After having been disregarded for a long time the re-introduction of the laws, which forced lenders to invest a large share of their capital in domestic real estate, triggered a scramble for money as many loans were called in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.44,0)">The disastrous effect was a postponement of investment and a fall in real estate values, compounded by investors withholding funding in view of the prospect of finding better bargains in a falling market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The crisis was eventually ended when Emperor Tiberius arranged for three-year interest free loans to investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Although the global crisis of the last few years had little to do with drastic measures of war financing of the Roman kind, the involvement of real estate, elements of the transmission and aspects of the resolution still sound familiar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.0,0)">These analogies are not isolated examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The long list of financial crises in human history and their parallels over time have been extensively documented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">One of the key issues – today and in history – has been that there were limited means to contain the systemic dimension of crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Hence, the recent focus on macro-prudential supervision and the topic chosen for this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The regulation of systemic risk is very topical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In my remarks today, I would like to look a bit more at the issue how financial regulation should react to instances of widespread or systemic instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I shall do that from two angles: First, I want to look back at regulatory reactions in the past, namely the Glass-Steagall Act in the United States and the establishment of the Basel Committee and its standards at the international level, and, second, I want to consider the particular challenges we are facing for the current regulatory reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.43,0)">How has regulatory policy reacted to the occurrence of financial instabilities in the past?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.02,0)">One prominent example is the regulatory reaction to the stock market crash in 1929, which resulted in the establishment of the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.1,0)">The Act was to a large extent motivated by concerns about the role of banks in the run up to the Great Depression and in particular about conflicts of interest between the lending, underwriting and proprietary trading functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.41,0)">Therefore, the Glass Steagall Act banned commercial banks from underwriting, holding or dealing in corporate securities, hence essentially separating investment from commercial banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The Act not only had a major impact on the evolution of banking in the US, but also worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.74,0)">For instance, the emergence of large US investment banks, also with dependencies in Europe, is a direct consequence from the implementation of this Act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.65,0)">The Act also affected the supervision of banks worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.94,0)">Owing to their funding structure based on deposits by many small and relatively uninformed agents, hence the possibility of a bank run and their involvement in the payment system, commercial banks were regulated relatively heavily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.57,0)">In contrast, investment banks were regarded to need less close public monitoring and regulation, as they were seen to be less important from an overall financial stability perspective and mostly the domain of sophisticated investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.43,0)">However, the crisis has shown that all actors in the financial system contributed to the build up of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.56,0)">Research on the pre-Glass-Steagall-era in the United States provides evidence that securities underwritten by commercial banks’ subsidiaries did not have a higher probability of default than those underwritten by investment banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.2,0)">However, whether the Glass Steagall Act has contributed or not to financial stability is an open question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Nonetheless, in 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed the Glass Steagall Act on the grounds that this would allow banks to become more competitive, attain favorable economies of scope and diversify their sources of income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, the recent regulatory reform in the US under the Frank-Dodd Bill has re-introduced some restrictions on proprietary trading by deposit taking institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">A regulatory response with a worldwide impact on regulatory standards and banks’ business was the creation of the Basel Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.34,0)">The failure of the German Herstatt bank led to serious spill-overs to the US banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In late 1974, central bankers from Canada, Japan, the US and 9 European countries founded a new body at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, which became later known as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This new organization was founded on the understanding that the increasing cross-border activities of banks and the associated risk that financial instability would be transmitted across borders required improvements in the quality of supervision and regulation globally as well as greater international cooperation in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Over the years it has increasingly developed into a standard-setting body and although its standards – such as Basel I and Basel II – are not legally enforceable they have in fact become the worldwide benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.35,0)">The list of factors that contributed to the financial crisis is long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.94,0)">However, irrespective of the multiplicity of factors, we had to realize that the provisions put in place by Basel I and Basel II were not sufficient to ensure the necessary resilience of the banking sector needed to withstand a situation like the one we are currently facing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In my view, the major lessons from the current crisis for any future regulatory policy are the following: First, Basel II rested on the principle that the purpose of regulation is to ensure the safety and soundness of individual financial institutions against the risk of loss on their assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">However ensuring the soundness of each individual institution does not necessarily ensure the soundness of the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Second, the crisis has highlighted that the main types of risk, notably credit, market and liquidity risk are ultimately linked, and that funding liquidity of banks is an essential element of determining their resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.56,0)">Awareness about the importance of regulating liquidity risk was limited until the crisis brought it to the fore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And third, part of banks’ risk taking activities were left to other, non-bank entities of the financial system and, thus, these activities were able to escape the regulatory web that had been built for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Already from these three points we see how the lessons learnt lead us to the systemic dimension of supervision and regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The current regulatory challenge So let me turn to the challenges of the current regulatory reform to discuss what is needed to prevent or contain financial instabilities and systemic crises in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">These challenges concern three major fields:   classic bank regulation,   market and infrastructure regulation, and   systemic risk regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Regulating banks Concerning the bank regulation, major progress has been made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The Basel Committee has just published the regulatory reform package known as Basel III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.05,0)">It addresses the weaknesses brought to the fore by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The aim of the Basel III reform is to enhance capital regulation and to introduce liquidity regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In particular the Basel Committee proposes: first, to improve the quality and quantity of capital, especially Tier-1 capital to improve loss-absorption on a going concern basis; second, to introduce a non-risk-based leverage ratio as a supplementary measure to the Basel II risk control framework; third, to introduce capital buffers and forward-looking provisioning to ensure that the financial system absorbs the shocks and thus lowers the volatility of the financial and real economic cycles; finally, to elevate resilience of financial institutions to liquidity stresses by introducing a liquidity risk framework, improving liquidity risk management and harmonising liquidity risk supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The significance of internationally coordinated oversight and the cross-border web of dependencies in the financial system are exemplified by systemically important financial institutions   that often operate internationally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">These played a major role in both the impact and the transmission of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">In order to increase long term financial stability there is the need to reduce the moral hazard they exhibit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">To address this, policy recommendations are being developed that include:   a framework for measuring an institution’s systemic importance,   resolution tools and frameworks for the effective resolution of financial failures without taxpayers ultimately bearing the burden, as well as   prudential and structural policy tools to reduce the probability and impact of SIFI’s failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Looking further ahead, important challenges remain to improve banking sector stability: First, banks’ business models need to become more sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In my view, banks’ business strategy should not be directed towards increasing short-term profits by way of taking on extensive risks to the detriment of the long term viability of their business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In fact, the level of announced profit targets and their impact on peer banks has also to be seen from the perspective that higher profits mean higher risk taking and, hence, do not necessarily originate from efficiency gains alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Second, I believe that it is crucial for banks to undergo a serious reform of their corporate governance and compensation schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In particular, the incentives of traders, CEOs and creditors of the bank should adequately reflect the risks involved so as to internalize the costs of their risk taking and potential failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This can be achieved through appropriate compensation schemes, more transparency vis-à-vis creditors and shareholders and generally improved oversight of banks’ business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Overall, the managing board of a bank has to shift the focus away from short-term objectives towards a longer term corporate strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This also includes being more accountable for the risk taking of the overall business of the bank, which brings me to the next challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Third, risk management practises need to be improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.12,0)">Most risk management techniques – not just used by banks but also by rating agencies – neglected the correlations of risks across securities and did not sufficiently internalize the growing systemic   risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.07,0)">Moreover, banks underestimated tail risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.48,0)">The existing risk management techniques worked well at predicting small day-to-day losses under normal circumstances but failed to predict severe losses that are very infrequent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.69,0)">However, it is exactly those severe losses that matter the most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Therefore, banks need to devote greater attention to their risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This means in particular that the risk management function needs to receive a more prominent role in the organizational structure, specifically with respect to authority and independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.42,0)">Regulating markets and infrastructures Concerning the regulation of financial markets, the crisis has clearly shown that turbulences in one segment of financial markets can create spill-overs and contagion to other segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.91,0)">Moreover, we have seen that both banks and other types of financial intermediaries had been seriously affected by the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Therefore, I welcome the recent agreement to establish three pan-European micro-prudential supervisory authorities – the European Banking Authority  , the European Securities Markets Authority   and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">They are expected to become operational at the beginning of next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">With regard to the regulation of market infrastructures, let me first say that I see it as a great achievement that market infrastructures have fared very well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">They were able to withstand the shock-waves of the current crisis and continued to ensure the clearing and settlement of financial transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Thus, they contributed critically to containing the spreading of financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This resilience, however, was not a “dues ex machine”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">It was the outcome of well designed international standards for market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Still, we need to closely analyse the lessons from the crisis also in this area – e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">in terms of market infrastructure risk management and transparency and the arrangements for cross-border cooperation among authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">These lessons will be incorporated in the global CPSS-IOSCO recommendations for financial market infrastructures to be issued early next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Despite the good performance of market infrastructures, there is a need to further develop highly resilient market infrastructures, particularly in the field of OTC derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">The crisis showed that legislation, supervision and oversight of global derivatives market arrangements need to be improved – and that this needs to be done in a consistent way globally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Following agreement by the G20 on high-level objectives, new legislation has recently been introduced in the US and is in an advanced stage in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.18,0)">Such legislation stipulates, inter alia, that all OTC derivatives trades will need to be reported to trade repositories and to the extent possible be subject to central clearing via a central counterparty  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Overall, also with regard to regulating markets and infrastructures, important challenges remain: First, striving for more transparency in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The activities in the shadow banking sector and the over-the-counter business have contributed tremendously to the creation of uncertainties and opaque transmission channels for risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Therefore, a central goal for any future regulatory action should the improvement of market transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Clearing of OTC derivatives via CCPs, the reporting of derivative trade data to trade repositories and the recent proposal by the European Commission to increase transparency for shortselling activities are important steps in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Second, dealing with financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.55,0)">Independently of the doubtless benefits of financial innovation, it poses a constant challenge to regulators, supervisors and overseers of financial markets and infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.76,0)">The banking business is in a constant state of flux with new financial instruments constantly being developed and traded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">New techniques and instruments have been developed, particularly to diversify and trade credit risk, making markets more complex and sometimes less transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.77,0)">For example, the risks involved in the so-called “Originate to Distribute” model - an intermediation approach in which banks originate, repackage and then sell their loans   on to the financial market - was insufficiently recognized by market participants and supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Therefore, financial innovation and growing complexity mean that market participants and authorities need to constantly build up in-depth knowledge of financial innovations and broaden their analysis across the whole spectrum of financial market actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Third, minimization of risk transmission between institutions and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Given the resilience of market infrastructures in the current crisis, we need to further strengthen and encourage their use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.07,0)">Moreover, the crisis has shown that the exclusive focus on banks has proven insufficient as contagion has also occurred across different types of financial intermediaries, such as insurance companies and money market funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Therefore, looking forward it will be crucial that the cross border cooperation between authorities be further strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">In this respect the work of the newly created European Supervisory Authorities will be key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Looking more into the interrelation between markets from a systemic perspective will be another key task, which brings me to the third major field of regulatory challenge, namely regulating systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Regulating systemic risk As indicated, traditional banking regulation was designed to limit each individual institution's risk seen in isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.04,0)">It did not sufficiently focus on systemic risk, put simply, the risk of a simultaneous collapse of institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Institutionally, significant progress has been made in the strengthening of macro- and micro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In Europe, the European Systemic Risk Board   and – as mentioned - three pan-European micro Supervisors will be established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The ESRB will provide a thorough analysis of systemic risks to the financial system in the European Union and will issue warnings if significant risks are identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">It will also provide policy recommendations to address these risks and prevent a renewed build-up of excessive risk in the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">With its involvement in the ESRB, the ECB will continue to play an active role in safeguarding financial stability in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The ECB Vice President will go into greater detail at tonight’s conference dinner on how we are preparing for that task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The main challenges that I see ahead in the area of regulating systemic risk are as follows: First, determining the perimeter of regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">It is important that the regulatory web is cast wide enough to ensure that all systemically important institutions, markets and products are captured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.76,0)">Caution is also necessary to avoid that tighter regulation simply shifts activities to unregulated market segments or entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Therefore, the steps taken towards more harmonised banking supervision as well as the progress made in Europe towards a Directive on alternative investment fund managers, which affect financial markets through their tight web of interlinkages with the financial sector, are appreciated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Second, ensuring the availability of information and data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The detection and the early warning on systemic risk crucially depends on the quality and the availability of relevant data as well as on the adequate assessment of the risk bearing capacity of the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Therefore it is important that information is made available that can feed into future assessments of systemic risk, especially in view of this being a key input into the working of the newly founded ESRB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">In this regard, it will be equally important that the use of qualitative data and market information is strengthened and that this information will be fed into the regular analysis of systemic risk in a more systematic way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And third, measuring systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.16,0)">A basic difficulty in regulating system risk relate to the difficulty in measuring the contribution of individual institutions to systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The importance of an institution for systemic risk is a function of its size, interconnectedness and substitutability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">One way for regulators and private markets to be able to monitor financial institutions and to assess their systemic reach, is to assess the risk of multiple defaults.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.92,0)">Measuring such risk is difficult, as measures may be too backward looking or face data limitations..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">I am happy that after the break we will have the chance to hear about the latest advances on how to measure systemic risk in the keynote speech by Professor Robert Engle from New York University.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">He has developed a measure of systemic risk capturing the systemic impact of an individual institution’s shortfall and which is published in the so-called NYU Stern Systemic Risk Ranking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The keynote speech will be followed by two outstanding papers on measuring systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Kim and Giesecke will present a paper estimating systemic risk on the basis of actual defaults and the timing of their occurrence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The paper by Yang and Zhou goes beyond the usual focus on the existence of contagion and will present an analysis of the pattern of propagation across financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">For an illustration showing how big the challenge to identify systemic risk is, one does not need to go back very far in history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">In 2003, a young analyst in New York stated the following: “You just have to watch for the level at which a nearly unlimited or unprecedented credit growth can no longer drive housing markets higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.38,0)">I am extremely bearish and feel the consequence could be a 50% drop in residential real estate in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.6,0)">A large portion of the current   demand at current prices would disappear if only people were convinced that prices were not rising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.21,0)">The collateral damage is likely to be of orders of magnitude worse than anyone now considers”   It took another 4 years that these risks and, particularly, the systemic impact and costs materialized.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.51,0)">Analyzing systemic risk means, therefore, mainly going beyond mainstream thinking and challenging widespread beliefs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We are in need of the type of analyst I just quoted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">I am very much looking forward to hearing this conference’s analysis on the containment of such systemic risk, the future challenges and the possible policy options we have going forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Puri, M.  , “Universal banks as underwriters: Implications for the going public process”, Journal of Financial
