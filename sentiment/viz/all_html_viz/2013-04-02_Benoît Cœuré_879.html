    <span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)"> Currency fluctuations: the limits to benign neglect Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the luncheon panel: Currency Wars and the G-20’s Goal of Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth, Conference on Currency Wars: Economic Realities, Institutional Responses, and the G-20 Agenda, Peterson Institute for International Economics,Washington, DC, 2 April 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen  , I would like to thank the Peterson Institute for the invitation to speak in this panel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.87,0)">In my remarks today, I wish to consider the current debate on competitive devaluations and the peril of a currency war.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.18,0)">Large policy spillovers in an increasingly integrated world economy naturally raise the possibility of inefficiencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.35,0)">National policy-makers, who pursue a domestic objective and ignore the externalities they impose on other countries, may find themselves in equilibria that entail collective welfare losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Policies that are efficient for the global economy are not necessarily optimal from the national vantage point, and there is a temptation to shift the burden and costs of adjustment abroad, and maximise the net gains accruing to national residents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A classic example of the application of this framework to monetary policy is Ragnar Nurkse’s well-known analysis of the devaluations that took place in the interwar period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.35,0)">Since then, concerns about spirals of competitive devaluations have motivated the design of institutions and rules – from the Bretton Woods arrangements of 1944 to the Group of Twenty – to prevent countries from adopting “beggar thy neighbour” policies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The lessons from the crises of the interwar period continue to have an impact on policy discussions today, as the world economy is adjusting to the Great Recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Some central banks in major industrialised countries are currently pursuing, or have announced policy measures to stem entrenched deflationary pressures and bring down unemployment levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Because policy interest rates are at or close to their lower bound in these economies, monetary easing has taken the form of non-standard measures, such as forward guidance concerning the path of future policy rates, and/or quantitative easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.83,0)">These measures have had domestic effects  ; but as it is a standard outcome of monetary policy easing, have also exerted some depreciation pressures on the currency of the respective country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.57,0)">The question I want to address is the following: should policy-makers, especially those in large countries whose currency is appreciating, be concerned by these developments?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.32,0)">Do the latter pose a challenge to the G20 international cooperation policy agenda?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Taking mainly the perspective of a large currency area, I will first outline the conditions under which the answer to the above question is “No”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.92,0)">In the process, I will also argue that there is a misleading “Panglossian” view that is emerging, namely that competitive devaluations are an efficient way to coordinate national policies on the global task of taking the world economy out of a deflationary trap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.31,0)">I will then contend that competitive devaluations, if aggressively pursued, would be quite harmful, due to the constraints faced by policy-makers in most countries in today's environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.39,0)">The case of no concerns about currency manipulations Typically, sustained exchange rate movements affect policy objectives   and hence demand offsetting policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Other things being equal, these policy actions, by resisting the exchange rate movement to a degree, will re-establish the original target outcomes over the relevant horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.85,0)">So, to the extent that such offsetting policy actions are unconstrained and also pose no trade-offs, and the exchange rate is not per se a target  , there is little or no scope for effective currency manipulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.34,0)">This is by and large the environment in which the ECB operates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The exchange rate is not a policy target for the ECB; however, it matters for price stability and growth and, as such, it is part of the overall assessment of the appropriateness of the policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.37,0)">If contrary to the objective of medium term price stability, it may thus trigger offsetting policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.48,0)">An important aspect of the consequences of an exchange rate movement resulting from a monetary policy shock abroad is that it brings about few trade-offs for domestic monetary policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.88,0)">Currency appreciation would tend to have effects of the same sign on inflation and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.48,0)">However, exchange rate movements reflecting other forces, particularly those resulting in severe misalignments, would not have such benign consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.42,0)">Currency swings disconnected from fundamentals, or brought about by misguided policies, have the potential to become disruptive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.58,0)">The empirical evidence on the cross-border effects of standard monetary policy shocks in major economies suggests the following.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.87,0)">A monetary easing, say in the US, while depreciating the dollar, is associated with a fall in net exports and a global output expansion; interest rates also decrease in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Therefore, if foreign policy measures, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.12,0)">in the form of forward guidance, can be readily matched with domestic policy actions, we should not worry about the risk of a loss of competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">In addition, a foreign policy expansion might not require a domestic response that fully neutralises the exchange rate movement if there are sources of overall positive spillovers, in particular through increased foreign demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Objectives in terms of inflation and output gaps can then be achieved despite some currency appreciation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The previous argument should not be confused with an emerging “Panglossian” perspective   which posits that competitive devaluations triggering an exchange rate “arms race” would be welcome in the current conjuncture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The argument put forward is that, contrary to a tariff war that leaves everybody worse off, such a race would generate a needed global, coordinated monetary expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This view rests on the assumption that monetary policy-makers should do more than they are currently doing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Chasing an exchange rate depreciation would make up for a perceived lack of action and deliver the appropriate symmetric policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">However, there is no such lack of action in advanced economies, where monetary policy has been and is likely to remain very accommodative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.72,0)">Moreover, the “Panglossian” approach to coordination may create difficulties of its own, as I shall illustrate later on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.01,0)">Monetary policy limits and the costs of competitive devaluations It would be simplistic to think that countries should always put up with any exchange rate movement generated by policy actions abroad, when the latter aim to address domestic problems and are not carried out through overt currency manipulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.94,0)">Let me list here three reasons why there are limits to non-cooperative policy responses to exchange rate movements following foreign monetary policy shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">First, it is true that starting in the mid-1980s the economic literature by and large finds only modest gains from international policy cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">This consensus, although not undisputed,   has been reinforced by the paradigm shift in international macroeconomic theory from the Mundell-Fleming-Dornbusch model to the New Open Economy Macroeconomics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">However, the workhorse open-economy model underlying those results describes a benign, frictionless environment, with only moderate macroeconomic interdependence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">These theoretical economies are in an ideal state of “divine coincidence”: one policy instrument suffices to achieve all targets, quite independently of policy decisions abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In the real world, a number of market frictions – in particular of a financial nature – have been identified as channels of large cross-country spillovers and, hence, as potential sources of non-trivial gains from cooperation – particularly concerning unconventional policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The ever stronger global integration of trade in goods and services and, in particular, in financial markets makes the issue of central bank cooperation ever more relevant today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Second, a group of large, systemically relevant economies has not been affected symmetrically by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As noted by Barry Eichengreen  , this is an important difference with the interwar period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.99,0)">Insofar as they have decoupled from advanced economies, the main policy concern in emerging market economies has been inflationary pressures, and in some cases, growth rates and asset prices that are too strong rather than too weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Rather than resorting to tighter macroeconomic policies, these countries may instead be tempted to fight back against currency appreciation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.73,0)">To deal with the ensuing pro-cyclical bias, they might opt for second-best measures designed to limit capital inflows and/or moderate their domestic impact; the effectiveness of which remains unascertained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.73,0)">Likewise, small open economies which find it desirable to peg their exchange rates also have little room to react, unless the easing is undertaken in their anchor currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.35,0)">Even then, their ability to deliver domestic monetary easing may be hampered by the lack of domestic assets available for quantitative easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Third, central banks in the advanced countries are close to reaching the limits of their conventional policies, or are already undertaking unconventional ones, such as quantitative easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.23,0)">The operational difficulties that would surround additional non-standard measures and doubts over their traction on domestic aggregate demand suggest that there is at least an implicit cost in responding to further negative developments, as an exchange rate appreciation would be for many economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.49,0)">This is particularly likely to be the case when the transmission of monetary policy is hampered by persistent structural rigidities, as it is the case in large parts of the euro area today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">In situations in which it becomes difficult to generate monetary policy stimuli for domestic economies, the “coordinated” expansion unwittingly resulting from a currency war would not provide more room for manoeuvre for policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.71,0)">To the contrary, the “Panglossian” approach may only result in a global inflationary bias.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.54,0)">In the light of these constraints, it would be a matter of concern if countries were to directly pursue overt competitive devaluations, particularly by resorting to large purchases of foreign assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.4,0)">Moving to expenditure-switching policies would in effect create a zero sum game and expose global markets to serious risks of an escalation of trade and financial protectionism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Conclusion As much as exchange rate movements are the natural result of policies aimed at achieving sound and legitimate domestic targets, such as price stability, and as long as other central banks are not constrained in their ability to take offsetting actions, there is no reason for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.73,0)">Keeping one’s own house in order, however, is quite different from sticking one’s head in the sand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.23,0)">Especially in the current conjuncture, the room for policy actions might be reduced, or countervailing interventions might have become more costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.48,0)">Then, large and sustained currency swings might hinder the achievement of domestic targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">I am inclined to believe that global economic circumstances are currently far from the ideal case of “divine coincidence” where one policy instrument would suffice to achieve all targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.71,0)">Although they are on a clear path to recovery, financial markets in advanced economies are still fragile and the real economy is at best giving timid signs of improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.56,0)">There are some concerns that non-standard policies would not gain enough traction on domestic aggregate demand because of deleveraging by domestic agents, including banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This would leave the exchange rate as the residual macro-policy instrument, with forward guidance but especially quantitative easing mainly operating via external channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.46,0)">Under these circumstances, the temptation to divert global demand and foreign capital towards the domestic economy at the expense of other ailing countries could be dangerously alluring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">It is during times like these that the international community has to display an ability to reach mutually beneficial agreements, while recognising the legitimate ambition of each country to solve its domestic problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.8,0)">The economic literature highlights the dangers of individual countries pursuing “beggar they neighbour” or “burden-shifting” policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">I believe this message is well understood by central bankers We strive to conduct policies in a cooperative spirit as much as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">There have been several initiatives at global level to foster monetary cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The commitment by G20 leaders to build a more stable and resilient international monetary system, as reaffirmed at the Cannes summit, is echoed for instance in the CGFS report on global liquidity  , which develops a framework for the analysis of global liquidity cycles, as well as in the IMF’s work on the multilateral aspects of policies affecting global capital flows  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">The recent G7 statement on exchange rates also reflects this cooperative spirit, as well as the G20 communiqué subsequently adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This kind of cooperation seems different from the way it is treated in theoretical models, where cooperation takes the form of policy-makers agreeing on a configuration of policies to maximise global welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.44,0)">I do not think this difference matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">For me, the main value added coming from the economic literature consists in identifying and quantifying the implications for welfare of spillovers across economies and policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Cooperation between the ECB and other major central banks is and will remain extensive and effective, building on a common ground of shared experience and mutual trust.</span>
