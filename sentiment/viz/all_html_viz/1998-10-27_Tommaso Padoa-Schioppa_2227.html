    <span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)"> The impact of the introduction of the euro on ACP countries and particularly on the CFA franc zone Speech by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Committee on Development and Co-operation on 27 October 1998 European Parliament, Brussels Introduction I am both honoured and pleased to contribute to the proceedings of this Committee of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.29,0)">As you are aware the President of the ECB intends to appear regularly before the European Parliament in its plenary sessions or at the level of the Sub-Committee for Monetary Affairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is meant to be an important part of the communication policy of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Against this background, it seems also appropriate for Executive Board members to take part in the proceedings of European Parliament Committees when they deal, as it is the case today with the Development and Co-operation Committee, with matters that are relevant for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The introduction of the euro is the most momentous event in the international monetary system since the end   of the Bretton Woods system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The EU as a whole has developed trade and financial relations with 71 countries   through the so-called Lomé Convention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Since the fourth Lomé Convention will expire in February 2000, the European Union and ACP countries started on 30 September 1998 negotiations regarding future arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In addition, France has maintained a long-standing economic and monetary co-operation with 14 African countries and the Comoros  , which are members of the ACP group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Together with its African counterparts, France has expressed its intention to maintain the broad features of the existing arrangements with the CFA franc zone, by substituting the euro for the French franc from 1 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">The international implications of the euro for non-EU countries having close links with the Community have recently attracted a great deal of attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In addition to the Central and Eastern European countries and the Mediterranean countries, the potential impact on the African countries, which account for most of the ACP members  , has also been assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">As regards specifically the CFA franc zone, it is also of interest to note that a Council Decision on a pegging of the CFA franc and the Comorian franc to the euro is currently under preparation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The ECB has been involved in this preparation and delivered an opinion in the context of a consultation procedure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In my remarks, I will focus, first, on the potential economic impact of the euro on ACP countries and particularly on the CFA franc zone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I will, then, turn to the preparation of a Council Decision concerning the CFA franc and the Comorian franc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Economic impact of the euro on ACP and CFA franc zone countries As a general remark, I will first note that the ACP countries, and particularly the African countries, are less affected by the current slowdown of the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">This is partly because the bulk of their trade is with the EU   and also because their exports have been less affected by the overall decline in commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Specifically, the CFA franc zone is forecast to grow at least 4.5% this year, while maintaining very low   inflation rates: less than 5% in most of the 15 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The introduction of the euro will benefit the world economy if it contributes to higher growth in the euroland and to the maintenance of low inflation and interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">This, however, will also depend on efforts being made to reduce European unemployment through structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Also, the development of integrated, liquid and efficient markets in euro will facilitate access to international bond financing by non-euro governments and private entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Economic developments in the euro area will affect ACP countries, and particularly the CFA franc zone, through three main channels: - first, an impact on growth, through existing trade linkages; - second, price and exchange rate stability through the use of the euro as a nominal anchor; - and, third, an improved access to international capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.92,0)">As far as downside risks are concerned, the future exchange rate of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar seems to be the main source of concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Impact on growth through trade linkages A potential strengthening of economic growth in the euro area is bound to benefit its trading partners, like the ACP, through increased exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In 1996, trade with the EU accounted for 51% of total external trade of the CFA franc zone countries and for 42% for the other 33 African ACP countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.36,0)">By contrast, the share of the non-African ACP countries was much lower  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">According to IMF estimates, a 1% increase in euro area GDP induces an increase of the CFA franc countries' exports and GDP of 0.6% and 0.2%, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The other African ACP countries are also likely to benefit from similar positive trade linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">However, the potential impact on non-African ACP countries is bound to be more subdued in view of their limited trade link.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Price and exchange rate stability through the euro peg For CFA franc zone countries, shifting the peg form the French franc to the euro will contribute to stabilizing the nominal effective exchange rate of the area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is due to the fact that the EU accounts for 51% of the external trade of the CFA franc zone, while the share of France is only 25%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In addition, the maintainance of price stability in the euro area will also enable the CFA franc zone to keep comparatively low inflation, with a positive impact on the real exchange rate and on external competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The benefits of nominal and real exchange rate stability will be the greater, the higher the stability of the euro vis-à-vis the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Moreover, in the longer run, the CFA franc zone countries, which mostly export primary commodities priced in US dollars, would benefit from a greater use of the euro for quoting prices on commodity markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Improved access to international capital markets These positive growth and price effects will be supported by improved access of CFA franc zone countries to the European financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Capital movements between the CFA franc zone and the entire euro area, and not only France, are expected to be liberalized after the pegging of the CFA franc to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This, together with the ongoing trade liberalization within the CFA franc zone, should help the zone to reap the benefits from globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">However, this will take time and will also depend on the pursuit of sound macroeconomic policies and the strengthening of domestic financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In the short run, given that in 10 out of the 15 CFA franc zone countries the US dollar and the Japanese yen account for the largest share of their long-term external debt, these countries might have an interest in increasing the share of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This would be advisable in view of the exchange rate risk associated with the US dollar and yen denomination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.24,0)">The euro's exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar as main risk factor The main risk of pegging to the euro would be the loss of external competitiveness that could arise form an appreciation of the euro against the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.11,0)">Price stability will be the primary objective of the ECB and, thus, an active management of the euro against other major currencies is not desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.8,0)">This does not mean that the ECB will not take account of the external value of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Exchange rates will continue to be monitored informally by the three main economic and currency blocs, although in the context of new institutional arrangements to be devised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The introduction of the euro may in fact strengthen policy co-ordination between the US, Japan and Europe and contribute to exchange rate stability worldwide, as domestic economic policies in the three regions aim at internal stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.44,0)">Of course, in the shorter-term, there may still be fluctuations in exchange rates, owing to differences in cyclical positions and associated policy responses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">But, in the medium term, confidence in the ability and willingness of the ECB to achieve monetary stability and the overall strength of the Euroland will be the basis for a stable currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This will benefit the CFA franc zone countries too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me now turn to the preparation of a Council Decision concerning exchange rate matters relating to the CFA franc and the Comorian franc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.38,0)">Preparation of a EU Council Decision concerning exchange rate matters relating to the CFA franc and the Comorian franc France's relations with the CFA franc countries and the Comoros are not dealt with specifically in the Maastricht Treaty unlike, for instance, the relations of France with its overseas territories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">However, the Treaty provides for the possibility of monetary and foreign exchange arrangements with third countries, pursuant to Article 109  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In the first half of 1998, the members of the Monetary Committee discussed this matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">On the basis of these discussions and in accordance with Article 109  , the Commission presented on 1 July 1998 a recommendation for a EU Council Decision concerning exchange rate matters relating to the CFA franc and the Comorian franc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">This recommendation allows France to maintain the basic features of the present agreement with the CFA franc zone, for two main economic reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">First, the present guarantee of convertibility of the CFA franc against the French franc is based on a budgetary commitment from the French treasury without any involvement of the Banque de France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">In Stage Three, the French treasury will guarantee an unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euro, without any monetary policy implication for the Banque de France or the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.68,0)">Second, the possible impact on monetary conditions in the euro area of the guarantee of convertibility of the CFA franc vis-à-vis the euro would be extremely limited, given the relative sizes of the euro area and the CFA franc zone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Having consulted the ECB on a first draft, the ECOFIN Council will consider a new text in one of its forthcoming meetings in November or in December of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In its opinion expressed on 22 September 1998, which has been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities, the ECB considered in particular that: by authorising France to establish a fixed link between the CFA franc and the euro, neither the Community, nor the ECB will become party to this agreement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This implies that the primary objective of the Community's monetary policy, which is to maintain price stability, will not be compromised; no obligation of the ESCB may be implied from neither the principle of convertibility of the CFA franc, nor from any modifications to the agreement; the agreement does not set a precedent with respect to any arrangements that may be decided in the future; the ECB should, along with the Commission and the future Economic and Financial Committee, be involved in the decisions taken by the parties to the agreement through prior notification or consultation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.08,0)">I cannot elaborate at this stage on the points requiring prior notification or consultation, since I do not wish to prejudge a EU Council decision that is not yet final.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Conclusion On a more general note, let me state, by way of conclusion, that the ECB regards co-operation with non-European countries as a relevant part of its international responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">We are therefore closely monitoring the negotiation and conclusion of exchange rate arrangements with third countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We are convinced that the favourable economic fundamentals prevailing in the euro area make the introduction of the euro a stabilising factor for the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The pursuit by the ECB of a policy ensuring price stability is the best contribution we can make to international co-operation in general and in our relations with the ACP countries in particular.</span>
