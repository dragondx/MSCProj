    <span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)"> New economy, financial markets and monetary policy Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the meeting of the Zürcher   How should monetary policy-makers deal with the resulting financial imbalances and reconcile monetary stability with financial stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In my presentation today, I shall first briefly discuss the challenges that have been presented by the new environment for monetary policy-makers, in particular by the "new economy" and the growing importance of capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.39,0)">Then, I shall look at what I call the excesses of this new environment, which for me are the speculative boom in asset markets and evidence of a corporate culture infatuated by short-term considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Finally, I shall look at the financial stability concerns and conclude by presenting some lessons for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The paradigm of the "new economy" Without a doubt, the world has experienced overwhelming progress in technology and productivity over the previous century, resulting in enormous growth in economic activity and individual wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">It has been calculated that the industrialised countries were about 20 times better off at the end of the 20th century than they were a hundred years earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Developments in the technological infrastructure have increasingly been at the forefront of economic discussions in the second half of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">One of the most striking economic events of the last years has been the pace and depth of change in information and communications technologies  , and the discussion about a so-called "new economy" in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There has been no undisputed definition of what should be understood by the term "new economy", but generally it included the following characteristics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">A "new economy" seemed to manifest itself mainly in a permanently higher rate of potential output growth, with gains in productivity driven by technological innovation being the main force behind the upsurge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.21,0)">The problem with the "new economy", however, was that the evidence available for the existence of it was fairly mixed, both for the United States and – even more so – for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">On the one hand, some studies, undertaken at the aggregate level, tended to conclude that the data did not warrant an affirmation of a "new economy".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">On the other hand, several microeconomic studies found evidence of significant effects of information technology on firm-level productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">From the beginning, there was, however, only limited, if any, evidence of a "new economy" in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">It was clear that advances in information and telecommunication technology had a major impact on the financial services industry, generating various financial innovations and new business methods, such as internet banking, electronic money, on-line broking services and electronic trading systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.85,0)">For the real economy, however, the impact was much harder to assess, not least due to a lack of reliable statistics and interpretation difficulties regarding "new economy"-related developments in productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.75,0)">As Nobel Prize Laureate Robert Solow said in 1987: "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.07,0)">The difficulty in interpreting these developments therefore suggested caution on the part of policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The interaction of the "new economy" with developments in financial markets Let me now turn to the interaction of the "new economy" with financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It has been long debated what role the development of financial markets played in fostering belief in the "new economy".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">In most industrialised nations, on the waves of financial liberalisation and globalisation, capital markets have been growing tremendously over the past two decades, both in terms of volume and value of transactions and in the development of new types of securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">For the euro area, the preparations for and the actual introduction of the euro have undoubtedly been an important catalyst, improving the efficiency of the euro area capital markets and, to some extent, reducing existing information asymmetries, for both the equity and debt markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">This has certainly been a very positive development which I wholeheartedly support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Coinciding with the stock market boom in the late 1990s and 2000, corporations in the euro area raised significant amounts of equity capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">New companies, often in the high-tech field, obtained listings at specialised "new markets" stock exchanges for high-growth companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The amount of new capital raised on euro area stock markets increased from €130 billion in 1998 to €320 billion in 2000, when stock prices were at their peak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">The growth of the euro area stock markets, in terms of the ratio between market capitalisation and nominal gross domestic product, has been staggering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Over a period of ten years, from 1990 to 2000 – when prices were at their highest level – this ratio increased about fourfold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">With the benefit of hindsight, the belief in enormous potential profits stemming from investments in "new economy" corporations resulted in a stock market rally, which broke all previous records.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Valuations of internet-related companies reached levels that were extraordinary by basically all standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">In March 2000, the monthly average price-earnings ratio of stocks in the technology, media and telecommunications sectors peaked at 70, compared with an average of around 13 over the previous 25 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">It seemed that the sky had finally become the limit indeed and that a new era had arrived.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">In parallel with the rise in stock prices, stock market volatility jumped: the historical volatility of the Nasdaq Composite Index almost doubled from 1999 to 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The excesses, which were particularly evident in the stock markets, are the most notable expression of the interaction of the belief in the "new economy" with developments in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">However, the growth in debt markets also played its role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The introduction of the euro and the start of the single monetary policy seem to have had a strong, positive impact on the possibilities for corporate issuers – both financial and non-financial – to resort to corporate bond issuance as a financing source.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">In addition, this process was fuelled by the surge in mergers and acquisitions, as more and more companies prepared to grasp the opportunities of the new dynamic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Furthermore, issuance activity by certain sectors linked to the "new economy", such as the telecommunications and high-tech sectors, promoted the development of certain segments of the bond markets, for example the market for high-yield bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">We all know where all this optimism about the "new economy" led to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.91,0)">Since March 2000, we have seen both a substantial decline in stock prices and rising financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I shall now discuss the aftermath of the boom and burst period that we experienced in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.8,0)">The aftermath If the famous philosopher Erasmus of Rotterdam were to have lived in our times, he would certainly have added an additional chapter to his satirical masterpiece "The Praise of Folly", with its pointed attacks on human weaknesses and excesses, to describe some of the practices in financial markets and corporate behaviour that have been so blatantly evident in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.01,0)">Some, as we know, have used the expressions "irrational exuberance" and "infectious greed" to describe these developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.73,0)">I have nothing to add to these statements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.04,0)">Unfortunately, when stock prices came down sharply, the costs of the excesses became evidently clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.18,0)">Since their peak in March 2000, stock prices in the euro area – as measured by the broad Dow Jones Euro Stoxx index – have fallen by roughly 57% as at the end of April 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">It has been calculated that buying a thousand Deutsche Marks' worth of beer would have been a better investment than investing the same amount of money in Frankfurt's Neuer Markt at the height of the bubble – at least with the beer you could have made some return by selling the empty cans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.76,0)">The fall in the value of financial assets since 2000, associated with the fall in equity prices, has led to an increase in leverage ratios of non-financial corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.56,0)">The decline in the value of collateral has led to an increase in risk premia when taking up loans or issuing debt securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">This was shown clearly in the spreads of retail bank lending rates over corresponding market rates and in the increasing risk premia on corporate bond interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The ratio of debt of non-financial corporations to GDP, which increased substantially in the second half of the nineties, only started to stabilise last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.19,0)">The relatively high debt levels of non-financial corporations, combined with the decline in the value of financial assets, has had adverse consequences on firms' financing conditions via balance sheet effects and therefore on private investment in particular over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.41,0)">Furthermore, corporations have become increasingly reluctant or have found it more difficult to issue equity capital on public stock exchanges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.4,0)">In 2002, total gross issuance of equity only accounted for around 45% of the annual average for the period 1999-2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.63,0)">In fact, in the second half of 2002, the value of quoted shares issued in the euro area was at its lowest level since the mid-nineties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.37,0)">The slowdown in equity issuance activity in 2001 and 2002 was accompanied by a similar decline in debt securities issuance by non-financial corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.09,0)">These declines in securities financing partly point to lower capital demand following the economic slowdown, but the worsening of capital market sentiment in recent years may also have induced companies to increasingly rely on other sources of finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Furthermore, stock market participation of households in the euro area steadily increased in the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.78,0)">When share prices collapsed, households experienced substantial losses in their financial wealth, bringing the ratio of financial wealth to disposable income back to levels similar to those witnessed at the end of 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.92,0)">The costs of the developments in financial markets over the past few years, which were often linked to the "new economy", can also be measured by a critical erosion of trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.07,0)">Examples of accounting malpractice, corporate greed and imprudent stock market valuations have started to appear in increasing numbers, undermining the basic trust and confidence of investors in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.33,0)">There has been a lot of discussion about whether this unfortunate behaviour has been promoted by the widespread use of certain reward mechanisms such as stock option schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.01,0)">As Alan Greenspan aptly put it: "The highly desirable spread of shareholding and options among business managers perversely created incentives to artificially inflated reported earnings in order to keep stock prices high and rising".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Trust, as has been demonstrated for example by Francis Fukuyama in his best-seller Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity, may be invaluable for economic processes, as it facilitates economic interactions and lowers transaction costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Recent economic research is increasingly emphasising that social capital represented by trust may be as important as physical capital for economic growth and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Policy-makers and regulators can help to restore trust in financial markets and auditing processes by enhancing corporate governance mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">I fully support measures which promote adequate governance of corporate behaviour and thereby contribute to the restoration of trust in financial statements and capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">However, at the end of the day the crucial contribution to restoring trust has to come from the corporate sector itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.03,0)">The sector has to recognise that easy profits are like killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Executives in private business have a collective interest in promoting high standards of ethical behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Monetary policy and financial stability The recent worldwide episodes of substantial asset price swings, with their strong links to the emergence of the "new economy", have intensified the debate among policy-makers regarding the relationship between financial stability and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.37,0)">The question arises as to how monetary policy needs to deal with asset price bubbles, which have often been linked to financial stability concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.23,0)">As is generally accepted, bubbles are situations in which the prices of various types of assets differ from their fundamental market values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.63,0)">Asset price bubbles originate in the existence of imperfect information in financial markets, leading to the mispricing of assets and, in turn, to the distortion of investment and consumption decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Often, asset price bubbles occur in an environment of regime shifts, prompted by major technological innovations, which gave rise to the belief among a broad spectrum of economic agents that a new era had started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In this respect, the impact of the "new economy" on stock prices that we have experienced in recent years has not been that exceptional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.55,0)">However, the importance of asset price bubbles and their potentially distorting impact on economic and financial processes does not mean that central banks should make asset prices an explicit goal for their monetary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.23,0)">This idea has been refuted by many, and rightfully so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Asset prices are predominantly driven by real factors such as technological and demographic developments and preferences, which cannot be controlled by monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.67,0)">Furthermore, economic agents should not be given any cause to act on the basis of expectations that central banks would insure financial markets against considerable losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.61,0)">Otherwise, there would be serious moral hazard problems and the public would hold the central banks accountable for specific developments in financial markets such as the performance of the stock market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.62,0)">This might seriously impair the central banks' goal of pursuing price stability, and thus their credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.68,0)">Central banks also face considerable problems in terms of identifying financial bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.7,0)">After all, a bubble can only be confidently identified as such once it has burst.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.37,0)">However, this does not mean that developments in financial markets, and especially asset price bubbles, are not important for central bank behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">On the contrary, we clearly need to monitor movements in asset prices, as they reflect expectations about future economic developments and are important for the monetary policy transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Furthermore, central banks should always be aware of strong movements in asset prices because of their possible repercussions for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In this sense, asset price developments play a role in our monetary policy decisions to the extent that they reveal relevant information for the state of the economy and the outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">In this respect, our monetary policy strategy, which gives money and credit a very prominent indicator role, is a great aid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.22,0)">Economic history has shown that in many instances strong money and credit growth has accompanied financial bubbles, whose subsequent bursting then endangered financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">To summarise, the best contribution a central bank can make to prevent financial bubbles from forming and bursting is to continue pursuing a monetary policy aimed at maintaining price stability, thereby contributing to a stable macro-economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Conclusions I would now like to conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.39,0)">The famous English economist and essayist Walter Bagehot once said that "No real English gentleman, in his secret soul, was ever sorry for the death of a political economist".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.75,0)">This statement makes us wonder not only about the state of economic science in the 19th century but about the way of thinking of English gentlemen as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Something I do not wonder about is how the increasing importance of new technologies and financial markets clearly presents new challenges for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.94,0)">Underestimating these challenges can be costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.29,0)">However, there are no easy solutions available for monetary policy to deal with asset price bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">With the benefit of hindsight, I can say that the ECB was right to have reacted relatively cautiously when the world discussed the "new economy".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.79,0)">I remember well the criticism we faced in late 1999 when we did not want to revise our assumptions for trend potential GDP growth for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.15,0)">Now these critics have become quiet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.84,0)">Some of them have even gone to the other extreme and, in my view, have now become excessively pessimistic about the prospects for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Recent years have shown that the economic cost of adjusting to a phase of over-optimism is high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.98,0)">We have now seen two years of rather sluggish economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.95,0)">Many of the new businesses set up in the late 1990s no longer exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">But costs have also had to be reduced in other, more traditional sectors and structural adjustments needed to be made to correct the imbalances which arose in the "boom" period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.72,0)">With these structural adjustments or, as Schumpeter put it, "the process of creative destruction", the chances of the phase of low economic growth gradually coming to an end have now increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Indeed, although there are still some downside risks to this scenario, and ongoing balance sheet adjustments make a steep and swift rise in economic activity unlikely, the ECB expects a gradual recovery to occur in the course of this and next year, as imbalances that have built up are gradually unwinding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The ECB will continue to monitor these developments in view of its primary objective, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">to maintain price stability in the euro area.</span>
