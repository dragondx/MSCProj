    <span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)"> Hearing before the Plenary of the European Parliament on the occasion of the adoption of the Resolution on the ECB Annual Report 2011 Introductory statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Strasbourg, 16 April 2013 President, Honourable members of the European Parliament, I am very pleased to take part in this debate today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It forms a central part of the ECB’s accountability towards the European Parliament to which the ECB attaches utmost importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Since 2011 the ECB has taken a number of important measures to address severe distortions in the financial markets and to address fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Although I have had many occasions to discuss the ECB’s policies during my regular hearing before the ECON Committee, today is an opportunity to take a broad view on recent economic developments and monetary policy decisions, as well as to discuss the adjustment in the euro area and the outlook for EMU governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This will allow me to cover several issues highlighted in the draft resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.03,0)">Economic developments and monetary policy decisions Following two years of recovery, the euro area moved into recession in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.12,0)">Unemployment has reached unprecedented levels, especially among young people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.46,0)">This economic weakness was driven by declining private consumption and faltering investment, in an environment of weak business and consumer confidence and financial market tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">We expect a gradual recovery in euro area economic activity for the second half of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.66,0)">But this scenario is subject to downside risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.46,0)">In 2012, headline HICP inflation in the euro area was 2.5%, reflecting elevated energy prices and increases in indirect taxes and administered prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.27,0)">Annual inflation rates have since declined to 1.7% in March this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The Governing Council remains firmly committed to its price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This is fully reflected in long-term inflation expectations which have remained firmly anchored in line with our price stability objective of below but close to 2 %.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">2011 and 2012 were years in which much of our focus was on the proper transmission of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.8,0)">When changes in policy rates are not appropriately transmitted to the real economy, this is a matter of concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In a context of large refinancing needs and persisting funding stress for banks, the ECB launched two long term   refinancing operations in late 2011 and early 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">These operations, in combination with our measures to enhance the availability of collateral, were pivotal in preventing a disorderly process of lenders’ deleveraging and a large-scale credit crunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">This action was instrumental in maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.86,0)">Later in 2012, a renewed confidence crisis, in part reflecting unwarranted investor fears about the reversibility of the euro, caused a severe deterioration in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.83,0)">Sovereign bond and bank lending rates in some countries increased dramatically, thereby impairing access to financing of the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">To safeguard the singleness of monetary policy and to ensure an effective transmission of the ECB’s policy intentions to the broad economy, in August, the Governing Council announced its readiness to undertake Outright Monetary Transactions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">OMTs have proven to be an effective backstop against unfounded fears of reversibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.85,0)">Strict conditionality contains moral hazard on the side of governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">It ensures that they will adopt the reforms that are necessary to secure their solvency and to foster conditions of steady growth for their economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As I said before, the repair of the transmission channel cannot be done by the central bank alone, governments need to do their part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Let me therefore turn to the on-going adjustment in Member States, and the euro area more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The adjustment in the euro area During the past five years, a number of euro area countries have seen a significant correction of their external and domestic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">In Ireland, Greece and Portugal current account balances improved by more than 7 per cent of GDP between 2008 and 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.32,0)">A large part of this adjustment has been driven by a contraction in domestic demand, triggered by the unwinding of long accumulated unsustainable developments and by the cyclical downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">At the same time, in Ireland, Spain and Portugal export performance has been very strong compared with the pre-crisis period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This is a sign that a genuine structural correction is taking place and resources are being moved from the non-tradable sector to the production of traded goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">We have also seen some improvement in cost competitiveness, which has contributed to the external adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.57,0)">Between 2008 and 2012, in the three programme countries the cumulated unit labour cost growth was about 10pp below the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The adjustment has been mainly driven by an increase in average productivity, largely reflecting labour shedding, rather than by a reduction in nominal wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The latter adjustment has been much more limited so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.07,0)">This has contributed to increasing the real cost of adjustment and the burden borne by the more vulnerable members of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">It calls for greater determination in further addressing rigidities in wage setting and increasing competition in many segments of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Reducing rents is not only a matter of efficiency in the adjustment process: it is also a matter of equity in sharing the burden of adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.2,0)">The outlook for EMU Prior to the crisis, Member States did not internalise fully what it means to be part of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.09,0)">Fiscal and economic policies were not sufficiently geared towards the conditions of being a member of a single currency zone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">But the lessons of the crisis have been learnt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">EU Heads of State and Government have taken action and strengthened the governance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The current deepening of EMU is essential, in particular as regards banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">It is of utmost importance that the legislation on the Single Supervision Mechanism   is finalised before the summer break now that a political agreement has been found.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">This is an absolute prerequisite if we want to embark upon our preparatory work in a timely and effective fashion, so that the SSM is operational by mid-2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Equally important is the swift set-up of a Single Resolution Mechanism  : it is a necessary complement to the SSM and a key element of banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The Commission’s intention to put forward a legislative proposal before summer is highly welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">In the meantime, the Directive on Bank Recovery and Resolution will hopefully be adopted and provide for a coherent EU-wide set of rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Deeper economic union means more than fixing the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">We therefore welcome the proposal to conduct ex-ante coordination of structural reforms initiatives, which should be implemented as a best-practice benchmarking exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In the same vein, reform contracts, in which Member States commit to concrete reforms with specific timelines, would also facilitate the recovery of competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">But new rules are only as good as the commitment to actually implement them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">It is of key importance that the existing legislation is applied forcefully during the ongoing European Semester: this represents a true test of the credibility of EMU’s governance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I thank you for your attention and stand at your disposal for questions.</span>
