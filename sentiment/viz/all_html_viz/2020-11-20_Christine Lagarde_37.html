    <h1> Fostering sustainable growth in Europe  </h1>
    <h2> Keynote speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the European Banking Congress </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Christine Lagarde </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)"> Fostering sustainable growth in Europe Keynote speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the European Banking Congress Frankfurt am Main, 20 November 2020 The coronavirus   pandemic has rightly focused minds on the here and now – on saving lives and securing livelihoods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Our immediate priority has been to protect the economy until widespread immunity is achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Yet the pandemic also provides the opportunity to reassess how we will organise our economy in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Today’s conference, on the topic of “Towards a New Sustainable Growth Model”, comes at just the right moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">By necessity, the pandemic has accelerated our wider and more common use of digital technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We have adjusted how we work, how we shop and how we pay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.52,0)">Nearly 50% of Europeans say they have worked from home during the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">E-commerce increased by almost one-fifth during the first lockdown , and it stayed at that level even after restrictions were lifted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.51,0)">We have seen a surge in online payments and a shift towards contactless: about 40% of respondents to a recent survey say they have reduced their use of cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.87,0)">Such shifts are neither unusual nor unwelcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Major technological advances have been recurring features in our history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Two centuries ago, land transport was powered by oats rather than by oil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A century ago, agriculture accounted for almost 60% of employment in Spain, and more than 40% in France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.68,0)">Last year, the share was less than 4% in both countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Faster digitalisation offers many benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">It could lead to a less resource-intensive economy, allowing carbon emissions to be decoupled from economic growth more quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">It could give a jolt to productivity, especially in Europe: consider that IT adoption has been a key factor in the United States exhibiting faster productivity growth than Europe since the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Faster digitalisation could also democratise access to essential services, such as health and education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">In the United States, it is estimated that only 11% of consumers used telemedicine in 2019, but that number has increased to 46% during the pandemic and 76% are interested in using it in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.51,0)">But technological transitions have not always been smooth – and that can be a source of anxiety.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.16,0)">The decline of previously successful industries has sometimes led to high long-term unemployment and regions being scarred for decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Digitalisation will not necessarily reduce, but rather transform jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.49,0)">Research finds that unemployment rates are generally lower in more digitalised economies,  but it does typically lead to jobs being reallocated across industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.89,0)">By one estimate, faster automation as a result of the pandemic will destroy 85 million jobs across 26 countries by 2025, but will also create 97 million new jobs – a net gain of 12 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.12,0)">Europe faces many challenges in the coming years arising from both the pandemic and from long-run trends, including increasing debt levels, demographic ageing, digitalisation and climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Successfully sustaining growth requires progress along a number of dimensions, but in particular it will be vital to harness the opportunities offered by new technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">That means finding new production methods that can create jobs, ensuring every worker has the opportunity to acquire the skills needed to work in those jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In other words, it requires a clear focus on innovation and education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I will concentrate on these two interdependent priorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Innovation Let’s start with innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.25,0)">While we can see the general trends the pandemic has set in motion, we do not know where demand will ultimately come from.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">So we need to create the supply conditions to adjust quickly to the new patterns that will emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This means building an environment that rewards experimentation and innovation and that tolerates failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">In particular, new, innovative firms must be empowered to agilely fill gaps in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.05,0)">Young firms account for around one-fifth of employment, but nearly half of new jobs created.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is not about simply freeing up market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Innovation takes place at the intersection between science, markets and finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">All three must be present for it to prosper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">For example, one factor behind the United States’ success in generating cutting-edge innovation comes from its knowledge hubs, where research labs, universities and investors operate in close proximity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Examples include Silicon Valley and the Boston region, world capital of the biotech industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Many of the high-tech champions of today were started by students who had an idea at university and then started and grew a new company with funding from local venture capitalists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Europe has great potential in this area, as demonstrated by the role of Europe’s innovative pharmaceutical companies in developing a vaccine against COVID-19.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">And we have a lot of scope to go further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">While different governments will naturally have their own goals and strategies, there are three cross-cutting areas where we can make progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">First, if we want new, innovative firms to emerge after the pandemic, governments have to remove barriers for them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">This is not only about easing regulatory barriers, but also about creating a dynamic business environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.36,0)">Research shows that onerous business conditions – such as poor contract enforcement – penalise new firms much more than they do existing ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">And what young firms need is not only the ability to enter easily, but also to grow quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Companies with new ideas need to be able to hire and achieve scale as fast as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The rate of firm creation is actually similar in the United States and Europe, but US firms grow faster.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This is an area where we can make huge gains simply by taking full advantage of our Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">A deep, complete and digital Single Market would allow firms to expand faster and achieve European scale, thereby increasing the return on innovation and capitalising on a large market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Second, for young firms to grow quickly, resources need to flow towards them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And since the new firms that create the most jobs are typically the most risky, access to early-stage financing is particularly important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">So the financial sector has a key role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">In particular, equity finance has been shown to be an important complement to bank finance in allocating resources to new rather than traditional industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This matters when it comes to green innovations in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Recent analysis shows that equity finance helps to reduce an economy’s carbon footprint and to increase the rate of green innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.68,0)">However, while venture capital investment in 2019 reached 0.63% of GDP in the United States, that figure was just 0.05% in the EU27.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Here again, we can achieve clear economies of scale by working together in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.59,0)">One reason that early-stage financing is lower in Europe is that national financial markets are fragmented: funding high-risk, high-reward technologies is much more effective when there is a larger stream of new projects to compensate for the fact that the majority of them will fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the post-pandemic world, completing the capital markets union is therefore no longer a “nice-to-have”, it is a “must have”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Third, the public sector itself has a role to play in creating demand for innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Governments can help scientific ideas become commercial reality by linking research and teaching more closely in our innovation ecosystems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Publicly funded incubator programmes can also help to nurture disruptive, early-stage ideas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">One study finds that a 10% increase in government-financed R&D generates a 5% to 6% increase in privately funded R&D.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Europe can support this process too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">20% of spending by the Next Generation EU fund will be spent on digital projects and at least 30% on green projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">And European entities like the European Investment Bank are now fully focused on accelerating clean energy innovation and adoption of renewables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Education Yet even if enough new jobs are created in the post-pandemic economy, they may not be equally accessible to everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.36,0)">The rapid digitalisation of the economy risks causing a decline in equality of opportunity, especially since those in “teleworkable” jobs tend to be more highly skilled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.12,0)">In the first half of 2020, the labour force contracted by almost 7% for people with low skills and 5.4% for those with medium skills, but it actually grew, by 3.3%, for those with high skills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And this brings me to the second area: education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.56,0)">While the pandemic has opened up new opportunities for online learning, we have also seen that these opportunities have been challenging to implement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.55,0)">Schools and universities have faced significant disruption over the course of this year, and there is a risk that the negative effects of this disruption could linger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.06,0)">Research indicates that the long-term socioeconomic status of children born during pandemics can be negatively affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.52,0)">The crisis has also hit young workers disproportionately hard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.08,0)">In the first half of this year, employment for 15 to 24-year-olds dropped by almost 5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.02,0)">That also affects long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Young people have the greatest digital know-how and therefore the greatest potential to push digitalisation forwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">So how can we equip people with the skills they need in the post-pandemic economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Clearly, investing in Europe’s educational structure is vital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Only two euro area countries are ranked in the top ten for mathematics and science in the most recent PISA exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The highest-ranked EU university in the latest QS world rankings is in 50th place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">At the same time, the key near-term challenge is likely to be the re-skilling and upskilling of the existing workforce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Here, technological advances should help.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Modern online learning includes massive open online courses, fully online master’s degrees and other online material accompanied by classroom interaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Greater use of digital technology makes it easier to better match jobs with skills across Europe – especially in the face of limited labour mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.37,0)">Factors that hinder labour mobility in Europe include strong cultural attachments and language barriers – only half of Europeans are able to hold a conversation in a language other than their mother tongue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">But automatic translation has improved substantially due to artificial intelligence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The experience of the pandemic has also demonstrated people’s ability to work remotely across different European economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This could support the virtual mobility of workers across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Of course, these same forces could also accelerate the outsourcing of service-based jobs to the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This is why we have to seize the opportunity and invest in education and training now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Even if innovation and education can raise long-term growth, we are likely to face increasing volatility around that growth path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.82,0)">Disruptive technological change and the transition to a carbon-neutral economy will accelerate structural shifts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Our societies and economies will need to adapt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This brings me to my conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.58,0)">Conclusion Policymakers have rightly focused on the short-term disruption caused by the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">They have acted swiftly and effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Yet the pandemic has exposed and accelerated longer-term trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">These trends could generate significant benefits but also disruption during the transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">There are important debates to be had about what growth should look like in the 21st century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">But in all cases, sustaining growth requires harnessing the possibilities new technologies offer our workers and businesses in the most inclusive possible way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">And it involves making sure we are able to adapt to new environments created by the unpredictable shocks we will face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">To meet these goals, decisive policy actions are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.97,0)">Those policies lie beyond the remit of monetary policy, but will certainly affect the environment in which central banks operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">I am confident that European policymakers will find the right way forwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">As Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote, the “task is not to foresee the future, but to enable it.”  Lagarde, C.  , “Monetary policy in a
