    <span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)"> Economic Heterogeneity, Convergence and Monetary Policy in an Enlarged Euro Area Lucas Papademos, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, speech delivered at the 7th Biennial Athenian Policy Forum conference “Asymmetries in Trade and Currency Arrangements in the 21st Century”, jointly organised by the University of Giessen, the Athenian Policy Forum and the Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt am Main, 29 July 2004 Introduction This important conference focuses on a fascinating topic: “Asymmetries in Trade and Currency Arrangements in the 21st century.” I have been invited to share with you some thoughts on monetary policy in an enlarged European Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There is one presumption and at least one expectation underlying this invitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.57,0)">The presumption is that the European monetary union is characterized by significant “asymmetries” and that the single monetary policy has “asymmetric” effects on the national economies of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The expectation is that these asymmetries are likely to increase when more countries join the euro area in the future and, consequently, European policy-makers are likely to face greater challenges in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I will examine to what extent the presumption is correct and whether or to what extent the expectation is going to prove accurate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I will also discuss their implications for the single monetary policy and for the national economic policies of the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.7,0)">The enlargement of the European Union   by the ten new Member States on 1 May 2004 was a historic event with far-reaching consequences for the size and diversity of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Enlargement has created the world’s biggest unified market that accounts for about one fourth of world trade and global gross domestic product  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In terms of population size, the EU comes third after China and India.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">With a total of twenty-five Member States, the Union has also become more heterogeneous, not only because of the increased variety of languages and cultural traditions but also because of the greater differences between its members in terms of economic and financial structures as well as living standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.83,0)">The existence of regional economic differences or asymmetries is not uncommon in economic and monetary unions, including those that were established a long time ago, such as the United States of America.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Macroeconomic policies, monetary policy in particular, have been conducted effectively in such unions over a very long period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.3,0)">Nevertheless, policy-makers may face challenges depending on the extent of differences in economic and financial structures as well as on the de facto degree of market integration and factor mobility in a large and heterogeneous economic and monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In my presentation, I will first examine the extent of convergence in the euro area today as reflected in the inflation and output growth differentials between Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I will assess in particular the magnitude, causes and persistence of these differentials and consider the implications for the single monetary policy and the national economic policies of euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Secondly, I will review how the Union’s enlargement has affected the heterogeneity of its economy as shown by several indicators and draw some conclusions on the likelihood that differences in output and inflation dynamics will persist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Finally, I will discuss the expected consequences of the future expansion of the euro area for the conduct and orientation of the single monetary policy, the governance of the Eurosystem, and for the role of national economic policies in enhancing the overall economic performance of the enlarged euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.59,0)">The state of convergence in the euro area: facts and policy implications Convergence, in a broad sense, can be defined as a process in which differences in economic and financial structures across countries diminish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.96,0)">Differences in the structure and functioning of markets, notably of labor and financial markets, as well as differences in fiscal structures and positions across countries can influence significantly economic dynamics as they have a bearing on the way shocks and the effects of monetary policy are transmitted through the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.91,0)">Such structural and fiscal divergences manifest themselves in different output growth and inflation rates across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.09,0)">Some degree of heterogeneity has to be considered a natural feature of any monetary union, an integral part of the adjustment mechanism resulting from differing positions in terms of GDP per capita, varied structural features including market adjustment mechanisms, and the effects of asymmetric demand and supply shocks impinging on national economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.51,0)">While some of these differences reflect given “initial positions” and desirable internal equilibrating processes, others are caused by structural rigidities or the stance of national fiscal policies and they should therefore be tackled by pursuing appropriate policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It is useful to start by briefly examining the extent of convergence   in the euro area, as reflected in inflation and output growth differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.71,0)">Obviously, aggregate data for the euro area mask differences across the various countries in the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">These differences, however, do not seem to be extremely large either from a historical perspective or in comparison with the experience of other currency unions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.28,0)">The degree of dispersion of output growth across euro area countries in the second half of the 1990s was comparable to that in the previous two decades  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The dispersion of inflation rates is historically low and it is comparable with the one observed in other well-established currency unions, such as the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">There are signs that the adoption of the single monetary policy has contributed to the cyclical synchronization of growth rates in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Most visibly, with the establishment of monetary union, not only have we moved to a single short-term interest rate but also long-term interest rates are very closely aligned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Underlying the latter development is a convergence of national long-term inflation expectations across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.9,0)">Inflation dispersion reached its lowest level in 1999, with the inception of Stage Three of EMU and, since then, it has remained broadly unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.37,0)">In particular, the unweighted standard deviation of inflation rates across euro area countries has remained close to one percentage point since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">A closer assessment of the extent of inflation differentials across euro area countries at present can be made against some appropriate benchmarks or references.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">A comparison with metropolitan areas within the United States may provide useful insights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.68,0)">The comparison with other monetary unions, however, is always subject to some caveats and limitations, mostly due to the lack of fully comparable data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Bearing this in mind, the size of inflation differentials across euro area countries since the establishment of EMU has not been very different from that observed in the United States  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It is worth noting, however, that, in contrast to the inflation differentials between regions of the United States, most countries within the euro area have witnessed relatively persistent inflation differentials in recent years.1 To illustrate this point, and focusing on the period since 1999, several euro area countries have witnessed inflation differentials exceeding one percentage point for at least two consecutive years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This has not been the case in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The persistence of inflation differentials therefore seems to be a specific feature of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.04,0)">What are the underlying causes of the inflation differentials observed in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It appears that differences in economic growth and cyclical positions, while undoubtedly relevant, would not suffice to explain the size and persistence of inflation differentials in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Current inflation differentials can be better explained by a combination of special and structural factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.2,0)">As to the special factors, which can be characterized as temporary, changes in administered prices and indirect taxes across euro area countries have differed significantly and have thus contributed to the observed inflation differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.61,0)">As regards structural factors that can have long-lasting effects, inflation differentials in some countries have been partly caused by price level and real income convergence, often associated with Balassa-Samuelson effects.2 It is not easy to estimate the size of catching-up effects and to isolate them from the influences of other factors on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.29,0)">In any event, as the process of convergence is progressing among euro area countries, it should gradually lead to a decline in the inflation dispersion caused by price level and income convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.71,0)">Other structural factors, such as the degree of wage and price rigidities or the degree of competition in key domestic markets, have also partly contributed to the observed inflation differentials and their persistence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.23,0)">So what are the policy implications of inflation differentials in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The single monetary policy of the ECB can only be geared towards the objective of price stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.07,0)">Just as in any monetary union, inflation differentials in the euro area reflect different regional price dynamics and adjustments in relative prices and in national price levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.43,0)">These factors cannot be addressed by the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Nevertheless, to the extent that price formation processes diverge across countries, it is useful for monetary policy to take into account the size, persistence and determinants of inflation differentials in assessing area-wide inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In this respect, the ECB’s explicit aim of maintaining euro area inflation below but close to 2 percent over the medium-term is regarded as sufficient to address concerns that some countries would record, on a structural basis, too low inflation rates in a monetary union.3 In assessing the relevance of inflation differentials to the national economic policies of euro area countries, we should first stress that, from a national perspective, the single European monetary policy stance is something given.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.97,0)">Whether a national policy response to an inflation differential is needed depends on its cause and persistence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">An inflation differential related to the catching-up process does not necessarily call for a policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In fact, inflation differentials among countries with different trend growth rates bring about the adjustment of relative price levels that accompanies the catching-up process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Such differentials can be regarded as a means of adjustment and do not call for policy responses as long as convergence in price and wage levels does not outpace convergence in productivity levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.97,0)">If, on the other hand, positive inflation differentials are associated with loose fiscal policies or wage increases in excess of productivity advances, they could undermine the competitive position of the country concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Such differentials, therefore, do require national policy responses that bring about adjustments in the form of below-area average inflation for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.5,0)">Such an adjustment process can be painful as it may entail sizeable growth and welfare losses over a period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Well-designed structural reforms, particularly measures aimed at removing nominal rigidities and leading to a more responsive wage- and price-setting process in the wake of changing economic circumstances, can facilitate and speed up wage and price adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.71,0)">EU enlargement, economic heterogeneity and convergence Looking ahead, what impact would future enlargements of the euro area have on inflation and growth differentials?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In answering this question, we should first briefly point to the relevant institutional framework in order to provide the proper perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The process of European monetary integration is characterized by a very well-defined multilateral institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This means that, at every stage of the monetary integration process, major policy decisions concerning one country or currency are collectively made by all EU Member States or by the euro area countries, the European Commission and the ECB Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">The institutional framework aims to guarantee that monetary integration takes place in an appropriate fashion and with the right accompanying policies in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The road to the adoption of the euro is a process comprising a number of phases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The first phase for a new Member State is the period after EU accession and before joining the exchange rate mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The second phase starts with entry into ERM II and stretches all the way to euro adoption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">On the path to the euro – and to sustainable convergence – the period of ERM II membership is a crucial one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Some countries have already entered this phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Following the mutual agreement between participant parties, three new Member States, namely Estonia, Lithuania and Slovenia joined ERM II on 27 June 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">More countries are likely to follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There is no predetermined timing and there are no
