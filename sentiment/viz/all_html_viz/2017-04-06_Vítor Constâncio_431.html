    <span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)"> Effectiveness of Monetary Union and the Capital Markets Union Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the EUROFI Conference, Malta, 6 April 2017 Introduction In my remarks today I will link the role of monetary policy with the project of the Capital Markets Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Monetary policy has played a vital role in bolstering euro area resilience to the large shocks that have occurred over the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Indeed, it is the only expansionary macroeconomic policy in support of the resilient recovery now underway in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Nevertheless, we have not yet completed the task of attaining our goal of a sustained path of inflation close to but below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">But while monetary policy has been successful at sustaining the area-wide recovery, it is unable to significantly counteract the effects on individual countries from asymmetric shocks, which have been substantial in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">There is an important role here for capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">By permitting households and businesses to draw on cross-border income streams and lending, deeper financial integration reduces the impact of asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.39,0)">The degree of financial integration in the euro area is currently insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.93,0)">Indeed, in the recent crisis, the degree of financial integration fell, as interbank markets fragmented along national lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.0,0)">This fragmentation exacerbated the overall impact of the shocks on the euro area, deepening the recession, lengthening the recovery and increasing the need for unconventional monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The single currency area provides fertile conditions for deeper financial integration and that deeper integration in turn helps build resilience to shocks and strengthens the effectiveness of monetary policy by means of a more homogenous transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Monetary policy and CMU are thus linked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Let me start by discussing the current situation and the contribution of monetary policy in sustaining the current recovery before returning to discussing how CMU can help generate greater resilience to future shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The current economic conjuncture The euro area recovery is gaining momentum, broadening across sectors and countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.37,0)">This is evidenced by 15 consecutive quarters of positive real GDP growth, unemployment at its lowest level since 2009 and over four and a half million more people employed now than was the case three years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Growth in manufacturing also reached its highest rate since 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Moreover, the current recovery has shown considerable resilience amid an environment of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.44,0)">Typically, euro area activity closely co-moves with world trade, so if the latter slows this acts as a headwind for growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">However, the strength of domestic demand has enabled euro area growth to continue to expand, despite the marked slowdown in global trade  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.62,0)">These measures have had a considerable impact on euro area financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.81,0)">Bank lending rates for both firms and households are currently at historical lows, and lending volumes experiencing an upward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Borrowing costs in vulnerable countries have been significantly reduced, reducing fragmentation and small and medium sized enterprises are especially benefitting from the increasing pass-through of policy rates to lending rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In this regard, monetary policy has had some success in mitigating the asymmetric impact of shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">To give an example of the contribution of monetary policy to this easing in financing conditions, ECB staff estimate that lending rates to non-financial firms would be about 70 basis points higher absent our policies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.64,0)">In combination with other factors, lending rates to non-financial firms dropped by 120bp from June 2014 to date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Global growth prospects are showing signs of strengthening and may well further support the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Indeed, despite the waning support from oil prices, growth has continued to broaden and gain momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.55,0)">While risks to the outlook remain on the downside, they are less pronounced than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Our latest staff macroeconomic projections were revised slightly upwards, with annual real GDP is expected to increase by 1.8% in 2017, 1.7% in 2018 and 1.6% in 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The impact of monetary policy measures on euro area GDP growth is sizeable, adding a cumulative 1.7% over the period 2016-2019  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The increase mostly reflects rising energy and food price inflation, with underlying inflation pressures still subdued  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.06,0)">The flash estimate for March shows that headline inflation has dropped to 1.5% from 2% in February and that underlying inflation decreased from 0.9% to 0.7%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.24,0)">We had previously warned that headline inflation could decline after March-April as a result of the reduced statistical base effect of comparing this year’s price levels of oil and other commodities with their value a year ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.79,0)">The decrease in underlying inflation, however, is disappointing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.4,0)">The domestic drivers of inflation, namely wages, are not yet responding to the recovery and the narrowing output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">According to our latest projections, inflation is expected to move towards 1.7% in 2019  , predicated on underlying inflation and wage growth of 1.8% and 2.4%, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Without the foreseen increase in wages, the baseline scenario of our staff projections for growth and inflation will not materialise in 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.79,0)">At early stages of its recovery, the US also faced the same subdued behaviour of underlying inflation and wages that accelerated only later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">To achieve our goals concerning self-sustained inflation, we have to be sure that domestic drivers of inflation are behaving accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">In this perspective, it is worth mentioning that the projections rely on the continued substantial degree of monetary accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.52,0)">Absent our policy package, inflation would on average be almost 0.5% lower than currently projected in each year over 2016-2019  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.6,0)">In other words, inflation is not yet self-sustaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">For this reason, the Governing Council at its last meeting confirmed the appropriateness of the current monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">As ever, we are data dependent; we recognise that there has been improvement in the situation and if inflation gives signs of a sustained path towards our aims, we will reassess our present policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">But that is not to say that monetary policy has been successful in completely eliminating the effects of those shocks on individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.15,0)">That is beyond the ability of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">What other options are there, then, to build resilience in the euro area against future shocks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">First, it is worth noting the absence of other macroeconomic policies in sustaining the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.72,0)">There has been little support from fiscal policy, and the progress on structural reforms has not been completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">We have frequently discussed how a greater counter-cyclical role for fiscal policy and more flexible economies can help reduce the impact of shocks and buttress the efforts of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Those views remain true today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">But there is a role, too, for deeper financial integration through the CMU to build resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Well-functioning political, economic, and monetary unions are normally characterised by high levels of risk-sharing across regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">For example, evidence suggests that three quarters of shocks to the per-capita gross product of individual states in the United States are smoothed, and that capital markets and credit markets together account for around two-thirds of that smoothing, dwarfing the contribution from federal transfers  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.46,0)">Similarly, in post-unification Germany around 69% of region-specific shocks to GDP growth are smoothed through capital markets and credit markets, and only about 11% through fiscal tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.88,0)">In comparison, the overall contribution of markets to risk sharing in the euro area has, on average, been limited  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">At present, little more than 20% of the idiosyncratic shocks to a country’s economy are smoothed, with changes in relative prices contributing the most to risk sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.08,0)">e., the part of a shock to country-specific GDP growth that is reflected into country-specific consumption growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.82,0)">Contributions sum up to 100 percent, and a negative contribution corresponds to dis-smoothing of consumption growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The respective contributions are estimated over rolling ten-year backward-looking windows, based on annual data and applying the Asdrubali and Kim   approach enhanced for relative price adjustments in the spirit of Corsetti, Dedola, and Viani  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Risk-sharing via cross-border ownership of assets increased substantially following the introduction of the euro, smoothing between 30% and 40% of country-specific shocks to GDP by the mid-2000s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.37,0)">But the contribution of capital markets declined substantially during the financial and especially during the sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.75,0)">The contribution of credit markets has been lower, and it even became negative during the financial crisis when European banking sector was particularly hit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">In the absence of a European supra-national system of taxes and transfers, it is more pressing than ever to boost Europe’s risk-sharing potential through financial market mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The risk-sharing benefits of integrated financial markets could in principle be large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Another major benefit of the CMU is the contribution to convergent growth among member countries, resulting from the improved circulation and allocation of savings across the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">In this perspective, Brexit makes it more crucial that the CMU is effectively implemented and that European growth can avail itself of the services of an integrated financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This is particularly true of a CMU focused on stimulating equity financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Indeed, equity and foreign direct investment  , and longer-maturity debt in general, are leading to a more resilient form of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Deeper equity markets constitute an unquestionable advantage to the US, notably in relation to the role of venture capital in promoting innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">For the expansion of such an activity it is important to create a deep equity market that can provide significant returns in successful IPOs   that can offset losses incurred by failing risky projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The CMU is aimed at completing the single market for capital by building integrated markets for equity and bond finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This should be achieved through both regulatory and non-regulatory actions, including the harmonisation of key legislation and policies related to financial products, such as investor protection and bankruptcy procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">A number of concrete measures are set out in the Commission’s Action Plan to underpin the further development of large capital markets in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The same applies to improving financial literacy and to stimulating a shift in household savings from bank deposits to equity holdings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">We need a CMU that is ambitious; it should come with a roadmap in terms of goals and milestones to be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Broad objectives such as deepening financial integration and achieving risk sharing should be matched with specific proposals such as facilitating funding for corporates in general and for SMEs in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Key areas such as securitisation, insolvency regimes, and tax legislation need to be prioritised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Cross-border barriers to clearing and settlement should be removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Financial stability concerns also need to be addressed, including an assessment of whether additional macro-prudential instruments should be developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The proper regulation of financial products and supervision of financial entities, such as insurers and pension funds, as well as full transparency of new financial products, should be put in place as they are essential to convincing households to switch to more market-based forms of saving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In this respect, enhanced powers for the European Securities Markets Authority   and better coordination with the national competent authorities will help strengthen the implementation and enforcement of rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Conclusion Allow me to conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The euro area is experiencing a resilient recovery, sustained by monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Outturns for high-frequency data so far this year point to continued momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">But it is too soon to declare complete success: we have yet to secure a sustained convergence in inflation towards our goal of close to but below 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">With the recovery underway, we should aim to build euro area resilience to future shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">In this regard, clear progress on CMU will help put in place the right conditions to encourage a greater degree of financial integration in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">This in turn will help dampen the asymmetric effects of future shocks, bolster the effectiveness of monetary policy and enhance the welfare of our citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Asdrubali, P., Sorensen, B. and Yosha, O., “Channels of interstate risk sharing: United States 1963-1990”, Quarterly
