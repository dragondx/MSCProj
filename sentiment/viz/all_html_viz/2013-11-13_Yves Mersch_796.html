    <span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)"> SMEs, Banking Union, and securitisation – exploring the nexus Keynote speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,EIB, in cooperation with RBWC and the EURO 50 Group: “Investment and Investment Finance: Putting Europe on a sustainable growth path”, Luxembourg, 13 November 2013 President Hoyer, SMEs are the pillars of the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">99.7% of the firms in the EU are SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.14,0)">The vast majority of those are micro firms with less than 9 employees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">They are also the major drivers of job and wealth creation: the European Commission estimated in 2012 that SMEs employed nearly 70% of EU workers and contributed around 60% of value added.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In other words, the health of smaller businesses and the health of the EU economy are thoroughly intertwined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Europe should therefore be very concerned by the difficulties that SMEs are currently facing – in particular those in countries under stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.98,0)">Of course, we cannot avoid that certain business models become outmoded and disappear during downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.77,0)">This is the nature of the market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.69,0)">But the situation facing SMEs in certain jurisdictions goes beyond that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.03,0)">Firms have been forced to close not only because business models were flawed, but because they were located in the wrong place and could not get access to finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.14,0)">Two major challenges lie in front of us: Continental Europe remains a bank-based economy, and small businesses mostly depend on banks to finance themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is therefore our responsibility to make sure that banks do not find undue impediments to lend to sound borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">At the same time, we should promote other forms of financing to complement the banking channel with non-bank sources of finance through strengthening capital markets and in particular securitisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me begin my discussion on how to achieve this by briefly reviewing the structure of financial intermediation in the euro area and how it is affecting SMEs today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Financial intermediation and SMEs In the euro area, banks have historically played an important role in financing the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Banks loans account for around 50% of firms’ external financing, which is very different from the US where around 80% of firms’ financing comes from capital markets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">The importance of bank-based intermediation in the euro area explains the relatively large size of the euro area banking sector compared with the US – at 270% and 72% of GDP, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.09,0)">However, the crisis has hampered bank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.45,0)">Indeed, loans to the private sector have fallen for 16 straight months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.09,0)">On the supply side, heightened funding costs and persistent financial fragmentation in the euro area constrain new credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">This is in part due to the necessary process of consolidation and deleveraging in the euro area banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.61,0)">The sector has decreased in size by about 30 percentage points of GDP since 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.98,0)">But it also reflects, on the demand side, the weak economic environment, the need to repair private balance sheets and heightened uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The effects of these constraints are not being felt evenly across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.91,0)">First, there is considerable heterogeneity in firms’ access to bank finance, in particular SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.19,0)">In the last ECB survey on SMEs access to finance obstacles were reported to be very high in Greece, Ireland and Spain  , more moderate in Belgium, France and Finland  , and lowest in Germany and Austria  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.19,0)">Second, as regards non-bank financing, access has largely been limited to larger firms and those located in countries with more developed corporate bond markets, such as Germany and France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Our data shows that these firms have been able to partly offset reduced access to bank finance with bond issuance in the last 12 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.41,0)">But such substitution has not been possible for most SMEs, and for firms located in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.85,0)">There are more than just stigma effects at play here: SMEs are intrinsically highly-dependent on banks for financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.69,0)">This is because it is often difficult and costly for non-bank financers to get enough information to make informed investment decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In addition, SMEs, by virtue of their size and activities, are often more prone to fall into bankruptcy; from a lender’s perspective diversifying this credit risk to an acceptable degree requires issuing many SME loans—a role more suited for banks for the time being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.17,0)">So all in all, SMEs remain very dependent on bank financing, while access to that financing is decreasing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.4,0)">This creates a major barrier to SMEs’ investment and growth opportunities – and given their importance to the economy, to euro area growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Ensuring access to finance for SMEs must therefore be a central tenet of achieving a sustainable recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Some measures have already been taken to support SME financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">In July this year the Eurosystem recognised the lower risks posed by securities backed by SME loans, taking into account the introduction of the ECB loan level data transparency initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.66,0)">In the context of the regular review of its collateral risk control framework, the Eurosystem accordingly reduced haircuts on SME ABSs posted as collateral for its regular monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Elsewhere, a number of public initiatives have also been launched at both the national and European levels to ease the credit constraints of SMEs, for instance through use of public guarantees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.03,0)">Even though at this stage of the recovery the supply-side is not the major cause of the continued weak lending data but the weak demand, nevertheless, two key priorities ought to be addressed on the supply-side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The first priority is to support the bank lending channel by strengthening banks – that is, by cleaning up their balance sheets and reducing fragmentation in funding markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">I am confident that banking union will help achieve this, not least through its comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The second priority is to support the bank lending channel by strengthening capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">As disintermediation is not an option for most euro area SMEs, a promising middle way is to increase possibilities for the securitisation of SME loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">This could build a bridge between SMEs and non-bank sources of finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me address each in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Strengthening banks: the role of banking union The euro area economy is slowly beginning to improve, indeed the latest Commission forecasts project 1.1% growth for next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In turn, the demand-side constraints on bank lending should gradually lessen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.31,0)">But at this point, supply-side obstacles could become more of a hindrance, because the recovery will lose momentum if banks cannot fund it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">A key objective of banking union must therefore be to remove those supply-side obstacles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.16,0)">There are currently three main obstacles here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.82,0)">The first is a rising number of non -performing loans on banks’ balance sheets and their slow resolution in several countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">This causes banks to preserve capital and avoid risky new exposures, such as those to SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.96,0)">The second obstacle, which is related, is low investor confidence in banks’ asset quality and provisioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.79,0)">This lack of confidence raises funding costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">This then contributes to higher lending rates for borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.71,0)">The third obstacle is the absence of a unified framework for restructuring banks, leading to uncertainty and fears of a feedback loop between bank and sovereign weakness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">How can banking union help?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.53,0)">To begin with, the forthcoming ECB assessment of banks’ balance sheets has the potential to be a game-changer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">By shedding greater light into the euro area banking sector, this review will help remove the uncertainty about asset valuation and funding models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.48,0)">This is currently distorting the price of funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Moreover, the review will accelerate any necessary loss recognition and corrective actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Improving the viability of banks in this way should help ensure there is enough aggregate balance sheet capacity in the euro area to extend new loans to SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">A rigorous and credible exercise is essential to achieve these effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">That is why we have designed it as both a point-in-time risk-based asset quality review and a forward-looking stress test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">And this is also why we are putting in place a strong central governance structure that ensures the results are fully comparable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">National supervisors and the private firms involved in the assessment operate within the terms of a detailed framework defined by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Their final output will be subject to a central review to guarantee consistency across banks and countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The exercise will capture around 85% of euro area banking assets and hence most real economy exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">But I also expect it to have an effect on the smaller banks outside the exercise whose major business is lending to SMEs, in particular micro firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The assessment will require us to adopt more harmonised definitions of non-performing exposures and forbearance, which will later be applied across the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.91,0)">In several countries this will lead to stricter loss recognition for smaller banks than at present – and so accelerate the process of balance sheet repair even for the banks we do not directly supervise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Looking further ahead, a second channel through which banking union should help support lending to SMEs is reducing financial fragmentation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Both the Single Supervisory Mechanism   and the Single Resolution Mechanism   will help here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">First, the SSM should help lessen fragmentation caused by perceived differences in the quality of supervision between euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.0,0)">We have witnessed the role that this can play in a number of stressed economies in the last few years, where differences in definitions of items such as non-performing exposures led to uncertainty and heightened risk aversion among depositors and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The SSM should also lead to less supervisory ring-fencing of liquidity both between banks and within cross-border banking groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.5,0)">The fact that at present liquidity surpluses in some countries cannot be used to fund needs in others creates fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.67,0)">This structural disconnect means there is greater divergence in bank funding costs and lending rates than is warranted by the underlying economic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Second, an effective SRM should help reduce financial fragmentation linked to the differing fiscal health of sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This mechanism will ensure that there is a clear cascade of bail-in-able liabilities for failing banks and that any discretion in the rules is applied evenly across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Hence, the funding costs of banks should better reflect their idiosyncratic risk, not the credit risk attached to their sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Strengthening capital markets: the role of securitisation However, it will clearly take some time for these measures to repair the bank lending channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">At the same time, it is unrealistic to expect that SMEs can widely borrow from non-bank investors, at least in the short-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">This is why I see strengthening capital markets through securitisation as an important complement to bank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It bridges the financing needs of SMEs with the funds of non-bank investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It also gives those investors access to relatively inaccessible sectors of the economy with the risk and maturity profile that suits them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Indeed, the rich potential of ABSs for customisation allows a precise matching of liabilities—an increasingly important issue in particular for life insurers and pension funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The sums involved are not trivial: at the end of June 2013 insurers, occupational pension funds, money market funds and investment funds together had assets worth almost 16 trillion euros – that is only a trillion euros less than the sum of euro bank deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Of course, only a small fraction of these funds could be expected to be allocated towards securitisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Yet, if more were tapped successfully they could provide an important boost to SME financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.83,0)">The problem at present is that the ABS market in Europe is weak: investor-placed issuance remains far below the pre-crisis levels and secondary market activity is thin in many segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">If we are to reap the potential gains of securitisation for SMEs, we need to revive this market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This implies removing some key impediments to its functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.9,0)">A first impediment is misperceptions about ABSs in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.08,0)">Certainly, ABSs are complex products, involving many entities, legal frameworks and information asymmetries, which can make it difficult for investors to accurately assess the risks involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.99,0)">We have also seen that they can create moral hazard in lending activity, for example the ‘originate to distribute’ model in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.61,0)">And of course, the asset class was one of the triggers of the financial turmoil that began in the US in 2007-08.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.15,0)">There, as summarised by Brunnermeier   and others  , the rise in poorly-understood and improperly-structured securitised products led to a sharp inflow of funding, fuelling a credit bubble amid a reduction in lending standards, and in turn further poor-quality securitisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.91,0)">However, we should not over-react: misuse of mortgage-based ABSs in the US for example does not mean that all such products are inherently dangerous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.64,0)">Indeed, in the EU securitised products by and large far outperformed their US counterparts: by one estimate the default rate of ABSs in the EU was just 1.4% from mid-2007 to the first quarter of 2013, compared 17.4% in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.79,0)">For senior tranches of European SME ABS, there have been no defaults.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Moreover, the US experience has provided us with important lessons about how to make ABS safer also on this side of the pond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Regulations have been put in place in the EU to ensure that originators retain an economic interest in the performance of the underlying loans and that investors carry out proper due diligence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Significant improvements in transparency have also been achieved thanks to the ECB’s loan-level transparency requirements, which cover nearly all euro area cash ABSs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">These changes could go a long way towards reviving investor trust in ABSs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.68,0)">Unfortunately, there is also a second impediment: the potentially uneven and disproportionate treatment of ABS in forthcoming regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Let me specifically point to two measures which arguably may have the most influence on the future of the ABS market: the revisions to the Basel securitisation capital framework for banks and the Solvency II regime for insurers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The Basel III proposals announced at the end of last year would lead to sharp increases in capital requirements for securitisation exposures, particularly for senior high-quality tranches, despite the lack of EU default evidence to support such large changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.63,0)">All ABS were perceived as too risky due to the US experience in the subprime mortgage markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But this regulation is like calibrating the price of flood insurance on the experience of New Orleans for a city like Madrid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Similarly, if adopted the Solvency II framework would prescribe capital charges for insurers of 80% for ABSs with a AA-rating and 42% with a AAA-rating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">By contrast, the charges for corporate bonds would be 6% and 5%, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There is little doubt that these regulations would strongly impact the future decisions of banks and insurers to invest in securitised products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">In my view, greater coordination on the political and technical level is necessary to ensure that these regulations treat ABSs in a fair manner and do not lead to overshooting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.42,0)">Regulators need to base their calibrations on data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.08,0)">But unfortunately, there is no single database with high quality and comprehensive data on the global ABS market’s historical performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.06,0)">Obtaining information on ABS market prices is also challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.7,0)">Regulators often have to make do with partial and incomplete data, leading to many conservative assumptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Therefore, a key ‘quick-win’ here would be to build a common evidence base to ensure that the various initiatives are based on a consistent set of price, performance and liquidity data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Such a database could help ensure that regulations reflect the real risks of ABSs, taking into account the full set of information available on ABS performance across jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">A second European ‘quick-win’ could be reaching a regulatory agreement to define principles for high quality ABSs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As I mentioned above, ABSs are relatively complex instruments, and regulators must currently handle a very heterogeneous ABS market, containing – on the one hand - highly granular asset classes such as credit cards, residential mortgages and – on the other hand – large and highly concentrated corporate exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There are also a number of structures out there, with different ways of transferring credit risk, and heterogeneous priorities for payments for investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.57,0)">A one-size fits all regulatory approach therefore does not work for the ABS market at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">That is why I believe the job of regulators could be made easier if a certain degree of standardisation was explored, identifying high quality ABS from other types of ABS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This would also provide greater confidence for market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The ECB through its collateral eligibility criteria for monetary policy operations has been defining standards for adequate ABS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">These requirements could serve as a starting point for such discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Both these measures would help ensure that regulation that is designed to protect the real economy does not end up suffocating it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.7,0)">The impact of regulations is further aggravated by their reference to external credit ratings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.8,0)">Structured finance ratings in Europe have been very much negatively affected by the application of 'sovereign ceilings'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.15,0)">This practice leads to a situation where any sovereign rating downgrade often leads to at least a one-for-one reduction in the ratings of ABS in those markets, which in turn increases capital charges for investors and reduces the information content of ratings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I find it questionable that, the state of a sovereign, with its own idiosyncratic machinery, continues to dictate conditions for highly-rated ABSs tranches although their structure, composition, and enhancements have carried extremely low default risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.98,0)">Thus it appears that, in many cases, the “low” ratings of the ABS cannot be based on an empirical justification, but reflect an arbitrary view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">On a separate note, let me finally add that I fully support the initiatives being undertaken by the European Commission and European Investment Bank to stimulate both further securitisation activity and SME lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">These measures should provide a boost to both ABS markets and stressed economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.69,0)">We see that the bank lending channel for many small businesses continues to be impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.51,0)">Yet, the euro area recovery cannot be sustained without well-financed SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In my view therefore, there are few greater priorities than implementing the measures I have discussed above.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">First, deepening our capital markets and, second, building a genuine banking union would not only serve SMEs today, but also make our economy more resilient to “the next crisis”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Of course, both goals will take time to achieve, but it is imperative that we strive towards them as soon as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">My vision for the euro area is that a healthy firm that cannot borrow from a bank in its own country should be able to borrow from one elsewhere – and on similar terms to firms from that country, but therefore also banks need to have access to the necessary information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is what it means to share a single currency within a single financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Brunnermeier, M.  , “Deciphering the Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007-2008”, Journal of
