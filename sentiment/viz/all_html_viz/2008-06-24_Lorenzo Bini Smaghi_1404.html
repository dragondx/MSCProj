    <span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)"> Public Hearing on EMU@10: The first ten years of Economic and Monetary Union and future challenges - Introductory comments Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBBrussels, 24 June 2008 Madam Chair, dear Members of the ECON Committee, it is a pleasure to be here today and to share with you my assessment of the challenges facing Economic and Monetary Union in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In order to do that, I believe that there are a series of clarifications to be made, starting with an assessment of the past ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.98,0)">In any balance sheet there are assets and liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The last ten years are full of assets, in many respects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">One is the euro, and the creation of an area of monetary stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Very few believed ten years ago that this could be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">I would like to quote Alan Greenspan, who in his recent book stated “ We have in front of us a historically unique institution, an independent central bank with the exclusive mandate to maintain price stability in an economic area producing over a quarter of the world GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">It’s an extraordinary result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">I can’t stop my admiration for what my European colleagues have been able to achieve”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.69,0)">Let’s consider the negatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.07,0)">What are the liabilities of the last ten years?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.02,0)">Some will claim that growth has been unsatisfactory over the past ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But is this really true?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Looking at the euro area as a whole, growth on average has been the same as in the decade preceding the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.95,0)">There have been no recessions, while there was one in each decade before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Cyclical variability has been reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.52,0)">Budget deficits have been substantially lower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.51,0)">Employment growth has been much faster in the last ten years and unemployment has reached a 25-year low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Overall, in terms of economic activity, the last decade might not have been particularly brilliant, at least in the eyes of some, but it has been at least as good as the previous one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.33,0)">Incidentally, this is not the case for the US, which saw weaker economic growth overall in the last decade compared with the previous 10 years, and even a recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.46,0)">Some will claim that growth has been geographically patchy, with certain countries performing better than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Indeed, eight out of the first 12 euro area countries have enjoyed economic growth comparable with that of the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">A few, in particular the larger ones, have not performed so well compared with the previous decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Germany and Italy, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Portugal too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">France has performed better since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">I should add though that Germany has caught up over the last three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.51,0)">If economic growth differs across countries, with some doing particularly well and others not so well, where is the problem?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.82,0)">Is it the fault of the euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.13,0)">Is it the fault of EMU?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.94,0)">Is it the fault of Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Some will answer yes, although for totally different reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.68,0)">On the one hand, you have those who think that insufficient growth is the result of insufficient economic policy coordination at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The solution, they would go on saying, is to create further European procedures, further initiatives to improve the economic governance of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.42,0)">On the other hand, you have those who believe that insufficient growth is due to the bureaucracy of Europe’s institutions, which leads to excessive regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The solution is, in this case, to give power back to the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.98,0)">Both views – in my opinion – are wrong, but they add to the confusion surrounding Europe, EMU and the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.56,0)">Ireland’s recent rejection of the Lisbon Treaty reflects the confusion that many citizens feel about Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">What is needed, first and foremost, is clarity on who does what and who is responsible for what in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Some things are pretty clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">For instance, who is in charge of the main instrument for achieving price stability in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.57,0)">It’s the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And who is mainly responsible for enhancing economic growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Who has the main instruments to achieve this objective?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">By and large, it’s the Member States which are responsible for most of the policies that affect economic growth, from education to product and labour market regulation, from taxation to research and technology, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.85,0)">If economic growth has been less satisfactory in some Member States than in others, the main reason lies in one of these policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is what the Lisbon process is all about: to facilitate comparisons between the economic performance of different countries, based on a few key indicators and objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The process should encourage the laggards to catch up with the better performers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.58,0)">What has happened instead?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.02,0)">The Lisbon agenda has been blamed for Europe’s unsatisfactory growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.04,0)">It’s like blaming the thermometer when you’ve got the flu!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.22,0)">The real problem of the last ten years has been the lack of clarity on the level of policy responsibility between national and European decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.3,0)">This has created confusion for the citizens of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">That, in fact, is the main challenge of the next decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.71,0)">Too frequently “Europe” has been blamed for decisions taken by the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.5,0)">For example, only a few months after signing the Stability and Growth Pact, some declared it “stupid”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.34,0)">Others blamed that same Pact for obliging them to adopt tough budgetary policies, rather than explaining that these policies were for the good of their countries and of future generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.14,0)">People inevitably asked: if the Pact is stupid, why did we sign it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.87,0)">And if it is indeed stupid, why do we have policies that comply with it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.51,0)">Too frequently the European Union has been asked to act on specific issues by the national authorities, but the latter have not given the EU the means and powers to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">How many times have there been calls for a common energy policy by the very same authorities who were at the same time negotiating bilateral agreements with energy producers?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.66,0)">Of course, there have been other cases of similarly inconsistent or even contradictory behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.95,0)">Too frequently the institutional set-up of the European Union has been criticised openly, and sometimes severely, by some national authorities or even other European institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.11,0)">How can the people of Europe grow to trust the EU if the decision-makers at various levels question each others’ competencies?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.9,0)">The obvious example for me in this context is the ECB, whose independence and mandate have been repeatedly – and pointlessly – called into question over the past ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We can’t take up the challenges of the next ten years if we don’t build on the assets achieved over the past ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.56,0)">Calling for more cooperation at European level, for more procedures, more initiatives threatens to compound the confusion that already exists in the minds of both ordinary people and policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">For instance, in its EMU@10 Communication, the Commission proposes that the Eurogroup should strengthen its monitoring of the implementation of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.77,0)">Closer monitoring may help shore up a commitment to reform, but there is a real risk of further blurring the delineation of responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.13,0)">I do not want to suggest that everything is going fine as it is in the allocation of responsibilities and that only a clarification is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I just want to draw your attention to what I consider a major risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.17,0)">Recent experience shows that opaqueness and lack of clarity undermine our fellow citizens’ respect for and even their interest in the European “construction”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The European Union will face many challenges in the next few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Globalisation will continue, with its ups and downs, as in the past, and increased pressure on the use of finite resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">These challenges will require better policies, both at national and European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">But, as I just mentioned, we should make clear which decisions are taken at national level and which ones entail a transfer of responsibility or closer cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.06,0)">Confusion should be avoided, as it is a recipe for failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.16,0)">There is one big, uncomfortable fact that Europe and its Member States have to face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As time goes by, their relative weight in the world economy will decrease.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.66,0)">If recent trends continue, by 2020 the share held by the European economy will fall from around 23% to 18% of the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.49,0)">Germany’s economy, the largest in the EU, will fall from 4% to 3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In the decade thereafter, China and possibly India could overtake the whole of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">To be sure, the influence of individual Member States on world affairs will diminish steadily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.99,0)">This is nothing new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The first President of the European Parliament, Paul-Henri Spaak, commented 50 years ago: “Today, Europe consists solely of small countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.0,0)">The only relevant distinction that remains is that some countries understand this, while others still refuse to acknowledge it”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This is even more true today but will become a dramatic reality in a few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The euro area, and more generally the EU countries, have to make a choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.66,0)">Do they want to have a say in the governance of globalisation or do they want to opt out of it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.62,0)">The answer is not obvious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I have the impression that some would like the EU to become something like a a large-scale Switzerland, some kind of neutral bloc staying aside from major world problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Assuming that the EU, or the euro area, wants to be an active player on the global stage, is it then ready to accept the consequences, particularly in terms of internal governance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Again, the answer does not seem to be obvious to many.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">If the Member States still want to have a say in world economic matters, but cannot achieve this through national representation, simply because as nations they are becoming less relevant, will they accept a pooling of their representation, at euro area or EU level?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.56,0)">Or do they prefer to maintain their national seats around increasingly irrelevant tables?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.96,0)">These are not easy questions to answer, nor easy decisions to take politically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In a system where national prestige has still a political meaning, in the sense that it brings votes, and that political accountability in Europe remains based mainly at national level, it’s not easy to transfer responsibility to a higher level of government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.43,0)">This is a dilemma that Europe, and its Member States, have to face, whether they like it or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.49,0)">But it’s better to have this debate out in the open than to fudge it by creating hollow structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.47,0)">The problem for the EU is that its citizens do not see it as helping to solve their everyday problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.45,0)">The way to address this challenge is not to choose the middle ground, which would ultimately penalise the European “construction”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Either it must be understood and clearly stated that certain policies and instruments are better performed at European level and the corresponding competencies transferred to that level, as has been the case with monetary and competition policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Or those policies and instruments should remain unequivocally in the hands of national governments, and the inevitable process of coordination, even if strengthened, should not overshadow that level of responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.49,0)">Looking ahead to the next ten years, it’s better to ask some hard questions than to paper over the cracks and sow confusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There are several areas where these questions need to be asked, especially in respect of international financial institutions and policies, and banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The time might not be ripe for making substantive changes in some of these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.26,0)">However, it will have to be made clear why certain solutions are not followed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This is what accountability is all about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.2,0)">Let me provide an example: people are facing a variety of problems resulting from the rise in commodity prices, in particular a decline in their purchasing power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">One solution – in my view, the only solution for commodity importers – is to increase productivity in the goods and services sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">There are substantial margins for improvement in the services sector, especially if one compares Europe’s economy with that of the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">How can we achieve these improvements?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Each country can look after itself and adopt specific measures, as long as they are compatible with the single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The EU, with the consensus of its Member States, can launch its own initiative to increase competition in the services sector throughout the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.84,0)">This solution might be more efficient, but it has partly failed in the past as some Member States opposed it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Can it be revitalised in light of more recent developments?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A choice has to be made, and it should be clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Economic and Monetary Union has recently celebrated its tenth anniversary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.79,0)">As a ten-year-old, EMU is becoming less of a child and more of an adolescent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The trials of childhood were manifold: the creation of a credible central bank, the design of an effective and transparent monetary strategy, the distribution of new banknotes and coins, and the shaping of sound economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.39,0)">Getting any of these basics wrong would have had catastrophic consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Yet EMU has successfully overcome the challenges of its childhood, while withstanding the many external shocks of the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.17,0)">The trials of adolescence are lurking ahead and will prove equally demanding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The continued success of EMU will depend on how effectively these new challenges are addressed.</span>
