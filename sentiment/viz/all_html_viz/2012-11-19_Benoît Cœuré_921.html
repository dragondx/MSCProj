    <span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)"> Towards a consistent, coherent and complete Economic and Monetary Union Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the conference “Financial Stability and the Single Market – the Keys to Growth in Europe” on the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the Single Market organised by the European Commission,Brussels, 19 November 2012 Introduction Commissioner Barnier, Ladies and Gentlemen,   I would like to thank the European Commission for inviting me to speak at this conference on “Financial Stability and the Single Market”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.69,0)">The crisis has demonstrated the incomplete character of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">Much thought has already been given to diagnosing the issues, identifying the shortcomings of our current institutional set-up and outlining possible solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Further food for thought will no doubt be offered throughout the day in this room.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But the time that lies ahead is the time to take decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Since the publication in June of the first draft of the “Four Presidents’ Report” on the future of EMU, the commitment by the European Council to the banking union, the ECB’s decision on Outright Monetary Transactions, and also thanks to visible adjustment efforts in euro area countries, there has been a return of confidence in the outlook for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.13,0)">Both the status quo and a piecemeal approach to EMU reform would weaken the assumptions underlying this return of confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Today, therefore, I wish to make a plea for consistency, coherence and completeness in the institutional reforms we are seeking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And I will do so by elaborating on each of the building blocks identified by the four Presidents in June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">What I will do for each of these building blocks is to highlight in what respect EMU is incomplete, why it matters, and how the situation can, in my view, at least be remedied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In doing so, I hope it will become clear to you how these four building blocks form a consistent whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Why the euro needs a banking union Let me begin with the so-called financial or banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.75,0)">The heart of the problem here is the fragmentation of the euro area banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.6,0)">I will not dwell on the symptoms of fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">They are well known and have been documented, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.89,0)">in the ECB’s reports on Financial Integration in Europe and Financial Stability Reviews, and have covered, among other matters, the renationalisation of interbank markets, dispersion of bank funding costs and bank lending rates along national lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Equally well documented is the high correlation between the creditworthiness of banks, as well as their funding conditions, and the creditworthiness of their respective government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The ultimate protection of senior bank creditors, depositors in particular, comes from the fiscal backstop provided – or not – by the sovereign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.78,0)">It is therefore not surprising that the fragmentation of the banking system along national lines only became visible and damaging after the start of the sovereign debt crisis, even though the fault lines had existed beneath the surface.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The fundamental reason why this matters is that the single currency is really single only if the banking system is also single.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.92,0)">Money, remember, is the liability of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.0,0)">Base money, issued by the Eurosystem, is undoubtedly single, but it represents only a fraction of broad money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">The remainder is issued by commercial banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.58,0)">If the credit of the banking system – including deposits – is fragmented along national lines, then so is money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.15,0)">More prosaically, if there is a national bias in the funding cost of banks, then monetary policy impulses cannot be transmitted uniformly across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">So how can the singleness of the banking system be ensured?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">The first option would be to strengthen the creditworthiness of individual sovereigns so that differences between them became negligible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It would mean moving to the situation, not as it was, but as it should have been, and was perceived to be before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Under this approach, national governments would remain responsible for backstopping their banking system, but this backstop would be robust across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.56,0)">This is appealing, but it has two shortcomings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.39,0)">First, current conditions are not favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Most governments have excessive levels of public debt and will need several years to restore their creditworthiness to the point where all could be deemed equally robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In the meantime, bank access to funding would remain fragmented along national lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.99,0)">This would perpetuate divergences in the conditions of access to credit for firms and households, and jeopardise national adjustment efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.55,0)">The potential for negative feedback loops or “multiple equilibriums”, to use the economic jargon, is obvious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.88,0)">National economies would continue to diverge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.57,0)">The second shortcoming is that this approach assumes that market discipline is totally effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The “keeping the house in order” approach functions if markets are correctly differentiating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">I am a firm believer in the usefulness of market signals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.61,0)">But we know from what happened before and during the crisis that we cannot always rely on market signals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.52,0)">The alternative is that the banking system is backstopped at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.77,0)">In other terms, the link between national banking systems and their sovereign is severed and replaced by a relationship between the euro area banking system as a whole and European institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In that case, we would truly have a single banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Here again, several options can be envisaged, but the key is completeness and consistency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What it means, in my view, is the following.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.75,0)">A genuine banking union is one where the location of deposits does not play a role in the confidence they inspire.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This will require three interconnected elements: first, a strong, single supervisory mechanism to prevent crises; second, a common resolution scheme which allows effective and early decisions to be taken if a crisis nonetheless occurs; and third, eventually, a common European backstop which can be called upon in the event that there is still a need for public resources despite the involvement of the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">These three elements are complementary and mutually reinforcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Since work on the SSM has advanced the most, and since it involves the ECB as host, let me make a few observations in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, it is crucial that all banks are covered by the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.95,0)">A two-tier system would result in an uneven playing field, effectively segmenting the banking sector, which is precisely what we are trying to repair.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Putting all banks under the umbrella of the SSM does not mean that supervision would be conducted entirely from Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.69,0)">That would be neither effective nor desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">We should – and would – rely on the resources and knowledge of the national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.77,0)">A second point is that arrangements need to be made to separate financial supervision from the ECB’s monetary policy function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We are examining procedures that would separate clearly the relevant workstreams supporting the two functions, and strictly limit Governing Council involvement in supervisory matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Yet separation should not mean isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">There are important synergies to be achieved between the two functions, an argument that is gaining international recognition and that the Eurosystem made publicly as early as 2001  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.01,0)">Most euro area governors are already banking supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Supervision could allow for better-informed monetary policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In parallel, monetary policy operations could provide useful signals to the supervisory function, for instance, when a bank relies disproportionately on central bank funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The creation of the SSM is an opportunity for Europe to rethink the links between banking supervision and monetary policy in a way that can strengthen both functions and learn the lessons of past banking crises, such as avoiding “zombie banks” infused with central bank money or the evergreening of non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The SSM does not need to be limited to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">As the cornerstone of a financial market union, it is necessary for the euro area, but it is desirable for the EU as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The participation of additional Member States is welcome and would strengthen the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.73,0)">These countries have raised legitimate concerns about a fair involvement in the decision-making of the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">We are working hard on arrangements that would address those concerns consistent with article 127.6 TFEU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Two versions of the fiscal union There exists a link between the notion of a banking union and the second topic highlighted by the four Presidents in June, that is the fiscal union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">A fully-fledged banking union, including resolution and deposit insurance, assumes a partial fiscal union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me note that this does not imply that the structure and powers of the SSM can only be decided upon when we know the full details of the fiscal union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The SSM as such does not have fiscal consequences, and should be implemented promptly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What I am referring to here is a first interpretation of the fiscal union: a limited risk-sharing capacity allowing the absorption of idiosyncratic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.15,0)">These shocks cannot entirely be absorbed by national policies alone, given the constraints imposed by the single monetary policy and the lack of an exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Therefore, there has to be a euro area fiscal capacity, as a form of limited rainy day insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Whether other tasks could be assigned to this common fiscal capacity, such as supporting allocative efficiency, is a matter of choice, not necessity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let me voice two words of caution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">First, such risk-sharing capacity should serve as a complement, not a substitute to fiscal responsibility at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.54,0)">It should not undermine the implementation of the strong national fiscal governance rules enshrined in the Fiscal Compact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Second, the fiscal union should be precisely delineated so that is does not mutate into a transfer union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.12,0)">Transferring resources permanently from core to peripheral countries would be tantamount to accepting that economies will not adjust and that countries will not find their way back in the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This brings me to a second possible interpretation of fiscal union, which refers to a transfer of fiscal governance from the national to the European level, in the form of enforceable control of national budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I would argue that such a transfer of governance would not amount to a loss of sovereignty but to recovering sovereignty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">To be able to borrow in a recession – and crucially to be able to do so at affordable rates – governments rely on confidence among investors that their fiscal position is sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.4,0)">When this confidence is eroded, government debt no longer acts as a safe haven.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.26,0)">The cost of raising finance goes up and this can set adverse debt dynamics in motion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.71,0)">In extreme circumstances, governments can lose access to markets, which has happened in several euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.76,0)">From this perspective, the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area is tantamount to a loss of fiscal sovereignty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">With respect to the establishment of a fiscal union that fully supports the return of the euro area to full viability, we ought therefore to distinguish between fiscal rules which underpin sustainability, and rules of enforcement which underpin credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Fiscal rules, as they have now been designed, agreed, and enshrined, in particular in the six-pack and two-pack legislation as well as the Fiscal Compact, are an important step forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">These rules are designed by reference to structural deficits, thereby assigning clear and realistic medium-term objectives, while allowing for the absorption of cyclical shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Where credibility can still be improved, however, is at the level of enforcement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">A number of ideas have been put forward in this context, including that of endowing a European Commissioner with the power to intervene in national budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Each of these options raises its own set of issues, not least the clear-cut need for strong political legitimacy of any form of control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Which of these two interpretations of the fiscal union should eventually prevail?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I would say both.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Europe is a unique construct that needs to find its own balance between the roles of the euro area and national fiscal responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Economic union The genuine completion of banking and fiscal unions would ensure that the union and its members are better able than they are now to withstand a wide variety of shocks: cyclical shocks, exogenous asymmetric shocks, as well as, if need be, shocks arising from the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.98,0)">There exists, however, a final category of shocks to which monetary union must be impervious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.03,0)">They derive from inadequate policies – labour market policies, for instance – or the absence of corrective policies, which amounts to the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.16,0)">If left unaddressed, this either results in prolonged economic divergence – which is inconsistent with the objectives of the Union, or in permanent fiscal transfers – which is politically unacceptable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">What is necessary here, at the very least, to complete monetary union?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">First and foremost, in my view, is the completion of the single market in all its aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">The European Union is a market economy in which each country can benefit by exploiting its comparative advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The euro was introduced to serve the single market and ensure its viability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The argument is symmetric: the completion of the single market is necessary to allow each country to effectively exploit its comparative advantages and to prevent the imbalances that would otherwise undermine the viability of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">That is why the ECB fully supports the Single Market Acts I and II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.68,0)">Second, where macroeconomic imbalances occur as a consequence of inadequate policies, those imbalances need to be identified early and corrective action taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">I believe that the surveillance tools are now in place, in particular through the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure, and that the emphasis should now be on implementation and enforcement by the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The interim report on the future of EMU in October suggested that euro area Member States could enter into contracts with EU institutions, under which they would commit to undertake specific structural reforms, on the basis of measurable and verifiable targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Correctly designed, those contracts could both enhance national ownership and reinforce – rather than weaken – existing economic coordination procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">There could be a role here for the euro area fiscal capacity, which could provide financial incentives to countries partaking in those contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.87,0)">Political union The last building block identified by the four Presidents in June is political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.68,0)">In fact this is not a separate building block – it cuts across the entire discussion on other points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.61,0)">Decisions that have fiscal consequences require democratic backing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Any form of European control over national policies must be based on political legitimacy and strict accountability, in particular vis-à-vis the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We at the ECB are very well aware of the need for democratic accountability wherever power is delegated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The ECB’s new supervisory task must be matched by additional reporting and accountability channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Yet, I think the general issue here is one of clarification, rather than one of institution-building.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.33,0)">The notion that the euro is a currency without a state is in my view misguided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.64,0)">The euro is a currency with a state, only with a state whose branches of government are not yet clearly defined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Here again, let me explain: As I underlined earlier, the euro was created to serve the single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.88,0)">That market itself is a political construct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It not only presupposes the freedom to play a part in the market – that would be anarchy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It also presupposes the means to protect that freedom, such as the protection of property rights and the enforcement of contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">For there to be a single market, there must be a legislative body that establishes the rules and a judiciary that can enforce them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.22,0)">If there is a legislative and a judiciary, there has to be an executive arm to implement their decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">For a market to function, the three branches of government have to exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.93,0)">This makes the single market a political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What is not yet entirely clear in the case of the euro area, and apart from the ECB which has a clear but limited mandate, is who exactly will execute these powers, and to whom it will be accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">As we move towards a genuine EMU, this clarification will become ever more necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Conclusion Mr Commissioner, Ladies and gentlemen, There has always existed a debate as to whether the euro area is an optimum currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.45,0)">I think this is a flawed debate, if by optimum we mean perfect, because no currency area is ever perfect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The question we are facing is what the minimum conditions are to ensure the full viability of the euro area over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">As I said in my introduction, there has been increasing confidence in recent months that these conditions will be met.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Financial market participants have understood that there exists a political commitment to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Practical decisions are needed now to anchor this confidence and commitment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.93,0)">I will end my remarks by quoting – as is appropriate within these walls – from none other than Jean Monnet: “Ce qui est important, ce n'est, ni d'être optimiste, ni pessimiste, mais d'être déterminé.”</span>
