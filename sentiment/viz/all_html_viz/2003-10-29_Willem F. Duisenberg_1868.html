    <span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)"> Address delivered on the occasion of a special ECOFIN dinner to pay tribute to his leadership of the European Central Bank Dr. Willem F Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank,Venice, 29 October 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.81,0)">It is time to say goodbye.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">After more than five years of steering the ECB through the high seas, it is time for me to return to port and drop my anchor in more tranquil waters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.66,0)">Over the past few weeks, a lot of people have asked me how I feel about retiring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.78,0)">I have told them that my feelings are mixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.61,0)">Half of me, Wim Duisenberg the private man, wishes that I had gone already.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.56,0)">As you know, I had announced my intention to retire already last July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.45,0)">But for the other half of me, Wim Duisenberg the central banker, it will be more difficult letting go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Without a doubt, the last five years have been the pinnacle of my career.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">It has been an honour and a privilege to be the first President of the European Central Bank; to be bestowed the task of rearing, nurturing, and then guarding Europe's young currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Europe has made history and I have been given a place at the heart of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I couldn't ask for more than that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.11,0)">In years to come, history will be the judge of our success, or our failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">I hope that history will be kind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">The last few years have already been littered with outstanding achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It was not so long ago that most people doubted that the single currency would ever see the light of day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Then, when they saw that it would, they speculated that only a few countries would be able to join.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">But they underestimated the resolve of European governments to be part of this great step forward in Europe's history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Since then, we have witnessed the two changeovers; the introduction of the euro in book-entry form and then in the form of banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Both went smoothly, not because they were easy, but because of the hard work of all involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And of course, for nearly five years now, we have had a single monetary policy conducted by the European Central Bank for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.93,0)">During this time, the Bank has not been without its critics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.28,0)">I have not been without my critics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.83,0)">The nature of that criticism depended on which newspapers you read.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.65,0)">If you read the Anglo-Saxon press, then we paid too much attention to monetary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It seems that money shouldn't matter for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.42,0)">If you read the German press, well the story was different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.89,0)">Some said we communicated too little.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.91,0)">Others said we communicated too much.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.29,0)">When you are flanked on both sides, then you must be somewhere in the middle of the park.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">I conclude from this that we must have positioned ourselves more or less right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Indeed over time, I think that the "ECB watchers" have increasingly come to understand and to respect our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">We have also become better at explaining it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is an ongoing process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">But things are on the right track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Most importantly, we have done our duty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">We have maintained price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">And we have done it in a pragmatic fashion, with a steady hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.63,0)">There were many who feared that in the early years of EMU, the euro area economy might be a sacrificial lamb on the altar of credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.33,0)">According to this view, the ECB would raise interest rates unnecessarily to prove its anti-inflation credentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.78,0)">The facts do not bear this out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.14,0)">A number of shocks have hit the euro area economy over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But we did not over-react.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">We held our nerve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Even in its infancy, the ECB showed itself to be a mature central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">I am proud to have been its President these past five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I do not retire without some regret.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.96,0)">There is a lot that I shall miss.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.46,0)">I shall miss my colleagues in the Executive Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.86,0)">I shall miss my colleagues in the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.5,0)">I shall certainly miss the regular meetings and contacts I have with many of you, especially in the Eurogroup.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">I have to say that I was touched when I received your invitation to this special dinner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">And I am touched that so many of you have taken the trouble to travel to Venice to say goodbye.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.62,0)">Since this is the first time that a President of the European Central Bank has retired, I have no way of knowing if this is just standard protocol, or if it is something more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">I hope it is not just that you are eager, as you said in your invitation, to "facilitate my departure".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">I prefer to think that it reflects the warm relationship that has been built up among us during the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I remember when it was first proposed to establish a Eurogroup, or "Euro-X" as it was then called.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.37,0)">And I remember that some people said that such a group would be a threat to the ECB and its independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.79,0)">Frankly speaking, I also had some doubts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.19,0)">I was proved wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">As I have since said in public on various occasions, the Eurogroup meetings represent a "golden opportunity"; a golden opportunity for dialogue; a golden opportunity to be open, to be frank, to be honest, to criticise, and to listen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">If you liken EMU to a house, then we are its family, and the Eurogroup is the dinner table.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It is where the family members get together to tell each other what they are doing, to listen to each others advice, and learn to live together, as they must do, responsibly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Each member who joined this family did so on the understanding that his new house would be built on two stable pillars; not just a sound monetary policy, but also sound economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">They signed up to a package, a clear set of rules, including a Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is a contract not just among governments but a contract with every single citizen of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is on the basis of this contract that they have accepted the loss of their monetary sovereignty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">And it is on this contract that the confidence in our new currency, not just of European citizens, but also of markets and of those on the outside looking in, is based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.99,0)">If you break this contract, this confidence will be lost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.52,0)">I acknowledge that these are not easy times, that conditions are adverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">But the difficulties that some of you now face were not entirely unforeseen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Not unforeseen when the Pact was signed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Not unforeseen when the conditions were more favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.8,0)">You were warned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The rules were not designed just for the good times, but also for the bad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.07,0)">The difficulties that some of you now face do not provide grounds for tinkering with the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">They call for their implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The rules are there to help not to hinder efforts to put the house in order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">They should be allowed to do what they were designed for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.56,0)">Otherwise I fear the Pact will unravel, the contract with the people will be broken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.53,0)">Without the right foundations, you cannot build a stable house.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">I hear some of you say that the house needs more than stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">It also needs growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Of course you are right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Stability and growth go hand in hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">But for growth there is also a strategy, a good one, agreed in Lisbon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">I welcome the efforts that have already been made and that are being made to implement this strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">There has been some progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.2,0)">I do not need to tell you that there is a lot still to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">You have said so yourselves many times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">These good words must be transformed into actions, and soon, because time is running out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.52,0)">It is no good having the right diagnosis if you don't apply the medicine and cure the disease.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The challenges for EMU over the next five years are every bit as great as those already faced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.07,0)">I am fortunate enough not to have to deal with them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">I have done my bit, as well as I could.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is where I "pass the buck".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Europe is making history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">It now falls to my successor, Jean-Claude Trichet, and to you to do your best to make sure that in the end history judges our new, shared currency to be a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">I wish Jean-Claude well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">I wish you well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">I raise my glass to your success.</span>
