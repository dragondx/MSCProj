    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)"> The role of the Central Bank in the United Europe Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, National Bank of Poland, Warsaw, Poland on 4 May 1999 Introduction First and foremost, I should like to congratulate the National Bank of Poland   on its 75th anniversary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.49,0)">The age of the NBP already suggests that as the President of the European Central Bank  , an institution that is even less than one year old and has only been conducting monetary policy since January this year, I should be modest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">I am aware that the role of the NBP has not been constant over these 75 years and that in the past decade, in particular, the NBP has gone through a remarkable restructuring process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">My previous central bank, de Nederlandsche Bank, has, together with the International Monetary Fund and many national central banks, been involved in assisting the NBP in its efforts to adapt to the role of a central bank in a market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Of course, the real work had to be done by you yourselves and I believe you can be proud of what has been achieved over the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Today in my speech I should like to focus on the role of the ECB, as a truly European institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">First of all, I shall explain the background against which the introduction of the euro and the establishment of the ECB should be considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Thereafter, I shall discuss the main features of the institutional structure that determines monetary policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I shall then turn to our monetary policy strategy and the role of accountability and transparency in this strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I shall conclude by briefly addressing the issue of EU enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The process of European integration On 1 January of this year the euro was introduced in 11 countries with a combined population of almost 300 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The ECB started to conduct a single monetary policy for the so-called euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.57,0)">Former national currencies, such as the French franc and the German Mark are no longer autonomous currencies, but subdivisions of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Euro banknotes and coins will only be introduced in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The voluntary transfer of monetary sovereignty from the national to the European level is unique in history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.57,0)">However, it should not be seen as a single, isolated event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The introduction of the euro is part of the process of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This process started shortly after the second World War and has now been under way for more than half a century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The aims of European integration are not only, or even primarily, economic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Indeed, this process has been driven and continues to be driven by the political conviction that an integrated Europe will be safer, more stable and more prosperous than a fragmented Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">It is true that economic integration has been the main engine of this process and that, although it has had its ups and downs, integration has delivered important economic benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">On balance it has been successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">The introduction of the euro and the establishment of the ECB are important new steps in this process of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.48,0)">They are not the completion of this process, for at least two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">First, the launch of the euro can be compared to the launch of a rocket.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">A good launch is crucial, but only the beginning of the mission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The euro has been launched successfully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The challenge now is to make it a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This will not happen automatically, but will require effort on the part of many authorities, institutions and people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.25,0)">Second, four EU Member States have not   introduced the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">I hope that this will happen in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Moreover, as you are aware, the EU itself is likely to increase its membership over time, also to include Poland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Ultimately, this is bound to extend the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">This process, too, is already requiring and will continue to require great efforts: no pain, no gain, as is often the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The institutional framework of the single monetary policy Let me now turn to the institutional framework for the conduct of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This was laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community, the so-called Maastricht Treaty, and the Statute of the ESCB, which is an integral part of this Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">According to the Treaty the ECB has the primary objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Without prejudice to this objective, it is to support the general economic policies in the Community, with objectives such as economic growth and high employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.88,0)">Decisions on monetary policy are made by the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">This body comprises the six executive directors of the ECB and the 11 governors of the national central banks   of the Member States which have introduced the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.36,0)">These 17 people meet every fortnight at the ECB, in Frankfurt am Main.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Decision-making on monetary policy is fully centralised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.91,0)">All members of the Governing Council have one vote, whether they come from Germany or Luxembourg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is because of an important principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">They are not representing their country, but are obliged to take decisions on the basis of euro area-wide considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.49,0)">Regional or national monetary policy does not and cannot exist in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.99,0)">There is only one, single monetary policy for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Therefore, the ECB should develop into a truly European institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This is a process that will inevitably take some time, but my feeling is that we are already making good progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The execution of monetary policy is to a great extent decentralised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It is in large part carried out by the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.23,0)">The ECB and the 11 NCBs together are referred to as the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">If we refer to the ECB and the 15 NCBs of all EU Member States, we speak of the European System of Central Banks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.01,0)">The General Council of the ECB meets quarterly and comprises the President and Vice-President of the ECB and the 15 governors of the NCBs of all the EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.21,0)">This body does not make decisions on monetary policy, but discusses issues concerning the relationship between the "ins" and the countries I prefer to call "pre-ins", such as exchange rate issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.52,0)">The third decision-making body of the ECB is the Executive Board of the ECB, comprising the six executive directors of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.34,0)">The Executive Board is responsible for current business and the implementation of monetary policy as decided by the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">The staff of the ECB will, in the course of this year, reach a level of between 750 and 800 and is likely to grow further in the years ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The ECB is one of the most, if not the most, independent central bank in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Its independence and that of the participating national central banks are firmly enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.08,0)">Members of the Governing Council are not allowed to take or seek instructions from anybody, politicians included.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.13,0)">Politicians are not allowed to give such instructions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.01,0)">Members of the Governing Council have a term of office of at least five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.58,0)">The ECB is financially independent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The independent status of the ECB fits into the recent world-wide trend of granting independence to central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This tendency is evidenced by both practical experience and academic research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">By shielding monetary policy decisions from political interference, price stability can be maintained without having to give up economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Indeed, in that sense having an independent central bank is a good thing for all concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.65,0)">The reason for central bank independence is that monetary policy-making under the influence of politicians tends to focus too much on short-term considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This can easily lead to temporary, non-sustainable increases in growth, but inevitably results in lasting increases in inflation with no lasting gains in growth and employment at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Politicians all over the world have come to realise this and have decided to remove the temptation to pursue short-term gains and to make their central bank independent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It should be underlined that granting this independence is, as it should be, a political decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">An independent central bank needs a clear legal mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The monetary policy strategy The ECB has, as I mentioned earlier, such a mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">However, the Treaty does not specify how the ECB should pursue its primary objective of maintaining price stability; in other words: it is silent on what is called the monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The ECB therefore formulated its strategy in the second half of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">That was no easy task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.35,0)">The introduction of the euro constitutes a structural break, which may change the behaviour of firms and individuals and make it less predictable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">To a certain extent it is comparable to what Poland experienced when it embarked on its reform process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.54,0)">The rules of the game change and this makes policy-making more complicated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Our monetary policy strategy has taken these specific circumstances into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is tailored to this unique period of the introduction of the euro, although it has elements of both monetary targeting and inflation targeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In the context of this strategy the ECB has provided a quantitative definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Price stability is defined as a year-on-year increase in the harmonised index of consumer prices   of below 2% for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Price stability is to be maintained in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The strategy consists of two pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The first pillar is a prominent role for money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.62,0)">Ultimately, inflation is a monetary phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.13,0)">It is in the end result of too much money chasing too few goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Therefore, we have formulated a reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate, M3, of 4 ½% on an annual basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Growth of the money stock at this pace would provide the economy with sufficient liquidity for growth in activity in line with trend growth, without inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.1,0)">At the end of this year this figure will be reviewed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It should be emphasised that we did not define a target for money growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.83,0)">The reason for this is the structural break that the introduction of the euro creates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">By calling this a reference value, it is made clear that money is one variable which we look at very carefully in order to examine whether inflationary or deflationary pressures are tending to emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.31,0)">We do not, however, react mechanistically to changes in money growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The formulation of the second pillar is also prompted by the potential changes in economic behaviour on account of the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments on the basis of an analysis of monetary, financial and economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.32,0)">In this context interest rates, the yield curve, wage developments, public finance, the output gap, surveys of economic sentiment and many other indicators are analysed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Use is also made of forecasts produced by other bodies and internally for inflation and other economic variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This brings me to the role of the exchange rate of the euro in our strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Since our primary objective is price stability and since the euro area as a whole is a relatively closed economy with an export share of 14% of gross domestic product, we do not have a target for the exchange rate of the euro, for example, against the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.98,0)">This does not mean, and it is good to underline this once more, that the ECB is indifferent to the external value of the euro or even neglects it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The external value of the euro is one of the indicators we look at in the broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Within that framework, we constantly monitor exchange rate developments, analyse them and shall act on them, if and when this becomes necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, such action will never be mechanistic, nor will it be isolated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The external value of the euro and its development are analysed and considered in the context of other indicators of future price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">The ECB also tries to assess international confidence in the still very young euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Of course, the level of international confidence in the euro is not the only factor determining its external value, nor is the exchange rate the only indicator of confidence in the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">It is, for instance, encouraging to see how the euro has been received on the international money and capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">I am sure that an internally stable euro will also strongly underpin international confidence in this currency, as it has for other currencies in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As the currency of a very large area, the issue of the international role of the euro naturally arises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.02,0)">The ECB takes a neutral stance regarding this role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It will neither be stimulated, nor hindered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.63,0)">On the one hand, an international currency has advantages for citizens in the euro area, on the other, it may sometimes complicate the conduct of monetary policy when a large amount of euro is circulating outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We shall leave the development of the international role of the euro to market participants and market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">If history is a guide as to what will happen, there will be a gradual process whereby the euro will have an increasingly international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Such a gradual development would also be a welcome development, if only to prevent the euro from becoming too strong externally at some point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">It is likely and understandable that interest in the euro is already considerable in those countries aspiring to join the EU, including Poland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I shall elaborate on this issue at the end of my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Coming back to our monetary policy strategy, I should like to point out that it is important to make clear what monetary policy can and cannot do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Monetary policy can maintain price stability, but only in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the short term prices are also influenced by non-monetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.87,0)">Moreover, monetary policy measures only have an impact on prices with long, variable and not entirely predictable time-lags of between 1.5 and 2 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Therefore, monetary policy-making should have a forward-looking character.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.8,0)">Today's inflation is the result of past policy measures, and current policy measures only affect future inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.54,0)">The uncertainty of the economic process in a market economy is another reason for policy-makers to be modest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.84,0)">The ECB does not pursue an activist policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.19,0)">Precise steering of the business cycle or a cyclically-oriented monetary policy are not feasible and are likely to destabilise rather than stabilise the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Some commentators have interpreted our recent interest rate reduction as a change to a more cyclically-oriented monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.41,0)">This is not true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Our strategy was, is and shall remain medium term-oriented and firmly focused on maintaining the price stability which currently prevails in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Monetary policy should be supported by sound budgetary policies and wage developments in line with productivity growth and taking into account the objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.04,0)">Otherwise, price stability can only be maintained at a high cost in terms of lost output and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This also explains why independence should not mean isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It is important to have a regular exchange of information and views with other policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.53,0)">The Maastricht Treaty stipulates that the President of the ECB is invited to meetings of the EU Council meeting in the composition of the Ministers of Economy and Finance whenever there are issues on the agenda which are relevant to the ECB's tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.5,0)">The President of the Council of Ministers and a member of the European Commission may attend meetings of the Governing Council, although they do not have the right to vote.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.8,0)">The President of the Council of Ministers may submit motions for deliberation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Apart from these formal contacts, there are many informal contacts, for example in the context of the so-called Euro-11 group of finance ministers from the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I regularly attend meetings of this group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.62,0)">Monetary policy cannot be used to solve structural problems, such as the unacceptably high level of unemployment in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Structural problems call for structural solutions, in this case measures targeted at making labour and product markets work more flexibly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The best contribution the ECB's monetary policy can make in this context is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In this way one of the conditions for sustainable growth in incomes and employment is created.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">As important as this is, it should be realised that jobs are created by firms which are confident about the future and not by central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Accountability and transparency Accountability for policies is the logical complement to independence in a democratic society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The Maastricht Treaty includes a number of provisions in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">First, there is the mandate to pursue price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This provides a qualitative measure against which the ECB's performance can be measured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">As I have already mentioned, we have decided to enhance this by providing a quantitative definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">One of the aims of publishing our monetary policy strategy is to make our policy decisions transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.52,0)">The ECB has to publish an annual report in which, inter alia, the monetary policy of the previous and current year are discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I present this Annual Report to the EU Council and to the European Parliament, which may hold a general debate on the basis of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.17,0)">The President and other members of the Executive Board of the ECB may be heard by the competent committees of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I have agreed to appear before the European Parliament at least four times a year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.82,0)">The ECB has to report on its activities at least quarterly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It has been decided to go beyond this requirement and to publish a monthly bulletin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is my view that the main way to achieve accountability is through being transparent and open.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">In passing, I should like to note that transparency also enhances the effectiveness of a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The better it is understood, the more successful a central bank is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Apart from the activities I have already mentioned, transparency is achieved in several ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.85,0)">Every month, after the first meeting of the Governing Council, the Vice-President and I give a press conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I start the conference with a comprehensive introductory statement, in which I explain the decisions taken by the Governing Council and the underlying analysis and arguments for and against.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.64,0)">This introductory statement is published immediately on the ECB's Internet Web site.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is followed by a question and answer session attended by several hundred journalists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.97,0)">The questions and answers are also published on the Internet shortly afterwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.64,0)">All the members of the Governing Council frequently make speeches, give interviews and contribute to journals and books.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Thousands of people visit the ECB and the national central banks each year and, for our part, we and our staff attend many conferences and other public events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">EU enlargement The European integration process continues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">The euro should be made a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I have already explained how we have started the process of doing that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.4,0)">Some observers have criticised the EU for its "obsession with its own internal dynamics", in particular in the context of European Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.07,0)">With all energies focused on meeting the convergence criteria and the preparation for the launch of the euro, Europeans outside the EU have wondered whether EMU and enlargement are not mutually exclusive objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">Let me briefly comment on this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">After the historic decision to complete the European Single Market in the 1980s, it was felt that economic integration should not stop at that point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">To fully reap the rewards of economic integration within the Community, a single currency was felt necessary; a logic pointedly encapsulated in the title of one report: "One market, one money".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Hence, the underlying idea of EMU was to advance European integration and to ensure that full use would be made of the economic potential of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">This idea continues to be the focus of European policy-makers, as evidenced by the association agreements and the ongoing accession negotiations with a number of European countries, Poland among them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Good and mutually beneficial economic relations with third countries in Europe and further afield are a pillar of EU policy orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Recognising this, the principles of an open market economy with free competition are enshrined in the Treaty on European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">EMU will not weaken this commitment, but rather reinforce it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Closer co-operation in Europe and the respect of common principles in the political, economic and social fields are likely to form the basis for further integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The ECB shall contribute to this process within the scope of its responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Countries wishing to deepen their monetary co-operation to the ultimate extent possible by forming a monetary union will have to adapt their economic and legal systems to the standards required by the Treaty and aim at a sufficient degree of economic convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.38,0)">In the absence of these conditions, adjustment costs for both current and new participants could be high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.19,0)">Any premature decision on the adoption of the euro could have severe repercussions on a country's competitiveness and trigger painful economic adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Therefore, implementation of the necessary institutional reforms and of a sufficient degree of convergence should not be considered as an obstacle preventing further integration in Europe, but rather as an essential means of ensuring the lasting success of EMU, for existing and new participants alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Looking at the impressive progress made in a relatively short time in this country, there is no reason to be pessimistic about Poland's chances of meeting these standards and convergence criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.25,0)">I shall not venture, however, to predict when this will be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.37,0)">Even at the current juncture, though, EMU in one part of Europe is already having an impact on the whole region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Let me briefly mention two aspects: If the euro emerges, as I believe it will, as a strong and stable currency, it will provide the countries in the region with an important reference currency, an anchor towards which, should the intention arise, monetary policy could credibly be oriented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Furthermore, EMU is set to bring about the development of a truly unified European financial market, close to that of the United States in depth and sophistication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The competitive pressures of this euro area financial market will create more favourable financing conditions for borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">A number of central and eastern European countries have already successfully tapped this market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In view of these effects, it is altogether natural that the ECB has started to follow with great interest economic and financial developments in the wider Europe, particularly in those countries which have applied for EU membership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Moreover, the ECB monitors closely the exchange rate developments with those countries which have established some form of exchange rate link to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">The euro has the potential to become more than just a new currency for almost 300 million people in 11 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">It may also become a unifying symbol, standing for all that the peoples of Europe have in common.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Consequently, the public perception of the euro could endow the single currency with a role in the European integration process reaching beyond monetary policy in the strict sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">May the euro contribute to the establishment of what the preamble to the Treaty Establishing the European Community calls: "an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe".</span>
