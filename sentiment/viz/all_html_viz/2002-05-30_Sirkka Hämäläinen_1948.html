    <span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)"> The role of the euro in global capital markets Ms Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the Executive Board The sixth European Financial Markets Convention 2002, Flanders European Conference Centre, Brussels, 30 May 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, Let me first thank the Federation of European Securities Exchanges, the organiser of this convention, for focusing on the topics of vital importance for the EU, the euro area and the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In particular I would like to thank the organisers for giving me the opportunity to address this distinguished audience on the role of the euro in global capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The euro is a world currency, there is no doubt about that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">It is currently the currency both of more than 300 million people and of the largest trading partner in the world economy, accounting for almost 20% of world export and more than 15% of world GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The coverage of the euro as a currency has the potential to widen even further – by 60% in terms of population and by 35% in terms of GDP – should all three non-participating EU Member States and all the candidate countries join the single currency in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">I am sure that it is obvious to you that the main goal of the single currency is to produce monetary identity and internal stability for the euro area and to enhance its economic and social performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The global role of the euro is not a goal in itself for the decision-makers – and certainly not for the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This role is and must be fully dependent on market forces and the markets' assessment of the internal stability and economic performance of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The soundness of the economy and, thus, the attractiveness of the currency are based on many elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I would like to classify these elements under four closely interconnected groups: the commitment and credibility of price stability, the efficiency and credibility of overall decision-making, especially economic policy decision-making, economic growth and investment performance measured in terms of relative productivity developments and the efficiency, that is to say variety and depth of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.47,0)">I will not go into detail about these different aspects because they were covered by the previous speaker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">However, I dare say that the first condition is met by the Treaty stipulation which gives monetary policy decision-making price stability as a clear primary goal and by the credibility of the ECB when fulfilling this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Instead, the other three conditions need further efforts to be met.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The overall decision-making process in the EU, including economic policy decision-making, must be improved and simplified; there is clear unanimity on that point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Improved productivity and competitiveness of the euro area economies will only be possible as a result of profound changes in areas such as general attitudes, education, product and labour market regulation and social security systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">And integrating still quite segmented euro area financial markets needs active co-ordination and the readiness on the part of Member States to give up their narrow and short-term-oriented local interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the first few years of the single currency the integration of financial markets was triggered and mainly driven by market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Now the continuation of this process needs concrete, determined decisions to lend support by national authorities and market organisations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Changes in legislation, regulation, market practices and infrastructure are necessary for the deepening and widening of the euro markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The grade or degree of development in euro area financial markets is crucial to the international role of the currency both indirectly and directly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Efficient financial markets could support growth, productivity and income by improving the allocation of savings to investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">At the same time the efficiency of financial markets is a necessary precondition for investors' willingness to place their money in the euro area and, thus, directly affects the direction and magnitude of investment flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.42,0)">What then is the current international role of the euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">As a natural reflection of the development process of the euro area, the different segments or sectors of financial markets are showing a very diversified role for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The euro has so far been much more interesting to market-players as a currency for financing or borrowing than as an investment currency or transaction or pricing currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is likely that this difference in interest was also one factor behind the exchange rate developments during the first three years of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At the same time, however, the euro is used rather widely as a reference currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I will briefly describe the trends in these different segments when assessing the overall picture and role of the euro in a global context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The euro as a financing currency Immediately after the introduction of the euro, its share of the total issuance of bonds, notes and money market instruments increased significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">Even though developments have been rather volatile since then, it seems that, in relative terms, borrowing from the euro money markets has almost tripled to just below 25% of worldwide money market activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Borrowing from the euro bond markets has almost doubled to 35% of the issuance of international bonds and notes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">This development has given the euro an even more prominent role than the dollar in borrowing or issuance flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">What makes this development especially positive is the fact that issuance has increased particularly strongly in the corporate sector, even though the extent of corporate borrowing is still very small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.52,0)">For example, the short-term corporate paper market in Europe is still almost non-existent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">One can identify a number of reasons for increased issuance in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Looking only at the structural reasons, increased liquidity in the markets for euro-denominated bonds, notes and money market instruments is an important reason.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The emergence of deeper markets without currency risks lowered risk premia and, thus, permanently lowered the borrowing costs in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">This favourable structural change was actively exploited by liability managers around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Interestingly, the emergence of a large market and larger issues also attracted non-resident corporate bond underwriters to the euro-denominated market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.77,0)">This entry of new players increased competition and brought down underwriting fees from high levels closely in line with those in the dollar-denominated market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Increased competitive forces in underwriting naturally decreased the borrowing costs, thereby further contributing to increased issuance in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Looking at the amounts outstanding of international debt securities, the growth of issuance has naturally also contributed to the growth of the stock of euro-denominated debt securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">For assessing the international role of the euro the most appropriate measure is the volume of issues which are denominated in currencies other than that of the borrower's country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Using this measure, the share of euro-denominated debt securities in the total amount outstanding of international debt securities – excluding home country issuance – increased during the first three years of the euro at the cost of the other two main currencies, the US dollar and the Japanese yen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.36,0)">But it still stayed 15 percentage points lower than the 43 % share of the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">A similar development has also taken place in international bank liabilities   To sum up, looking at the euro as a financing currency, a structural reduction in the borrowing costs increased the amount outstanding of euro-denominated international debt securities and liabilities immediately after the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The lower liquidity risk premia and foreign exchange risk premia, larger issue sizes, increased competition among intermediaries and a larger pool of potential investors had the immediate effect of lowering the borrowing costs in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Therefore, the growing demand for the euro as a financing currency is hardly surprising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The euro as an investment currency As I mentioned earlier, the euro has been more popular as a financing currency than as an investment currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">For borrowers it is sufficient to have reasonable liquidity and reasonably low costs to borrow in the euro markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Investors are instead interested in income prospects and they demand high efficiency and liquidity of the financial markets, as well as the credibility of both the stability and the efficiency of economic policy decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">The income prospects investors are looking at in the medium term in particular are linked to relative productivity developments vis-à-vis other currency areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.03,0)">Sustained productivity differentials between the euro area and the United States is seen to be one of the main reasons for the poorer relative performance of the euro as an investment currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">As Alan Greenspan has put it: "the future   will be determined, at least in part, by the success in Europe of matching the expected rates of return on US assets"   In addition to income prospects, investors naturally need confidence in the fact that they can – if necessary – liquidate and transfer their assets to other areas and instruments with small risks and low costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This is possible only if the financial markets are deep, wide and highly efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.5,0)">This is not yet the case in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In particular this is not the case in the equities markets of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.24,0)">Continental European equity markets are smaller, on average, than their counterparts in the rest of the industrialised world and they account for a comparatively smaller share of trading activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This is very much a result of the segmentation of national markets, which have been built around national securities depositories and settlement systems intimately connected to the national payment infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Consolidation is inevitable: it is estimated that having a unified platform that could cover the whole euro area would reduce transaction costs by some 60%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Developments around Euronext have been a positive phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">However, the complexities of integrating historically segmented markets and local interest remain considerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.07,0)">As for the statistical information on the euro as an investment currency, it is more scarce and less reliable than information on euro borrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This is particularly true in the case of private sector investments, while more information is available on official investment in euro as part of official reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The euro currently accounts for 13% of total official reserves, whereas the share of the US dollar amounts to 68% and that of the Japanese yen to 5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This share of the euro is comparable with the share which the euro legacy currencies reached prior to the launch of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Part of the reason for the high dollar share is – in addition to its "traditionally" strong status – the relative magnitude of the euro area reserves, where the dollar is a natural investment currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The euro area reserves represent approximately 11% of total official world reserves and 28% of the reserves of industrialised countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">There are indications that the share of the euro in the foreign reserves of other countries is increasing, even though slowly and gradually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">For example, China has publicly announced that it will increase the share of the euro in its reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The evidence from portfolio polls and databases of international bond holdings seems to indicate that no major change has taken place in the role of the euro in the private investment sector when compared with the predecessor currencies prior to the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Despite this we can see that the share of the euro in the bond portfolios of major global asset managers amounted to 30% and in their equity portfolios to 25% in the fourth quarter of last year according to a survey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The corresponding figures for the dollar were about 20 – 25 percentage points higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The euro as a transaction currency Experience tells us that changes in market and pricing practices are very slow and normally only one currency is dominant in the world market as a vehicle currency, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">as a pricing and quotation currency for goods and services as well as in the foreign exchange markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This was shown by the dominance of the Dutch guilder in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the pound sterling in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and the dominance of the dollar thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The attractiveness of a vehicle currency grows as its liquidity increases and, in turn, the increased liquidity makes the vehicle currency even more attractive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.33,0)">We have little information and few statistics on the share of euro as a pricing and quotation currency for international trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.47,0)">The rough Commission data from 2000 estimated that this share was 15-17%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.23,0)">As for the foreign exchange markets, the latest BIS triennial survey from last year shows that the overall turnover in foreign exchange markets declined substantially between 1998 and 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.48,0)">In particular the decline of the so-called spot markets seems to have been caused in part by the cyclical worldwide slowdown and to structural changes on the foreign exchange market, which witnessed strong consolidation developments among market-players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.14,0)">However, the decrease also partly reflected the disappearance of market activity for the euro legacy currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The dollar-euro currency pair is quite naturally the most liquid currency market in the world and it accounts for about one-third of worldwide forex market turnover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">However, dominant use of the dollar as a vehicle currency vis-à-vis other currencies gives it an overwhelming position in the foreign exchange markets in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The euro as a reference currency In order to complete this review of the different international aspects of the euro, its rather wide role as a reference currency needs to be mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Several countries have linked their currencies to the euro in one way or another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">These links include the direct legal use of the euro as an official currency on the basis of an agreement with the European Union  , a bilateral ERM II arrangement between the euro and the Danish krone, the unilateral decision to use the euro  , the unilateral full pegging to the euro via a currency board   and the looser pegging arrangements in many countries in regions neighbouring the EU via currency baskets including the euro or via the euro as a reference currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">All in all, around 50 countries have tied their currencies to the euro – some tighter, some looser – and thus through these ties the countries have anchored their price stability to that of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Concluding remarks I would like to conclude by repeating that the euro is a global currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Strengthening the international role of the euro is not a policy objective of the Eurosystem – and it should not be such for any other policy decision-maker either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">The aim and goal should be to strengthen the integration and economic performance of the EU and to keep "our own euro house in order".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Price stability, fiscal adjustment, the harmonisation of legislatory and regulatory structures, the integration of financial markets and the removal of unnecessary rigidities from product and labour markets are needed for domestic reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The internal economic success of the euro area will then naturally lead to the gradual strengthening of the euro as a global currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The global financial landscape has changed considerably since the launch of the single European currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The introduction of the euro reduced the number of global players and created a more balanced relationship among them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">This has made the process of co-operation more efficient and has strengthened the awareness of all players of the need to take up their respective responsibilities, for example to maintain financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This was evident, for instance, in the prompt and co-ordinated reactions by the major central banks to the terrorist attacks in September of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.1,0)">The global role of the euro and the ongoing developments in domestic and international financial markets are creating big challenges for economic policies and for monetary policy in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The monetary policy transmission mechanism in the euro area will likely change in a gradual manner; for example, the role of financial markets can be expected to grow and the lags can be expected to shorten.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These changes will be very closely scrutinised by the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The ability of the ECB to maintain price stability is not endangered.</span>
