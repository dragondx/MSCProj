    <span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)"> Monetary policy in a pandemic: ensuring favourable financing conditions Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Economics Department and IM-TCD, Trinity College Dublin 26 November 2020 Introduction My aim in this speech today is to explain the role of monetary policy in the pandemic, with a natural focus on the ECB and the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">,   I will first review the monetary policy measures that we have taken in response to the pandemic before highlighting some of the current economic and financial challenges that confront the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">I will then explain why the current priority for monetary policy is to ensure favourable financing conditions to support the economic recovery and counteract the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy measures in 2020: a recap The scale and nature of the pandemic shock called for an extraordinary policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The three main tasks for the ECB since the onset of the pandemic have been: first, to stabilise markets; second, to protect credit supply; and third, to neutralise the pandemic-related downside risks to the inflation path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Addressing the first two challenges are high priorities, given that market instability and/or a credit crunch would undermine the running of an effective monetary policy; meeting the third challenge is central to delivering our price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">In terms of our monetary policy measures, the combination of the already-low levels of our main policy rates and our previously-installed forward guidance on the future path of interest rates   has acted as an automatic stabiliser through the adjustment of policy rate expectations – and hence the entire spectrum of monetary conditions – to pandemic-related changes in the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Since additional monetary policy measures were clearly necessary to meet the scale and special nature of the pandemic shock, we introduced a comprehensive package of complementary measures that acted along two main dimensions:   asset purchases; and   liquidity operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">For asset purchases, an extra €120 billion was added to the ongoing asset purchase programme   on 12 March and the pandemic emergency purchase programme   was launched on 18 March; for liquidity operations, the main element was the revision of the structure and pricing of the targeted longer-term refinancing operations   programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">These flagship initiatives were accompanied by a suite of supporting measures, including the easing of the collateral framework along various dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">,   In parallel to the monetary policy measures, the European banking supervision   and national macroprudential authorities also quickly implemented a host of countercyclical measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The PEPP and the easing of conditions under the TLTRO programme have been the two cornerstones of our monetary policy response: their design and calibration are directly linked to the evolution of the pandemic and its impact on the monetary transmission mechanism and the economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The PEPP plays a dual role of stabilising financial markets and contributing to easing the overall monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The stabilisation function, which is facilitated by the ability to purchase volumes in a flexible manner over time, across asset classes and countries has been successful in addressing fragmentation risks, has provided a stabilising force for markets and has helped to reverse the tightening in financial conditions that was observed earlier in the year, as illustrated by the convergence of the euro area GDP-weighted sovereign yield curve to the overnight indexed swap   curve, which is an important indicator of the euro area risk-free term structure  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Sovereign bond yields, in turn are central for determining the funding conditions of banks, corporates and households across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Moreover, the PEPP eases the monetary policy stance by extracting duration risk held by investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.0,0)">By pushing down the medium-to-long end of the yield curve, the PEPP also reinforces the impact of negative interest rates and forward guidance on the path of policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">This effect was reinforced by an easing of collateral requirements to ensure that banks could make full use of these operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The TLTROs incentivise banks to lend to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As shown in    The red bar measures the take-up of banks that reported that they will use TLTRO funds to substitute market funding sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The blue bar measures the same take-up by banks that intend to use the funds for granting loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The yellow bar reflects take-up by banks that intend to use the funds for purposes other than substituting market funding or granting loans  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The green bar reports the take-up by banks that plan to allocate the funds to more than one purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.59,0)">The bars in the first column to the left measure the outstanding TLTRO III amounts in December 2019 distributed by the responses to the January 2020 BLS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.51,0)">The bars in the second column in the centre measure the outstanding TLTRO III amounts in March 2020 and the amount of bridge LTROs distributed by the responses to the April 2020 BLS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.48,0)">Shaded areas report take-up of banks that change their expected use of funds between survey waves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.27,0)">The cost of monetary policy inaction In assessing the contribution of monetary policy to countering the pandemic shock, a natural benchmark is to calculate the adverse impact that would have materialised had monetary policy not been responsive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">To calculate the alternative path the economy would have taken in the absence of our monetary policy measures, we can construct constellations of financial conditions that would have materialised in the absence of our monetary policy actions, and then feed these counterfactual financial conditions into macroeconomic models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">A first approach to calculating counterfactual financial conditions is to employ pre-pandemic impact estimates of past monetary policy recalibrations in order to calculate by how much higher, say, average yields would have been in the absence of monetary policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.27,0)">Counterfactual analysis by ECB staff based on this approach suggests that, absent our monetary policy measures, euro area output would be 1.3 percentage points lower and the annual inflation rate would be 0.8 percentage points lower by 2022 in cumulative terms  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">It follows that this first approach to quantifying the effects of our policies is likely to underestimate by a wide margin their true effect under the macro-financial conditions generated by the extraordinary pandemic shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.88,0)">A more realistic assumption for constructing counterfactual financial conditions is to recognise that, in the event of policy inaction, financial markets – which were already highly destabilised – would have gone into a tailspin, sending the economy into a meltdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.04,0)">In the type of macroeconomic models that central banks typically use for simulation and policy analysis, it is challenging to reflect the role of monetary policy measures in providing a credible backstop against adverse tail risks – such as an arrest in the flow of credit to the economy and acute financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">However, building on recent advances in the macro-econometrics of estimating the impact of financial tail risks, preliminary results by ECB staff indicate that the ECB’s removal of the financial tail risk associated with the pandemic ensured a degree of support to growth that is several times larger than the impact derived by the more limited calculation shown in    ECB analysis also finds that our measures have been crucial in preserving the flow of credit to the economy and preventing disruptive financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Economic and financial challenges While the recent news on vaccines is very welcome and reduces the likelihood of the most severe scenarios, the current surge in infections and the re-imposition of containment measures serve as warning signals that the recovery path will still be long and fraught with risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.44,0)">Economic developments are likely to be unsteady and uneven across countries and sectors for some time to come and remain subject to elevated uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.21,0)">As        In terms of composition, households in the lower portion of the income distribution have been most affected by the pandemic  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">However, the results of the ECB’s pilot Consumer Expectations Survey   confirm that these households are receiving a higher share of pandemic-related government support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Since, as is shown in   This has led to very high savings rates especially among the higher-income cohorts  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The contribution of currency flows should be considered an upper bound, as a breakdown by holding sector is not available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The latest observation is for October 2020 for deposits, loans and currency in circulation and the second quarter of 2020 for the saving rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.49,0)">In relation to business investment, firms are likely to postpone or cancel some of their capital expenditure plans against a background of heightened uncertainty about future demand for their products, spare capacity and weakened balance sheets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">So far, supportive policies such as loan guarantees and moratoria, together with capital relief provided by supervisory authorities, have also been effective in averting a liquidity crisis, as indicated by the sharp improvement in the quick ratio – a measure of a firm’s ability to meet its short-term obligations with its most liquid assets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">This has also allowed firms to finance working capital and compensate for diminished revenues, which has been fundamental for heading off a wave of insolvencies and permanent damage to productive capacity, as well as protecting jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.6,0)">At the same time, firms have been taking on more debt, as reflected in leverage ratios  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.61,0)">The evidence suggests that firms entering the last financial crisis with a higher leverage ratio experienced a sharper decline in investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.51,0)">This points to the risk that cumulated leverage might weigh on business investment during the post-pandemic recovery phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">It follows that there is a clear lead role for fiscal policy in driving overall demand and addressing sectoral asymmetries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This is even more the case under current conditions, since the effects of decisive and well-targeted fiscal action will likely prove to be stronger than usual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.96,0)">In particular, fiscal transfers in normal times are associated with only-limited effects on output, but these constitute a powerful instrument when granted to liquidity-constrained households or struggling firms in the current environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Moreover, the pursuit of fiscal support for the economy and an accommodative fiscal policy are facilitated by the knowledge that there is light at the end of the tunnel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.9,0)">The risk of an adverse real-financial feedback loop The ruling out of adverse feedback loops between the real economy and financial markets is a central task for policy makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">A tightening in funding costs or worsening liquidity positions have so far been forestalled by the prompt policy reaction, and banks, in turn, have been able and willing to meet the strong demand for liquidity over the course of the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.7,0)">However, there are some worrying signals in recent survey data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.77,0)">The October euro area bank lending survey   reports a broad-based tightening of credit standards that banks attribute primarily to the risks underlying the macroeconomic environment and a deterioration in borrower creditworthiness  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.84,0)">The BLS also shows that the scaling back of investment plans has been an important source of the decline in credit demand in the last quarters  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.0,0)">A similar message is also provided by the latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises in the euro area  : SMEs expect the availability of external and internal sources of finance to deteriorate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.01,0)">The net percentages for responses to questions related to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to a tightening and the percentage reporting that it contributed to an easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.71,0)">“Cost of funds and balance sheet constraints” is the unweighted average of “costs related to capital position”, “access to market financing” and “liquidity position”; “risk perceptions” is the unweighted average of “general economic situation and outlook”, “industry or firm-specific situation and outlook/borrower’s creditworthiness” and “risk related to the collateral demanded”; “competition” is the unweighted average of “competition from other banks”, “competition from non-banks” and “competition from market financing”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.7,0)">The net percentages for the “other factors” refer to further factors which were mentioned by banks as having contributed to changes in credit standards, currently mainly related to the policy interventions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.67,0)">The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2020 for actual credit standards and the fourth quarter of 2020 for expected credit standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.0,0)">The net percentages for responses to questions relating to contributing factors are defined as the difference between the percentage of banks reporting that the given factor contributed to increasing demand and the percentage reporting that it contributed to decreasing demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.44,0)">“Other financing needs” is the unweighted average of “mergers/acquisitions and corporate restructuring” and “debt refinancing/restructuring and renegotiation”; “use of alternative finance” is the unweighted average of “internal financing”, “loans from other banks”, “loans from non-banks”, “issuance/redemption of debt securities” and “issuance/redemption of equity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.38,0)">The latest observation is for the third quarter of 2020 for actual demand and the fourth quarter of 2020 for expected demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.78,0)">In one direction, banks may view the dwindling loan demand as a negative signal about the state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In the other direction, firms may see their concerns about the future prospects for the macroeconomic situation confirmed by a tightening of borrowing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.21,0)">Furthermore, this adverse interaction would be reinforced if household spending were to weaken and thereby were to further dampen firm prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.58,0)">Another type of adverse real-financial feedback loop under pandemic conditions consists of the self-reinforcing nature of a sub-optimal fiscal-financial interaction process by which fiscal policy insufficiently responds to the pandemic shock in fear of triggering an unwarranted tightening of funding conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In a high-multiplier environment, this equilibrium could be self-reinforcing since the associated deterioration in the macro-financial environment could indeed validate an increase in sovereign risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">By contrast, the positive macro-financial impact of a vigorous fiscal response can reconcile the twin phenomena of an increase in fiscal deficits and a decline in sovereign yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It therefore remains vital for fiscal and monetary policymakers to guard against the risks of these financial amplification channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Ensuring favourable financing conditions At our October monetary policy meeting, we announced that, on the basis of a thorough assessment of the economic outlook and the balance of risks surrounding it, we will recalibrate our instruments, as appropriate, to respond to the unfolding situation and to ensure that financing conditions remain favourable to support the economic recovery and counteract the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">Ensuring favourable financing conditions to support the economic recovery and counteract the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path is essential for several reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">First, the commitment by the central bank to ensure favourable financing conditions supports confidence levels among consumers, firms, financial intermediaries and governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Second, this commitment also reduces the likelihood of the materialisation of the adverse real-financial doom loops outlined above.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.11,0)">In particular, the emergence of self-fulfilling trajectories by which borrowers and lenders pull back in fear of a tightening of financial conditions is less likely if it is commonly understood that market disruptions will trigger central bank intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Third, since it is clear that considerable fiscal support   remains necessary for as long as the pandemic limits the normal operation of the economy and in order to underpin the post-pandemic recovery phase, monetary policy must act both to facilitate the necessarily-expansive fiscal stance and to minimise the crowding-out of private sector activity that would occur if high levels of public borrowing were transmitted to an increase in sovereign yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.43,0)">Fourth, while the arrival in the coming weeks and months of further positive signals about progress in the rollout of vaccine treatments would certainly be highly welcome, these “news shocks” might be more quickly absorbed by financial markets than by households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.57,0)">Accordingly, it is essential that the macroeconomic recovery is not derailed by a premature steepening of the yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Finally, ensuring favourable financial conditions is central to restoring inflation momentum and ensuring that inflation expectations are guided by the commitment of the central bank to counter the negative pandemic shock to the inflation process and secure convergence towards the inflation aim over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.79,0)">The pandemic has resulted in disinflationary pressures, with the downward impact of greater economic slack outweighing any inflationary pressures from supply constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.31,0)">In the chart, this negative shock to the inflation outlook is represented by the downward shift in the expected path of inflation from “A” to “B”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The “BE” path   illustrates a transition path of inflation that is even lower than originally envisaged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">By providing additional monetary policy accommodation, the central bank can aim towards the upper region of the “BCDE” zone, so that the adjustment is closer to the “BCD” path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.38,0)">Tolerating a longer phase of even lower inflation   than originally envisaged would be costly and risky.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.04,0)">First, it would imply a weaker recovery of consumption and investment, as a result of higher expected real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.15,0)">Second, it would contribute to a downward drift in inflation expectations that might become entrenched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.77,0)">The risk to inflation expectations is especially relevant in the context of the euro area, since inflation has already been below target for a prolonged period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">In this context, it is essential that inflation expectations are anchored by the commitment of the central bank to offset the negative pandemic shock to the inflation path and ensure convergence to the inflation aim over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Under these conditions, the first challenge in delivering the medium-term inflation aim is to reconnect inflation to its pre-pandemic projected path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This means boosting inflation momentum towards the upper part of the “BCDE” area  , so that the adjustment approaches the “BCD” path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">By setting the monetary stance at the appropriate level to deliver the financial conditions required to offset the pandemic shock to inflation, the underlying inflation trajectory will be restored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">In turn, this also serves to underpin the formation of inflation expectations in a manner that is consistent with meeting the medium-term inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Looking beyond the immediate task, even once the disinflationary pressures caused by the pandemic have been sufficiently offset, the second challenge will be to ensure that the post-pandemic monetary policy stance will deliver the timely and robust convergence of inflation to our medium-term aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In this context, our in-progress strategy review will help to shape the future course of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.14,0)">Conclusion The pandemic constitutes a multi-phase challenge for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.44,0)">In the initial weeks of the pandemic in spring 2020, the top priority was clearly to stabilise markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">With the ongoing interruptions to economic activity throughout 2020 and running into 2021, monetary policy continues to have a clear role to play in ensuring the preservation of favourable financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This will remain an essential priority even in the post-pandemic phase, given that the macroeconomic hit from the pandemic is likely to persist even after medical solutions have been rolled out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Only by ensuring appropriately-favourable financial conditions will the full economic recovery be assured and, by countering the negative impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path, will robust convergence to our medium-term inflation aim be copperfastened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">I am grateful to Krzysztof Bankowski, Giacomo Carboni, Maarten Dossche, Marien Ferdinandusse,
