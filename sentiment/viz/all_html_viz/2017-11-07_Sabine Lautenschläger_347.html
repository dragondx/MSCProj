    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.66,0)"> European banks – The quest for the best business model Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, ECB Forum on Banking Supervision, Frankfurt, 7 November 2017 The banking sector is going through tough times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Having emerged from a major crisis, it faces challenges and change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.01,0)">But one thing has not changed, and it never will.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">A bank needs a sustainable business model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It has to earn revenues; it has to keep its costs in check; and it has to keep its risks under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.49,0)">How all this is done has changed, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.27,0)">Many things that still worked a couple of years ago no longer work today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me quickly highlight a few points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.69,0)">Profitability is low for many banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.19,0)">First, for a long time, economic growth was low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.39,0)">Together with low interest rates, that has put a brake on a traditional source of revenue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Banks, in particular those that have not found a profitable market niche, need to diversify their sources of revenue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Digitalisation might offer a solution, but it is certainly not the only one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.48,0)">Second, some national banking markets in Europe are overbanked and therefore overly competitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">So there is a need for consolidation – consolidation which leads to stronger banks with viable business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.08,0)">Third, many banks still have high costs, partly because of their large branch networks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But how large do these networks actually need to be in this age of digital banking?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.62,0)">Fourth, some banks are still weighed down by impaired balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.23,0)">They need to get rid of legacy assets such as non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Fifth, some banks could improve the way they handle risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">They need to establish a strong risk culture, set up adequate risk governance and integrate it into their overall structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And finally, all banks have to adapt to more stringent rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">It is true that they come at a cost, but in the long run, their benefits are greater.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Society benefits in any case, but so do the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Strong rules help to win people’s trust, and that is an important asset for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">A few banks still have some way to go – they still need to adapt their business models; they need to find their competitive advantage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Those banks which want to prosper in the future need to act now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">And it is indeed possible to prosper, even in tough times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Across the euro area, we see about two dozen large banks which constantly outperform their peers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.49,0)">They are based in different countries, they are of different sizes, and they have different business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">So it is not about a single successful business model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.35,0)">It is about the whole set-up of how to do banking today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">And, as these banks show, it is possible to succeed – that is encouraging, for us and for the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">These are challenging times for banks; there is no doubt about that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">One thing is clear, though: tomorrow’s business models will look different from today’s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.21,0)">But hasn’t that always been true?</span>
