    <span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)"> Independence and accountability in a changing world Introductory remarks by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Transparency International EU Event “Two sides of the same coin?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Independence and accountability of the European Central Bank”, Brussels, 28 March 2017 General considerations Thank you for your invitation to today’s event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">I am looking forward to a discussion with a panel representing such a wide range of stakeholders and views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The ECB fully shares the values that underpin Transparency International’s work, such as integrity and accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">At a time when many people are expressing doubts about public institutions, it is clear that these principles are vital for their legitimacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">And we are convinced that greater responsibility and integration at euro area level, which are much needed to strengthen our Economic and Monetary Union, should go hand in hand with greater democratic accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">So Transparency International’s work regarding the EU’s economic governance is certainly useful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">This is why the ECB has facilitated this project by inviting the researchers to a series of meetings with senior staff.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">We were offered the opportunity to comment on the draft of the report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But as the study and its recommendations are entirely owned by Transparency International, we exclusively provided factual observations and abstained from commenting on the substance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Before offering some observations on the four chapters of the report – independence, transparency, accountability and integrity – I would like to make two preliminary, more general remarks: First, and to answer the question raised in the title of the report: yes, for the ECB independence and accountability are two sides of the same coin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The ECB was given a democratic mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Independence ensures that the ECB can act in line with its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Accountability, on the other hand, ensures that the ECB does act in line with its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">This can be measured ex post against outcomes – the ECB did indeed take decisive action to preserve price stability during the crisis  – and it relies ex ante on having a strong accountability framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Second, the ECB is quite unique in the EU institutional context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I understand that Transparency International has published similar reports on the European Investment Bank and the European Stability Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There are important differences between the three bodies – not only as regards their mandate and purpose, but also in terms of their institutional setup, governance structures, funding and, in this context more importantly, accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Of course, we are an EU institution  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But we are also a central bank and, as of 2014, a banking supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">These specific tasks require a dedicated governance framework considered so crucial by the EU legislators that it was laid down in the EU Treaty and, as regards banking supervision, in the regulation establishing the Single Supervisory Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In my remarks I will cover each aspect of the report briefly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Independence In the European Union, the principle of central bank independence has a quasi-constitutional basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.9,0)">Article 108 of the Treaty establishing the European Community states that: “neither the ECB, nor a national central bank … shall seek or take instructions from Community institutions or bodies, from any government of a Member State or from any other body”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.63,0)">Looking at the debate around independence, which is also taking place outside the EU, it becomes clear that safeguarding our independence requires more than a series of legal provisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.8,0)">It requires an explanation of why independence is important for a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">As guardians of price stability in the euro area, the ECB creates the foundation for a healthy and stable European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Independence is essential in that respect, as it protects the ECB from any temptation by governments to seek changes in monetary policy to favour short-term economic gains over price stability, or to pander to private interest groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is equally important to correct misperceptions, and all stakeholders do have a responsibility in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The ECB communicates clear conditions for accepting credit institutions as counterparts, for quality of collateral, for emergency liquidity assistance extended by national central banks so as not to interfere with monetary policy, for accepting securities under its asset purchase programme, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">These conditions are transparent and equal for all counterparties in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Therefore, the ECB does not aim for political buy in, it merely clarifies the conditions which govern its monetary policy for all euro area countries, and this is needed to ensure that it stays within its mandate and, thus, to safeguard its independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As for the ECB’s current role in the macroeconomic adjustment programmes, this is enshrined in a legal framework  that is not for the ECB to alter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We believe that financial issues are where the ECB’s advice is of particular relevance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">If there were political willingness to change the framework, we would be happy to engage and, based on our experience, help clarify how best to support the other institutions while safeguarding our independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.89,0)">Accountability Independence does not mean arbitrariness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The ECB was given a democratic mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is held accountable for acting in line with this mandate, both democratically and legally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">From a democratic perspective, the ECB is accountable for its policies to the representation of EU citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.79,0)">As described in the Report, the ECB’s President participates in quarterly hearings of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.38,0)">As MEP Tremosa i Balcells knows very well, these are not “dialogues de sourds”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.56,0)">The MEPs do not shy away from asking critical questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">As the President emphasised at his September 2016 hearing, the ECB takes these exchanges very seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In addition to the regular quarterly hearings, my Executive Board colleagues and I also participate in hearings of this Committee to explain the ECB’s reasoning and decisions on specific topics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Just last year, I visited the European Parliament twice to discuss the proposal for a euro area budgetary capacity and the ECB’s involvement in Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.4,0)">In about ten days’ time the ECB, as it does every year, will publish its Annual Report and the Vice-President will present it before the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Later in the year, the President will also attend the plenary debate on it, which precedes the Parliament adopting its official position on our activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This European Parliament Resolution is an important contribution for our work, as it summarises the views of the representatives of the European people on our actions and policies, also in the fields of independence, transparency, accountability and integrity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We take the European Parliament’s comments and suggestions very seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I could continue with other examples showing the health of the relationship between the European Parliament and the ECB: from the Governing Council decision to adopt principles that increase transparency in developing ECB regulations on European statistics, to the ECB’s readiness to discuss questions on the work it is engaged in in the Basel Committee, of course within the confines imposed by confidentiality requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And I could mention the separate accountability channels foreseen with the establishment of ECB Banking Supervision, based on the Interinstitutional Agreement   between the European Parliament and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.34,0)">Last week, the Chair of the ECB Supervisory Board was at the European Parliament to present the ECB Annual Report on supervisory activities 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Of course, I leave it to MEP Tremosa i Balcells to express the Parliament’s judgement on the robustness of our accountability framework towards the Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">From the ECB’s perspective, our accountability framework as defined in the Treaty is working well, and has been adapted to the challenges we have faced in recent years by expanding our interactions where and when necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Transparency Transparency is crucial to the ECB’s work and it attaches great importance to communicating effectively with the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Transparency helps people understand the ECB’s monetary policy, and better public understanding, in turn, makes the ECB’s monetary policy more credible and effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Against this background, communication with financial market participants deserves particular attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I see it as a double-edged sword.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.42,0)">Clear communication with financial markets enhances the implementation and transmission of monetary policy, but on the other hand it may risk central banks being captured by private interests, or worse, disclosing privileged information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.15,0)">And even the perception of such risks would be harmful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Please allow me to present some examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The European Central Bank has made significant progress on matters of transparency and good governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">This was noted by the European Ombudsman, who commended the ECB for adopting the “Guiding principles for external communication by members of the Executive Board” and “encourage  it to lead the field on all aspects of good governance”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The Ombudsman more generally acknowledged, when presenting her Annual Report for 2015 to the European Parliament, that the ECB has “boosted its transparency”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The Guiding Principles provide a more concrete and very practical expression of the rules that are already binding on Executive Board members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">They enshrine the ECB’s approach to ensuring that financial market-sensitive information is not disclosed to select groups and avoiding giving the impression that an event organiser has a “prestige advantage” allowing it to benefit financially from the perception of exclusive contacts with the members of the Executive Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The Guiding Principles also advise the Executive Board members to include, as a matter of principle, an ECB staff member in bilateral meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These principles have also been subscribed to by the Chair of the ECB’s Supervisory Board and the other ECB Representatives to the Supervisory Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.73,0)">In addition, the members of the Governing Council   observe a “quiet period” before monetary policy meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.39,0)">This means they avoid making comments or attending meetings that could influence expectations about monetary policy decisions in the seven days before a scheduled meeting on this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This also covers meetings with the media, market participants or any other outside parties with interests in monetary policy matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.32,0)">As you probably know, the Executive Board Members – including myself – as well as the Chair of the Supervisory Board have been publishing their diaries since November 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I find that the diaries provide a very comprehensive overview of our interactions with external parties; they cover all our professional meetings with the private and public sectors  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">No other EU institution – including via the Transparency Register – or central bank provides such extensive information in terms of transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The ECB has also established high-level fora such as the Institutional Investor Dialogue and the Banking Industry Dialogue to collect relevant market intelligence from stakeholders in a transparent way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">These fora are underpinned by a published charter that sets out the participation rules; the agendas and meeting summaries are also published.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This makes the ECB’s interactions in terms of gathering information from stakeholders highly transparent for the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.83,0)">Since January 2015 the ECB has also been publishing regular accounts of the Governing Council’s monetary policy discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.17,0)">They contain an overview of financial market, economic and monetary developments, followed by a summary of the discussion, in an unattributed form, on the economic and monetary analyses and on the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In doing so, we aim to provide the rationale behind monetary policy decisions and enable anyone who is interested to read the Governing Council’s assessment of the economy within a short period of time after the discussion takes place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Integrity However, independence, accountability and transparency are not enough if they are not flanked by a robust integrity system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Or as Mario Draghi put it in an address to staff: a stronger business culture has to be complemented by a stronger ethical culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">An enhanced ECB Ethics Framework applicable to all staff members became effective in January 2015, and a dedicated Compliance and Governance Office was established to implement this new framework, among other tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Mandatory ethics training for all staff members should further enhance our strong ethical culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Moreover, a high-level Ethics Committee has been established to advise Governing Council, Executive Board and Supervisory Board members on conduct matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In my view the ECB’s Ethics Framework is probably the strictest of any EU institution or central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">All our staff members – including Executive Board members – need to provide a list of their bank accounts and powers of attorney conferred on them by third parties, to facilitate regular compliance checks of their private financial transactions by our external auditor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">While we are convinced of the robustness of our Ethics Framework, such frameworks must, of course, be regularly reviewed against international best practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.39,0)">The review of our whistleblowing regime is just one example in that regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Concluding remarks Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">While we certainly have to strive constantly for improvements, I believe one has to admit that the ECB has made tremendous efforts and indeed made significant progress in strengthening its accountability, boosting its transparency and further enhancing its integrity mechanisms and good governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The ECB is, and has always been, open to a balanced dialogue with stakeholders, including the general public, and strives to keep up to date with fast-evolving communication practices, such as Q&A sessions on Twitter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">This study, containing interviews of ECB senior managers and the report by Transparency International, is indeed a good example of how the ECB engages in a balanced dialogue with diverse representatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">As mentioned earlier, we are convinced that independence requires accountability, and that accountability requires transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Integrity is a foundation of any good administration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We are confident about what we have achieved, but as central bankers we are always “vigilant” and never complacent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Thank you for listening, and I look forward to hearing your views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">A more detailed discussion of the measures taken during the crisis can be found in B. Cœuré, “Consolidating the euro area’s economic recovery”, Introductory remarks prior to an informal exchange of views with the European Affairs Committee and the Finance Committee of the National Assembly, Paris, 13 May 2015; and “Outlook for monetary policy in the euro area”, Speech at Association d’Économie Financière, Paris, 2 February 2017  Namely, the “two-pack” regulation   472/2013) and the Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Cœuré, “Strengthening the Greek financial system”, Introductory remarks at a public hearing at the European Parliament, Brussels, 12 October 2016  This is also why in ten days’ time, alongside the publication of the Annual Report and as requested by the European Parliament, we will publish our feedback on the European Parliament Resolution, which last year was prepared by MEP Tremosa i Balcells.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Emily O’Reilly</span>
