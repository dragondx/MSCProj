    <span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)"> Efficiency in financial institutions Speech by Professor Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the World Congress of Savings Banks, Madrid, 23 May 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, This session of the conference is devoted to the issue of efficiency in financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.19,0)">The very first question which springs to mind in this context is whether banks are efficient institutions and whether they are carrying out functions which in today's world might be considered obsolete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Over a year ago, the Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association, one of the most prestigious economic conferences held every year, discussed the issue of whether banks would still exist in 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.35,0)">I do not think that this is a question which would have arisen quite so prominently at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Banks have played a much more important role in Europe over the past 50 years than they have in the United States, and while the world is obviously a place of change, there is little reason to expect that banks will disappear by 2020 in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I should add that most of the participants at this conference did not expect that to happen in the United States either, but the general consensus was that the nature of banking would definitely be subject to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In a rapidly changing environment, banks as institutions have been around for an incredibly long time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.34,0)">There are any number of different conjectures about the origins of banks, and there is a whole host of economic theories on the rationale for having them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Some of these theories centre on banks being trustworthy enough to provide customers with liquidity and a safe investment haven.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Others focus on the expertise of banks in monitoring credit developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Maintaining that trustworthiness and being at the leading edge in terms of assessing and monitoring risks are to my mind two key competencies that apply to banks and most other sectors of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will come back to the role of banks and the issue of trust after discussing some of the more general features of the lending relationship and current trends in the European financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The importance of banks and relationship lending Despite the amalgamation of institutions, the financial system is composed of a number of financial markets, instruments and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Although the view among leading economists is not unanimous, several economic studies suggest the existence of a link between the sophistication of the financial system and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">As Ross Levine claims "  the weight of evidence suggests that financial systems are a fundamental feature of the process of economic development and that a satisfactory understanding of the factors underlying economic growth requires a greater understanding of the evolution and structure of financial systems  ".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.21,0)">There is a long-standing debate in academic and policy-maker circles on the relative merits and drawbacks of bank versus market financing of economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Whilst in periods of financial market turbulence, there is no doubt that the role played by banks in terms of acquiring expertise on the creditworthiness of their customers and developing close links with firms' management most certainly has its advantages with regard to maintaining financial stability, I do subscribe to the commonly held view that a financial system with a broad range of products and suppliers of services is the best way of meeting the diverse needs of the customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Relationship lending is the term used to describe special agreements made between banks and their customers with regard to credit availability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Banks have the opportunity to closely monitor the customers' creditworthiness, which normally means that liquidity is provided more readily, as relationship lending overcomes some of the information asymmetries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.87,0)">At the microeconomic level, relationship lending tends to insulate firms from financial shocks, as they can rely on previously arranged credit agreements, and the adjustment of retail rates to monetary policy changes is not normally instantaneous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The macroeconomic implication is that relationship lending contributes to smoother business cycle fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.32,0)">Indeed, those fluctuations have been historically more pronounced in the United States and the United Kingdom, where relationship lending is less widespread than in continental Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.98,0)">Relationship lending is not always the best financing choice for firms at any given point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">When assessing a firm's borrowing needs, the bank will need to consider not only the firm's current liquidity supply, but also its long-term ability to repay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It will also take into account a number of non-contractual levers the bank could use to extract repayment  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.86,0)">The interest rate charged is normally renegotiated over time and may not fully reflect the intrinsic risk of the investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In a direct, market-financed lending relationship, firms have access to a wider circle of potential lenders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The interest rate is a competitive one compensating the lender for the risk associated with that particular loan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Because it is based on the dissemination of more widespread information, direct financing via the market implies more fixed costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Thus it is likely that larger firms will take advantage of this form of financing more than smaller firms, and that firms in general drift towards capital markets during more prosperous cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Innovative firms embarking on new areas of technology have a better chance of obtaining financial assistance in a system based on the broad availability of public information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.49,0)">At the moment, the absence of a well-developed stock market is a disadvantage to any type of economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Equity, as a means of financing, is essential for the emergence and growth of innovative firms, as banks may be reluctant to provide these firms with loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Overall, I believe that economies characterised by both a well-established banking sector and capital markets have a distinct advantage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Furthermore, in times of crises in either of these sectors, the other sector can be used as a prop to counterbalance any negative effects, acting as the "spare tyre" if you like.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Characteristics of the European financial system Let me turn briefly to the most prominent characteristics of the euro area financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Relationship lending plays a prominent role in Europe, particularly in financing small and medium-sized enterprises  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.49,0)">Given that euro area economies are widely dominated by such enterprises, a decline in the availability of relationship lending would likely have a significant impact on the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">A wave of consolidation has taken place in the euro area banking sector over the past few years  , "Report on financial structures").</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.37,0)">The number of credit institutions has declined, primarily as a result of mergers between smaller institutions at both regional and national levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">At the same time, these mergers have often given rise to bigger non-specialised universal banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.06,0)">Partly as a result of this wave of consolidation in recent years, the number of branches and employees working in credit institutions in the euro area has dropped significantly in some countries and in some specific categories, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.7,0)">savings banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.68,0)">The integration of cross-border banking services, in particular at the retail level, remains limited and restricted to a few countries in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The handful of larger institutions that provide their services throughout the euro area mainly serves larger corporate customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">This is quite natural as information asymmetries are more pronounced with regard to retail customers, and it is in this field that domestic players continue to play an important role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The euro area financial system has been subject to change over the past few years even outside the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.58,0)">Traditional deposit-taking activities have been challenged by the emergence of asset management companies and predominantly mutual and pension funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Households and corporations have directed savings and surplus funds in the economy increasingly towards these new players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">This suggests that the intermediation process in the euro area is undergoing significant change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">It should be noted, however, that life insurance companies and investment funds are often located within banking conglomerates, suggesting that new developments are also taking place in the banking business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The origin of savings banks The idea of trust has been at the core of the business of savings banks since the very beginning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Mutual savings banks, which originated in the United Kingdom in the first part of the nineteenth century and progressively spread throughout the United States, were conceived as philanthropic institutions designed to relieve pauperism by "inducing habits of economy" in the working classes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.85,0)">The first mutual savings banks were associated with charitable organisations managed by wealthy philanthropists endeavouring on such projects in their spare time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Similar institutions soon began to develop in continental Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.52,0)">The German Sparkassen, for example, which began to spread after the Napoleonic wars, were private institutions or entities owned and controlled by the government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.46,0)">An important feature of these banks was that liability for these deposits was either assumed by the owners   or by the government  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The safety of deposit was crucial to their mission as savings banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Only firm assurance that their savings were safe would encourage the poor to entrust them to a financial intermediary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.56,0)">Furthermore, in order to limit potential liabilities, savings banks were usually limited in the type of assets they could hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.19,0)">Research on savings banks has always been somewhat limited, as their role has never been considered terribly important for industrial lending and, ultimately, for economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">By contrast, universal banks — defined as institutions offering a full range of financial services under one corporate roof — are generally attributed with a leading role in the development of industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">However, savings banks did in fact play a very important role in the development of industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In Germany, for example, they financed many public infrastructure projects and facilitated the large urban agglomeration resulting from industrialisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The transformation of savings banks from small specialised financial intermediaries into large institutions offering a broad range of services is perhaps one of the most striking innovations of the twentieth century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Banks and trust Let me now turn to two aspects, which are fundamental for sound money and credit, and they are credibility and trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">One of the main characteristics of banks has always been their role as a trustworthy provider of liquidity and safe investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.32,0)">In the early days of banking, there were plenty of examples of governments' lack of respect for the private property of its citizens, not least bank deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.92,0)">In 1345, a number of bankers in Barcelona were actually executed by the municipal authorities, in spite of the fact that their failures primarily resulted from forced loans to the city.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Executing these bankers was a convenient way of avoiding repayment of these loans and for improving public finances  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Some even claim that converting the cash originating from deposits to loans was a convenient way of limiting the scope for the government to confiscate banks' assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.97,0)">Thus banks reacted to the fear of the government abusing its power by creating the dual characteristics of banks as we define them today, as takers of deposits and lenders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.82,0)">Central banks have also had a turbulent relationship with governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Many central banks were founded by governments who wanted to enjoy the financial advantages they felt could be obtained from such banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.17,0)">Some government-sponsored central banks were established to restore the value of the national currency, usually after the government had already destroyed its value as a result of over-issuance during wartimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.78,0)">Often the financing of governments led to excess printing of money and subsequent inflation, which eroded the value of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.41,0)">For the private citizen, inflation was yet another way of confiscating its property.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.45,0)">People who have been cheated tend to learn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.66,0)">If deposits are confiscated or the value of money is destroyed, people stop holding deposits and money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.75,0)">Instead they search for other assets that have some of the same properties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.01,0)">This in itself tends to push up inflation and invalidate the intermediation process of the financial system, which is crucial for financing investments and creating growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.2,0)">Furthermore, these other assets are in many ways inferior in terms of their value as a means of transaction, store of value and unit of account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.24,0)">In addition, they are not normally easily accessible to the ordinary man on the street.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Some may say that these issues were relevant many years ago, but not today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.27,0)">But, if we look at recent events in one particular Spanish speaking country, we see at least one example of how a government, through excessive recourse to financing from its banking system, has destroyed the confidence of its citizens, resulting in the disintegration of the economy and a sharp rise in poverty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.59,0)">It does not take much to lose credibility, but it takes decades to rebuild it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">When the ECB was established in 1998, this was clearly a central issue, although to some extent we were able to draw on the credibility established by our predecessors, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.95,0)">the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">However, the founding fathers of European Economic and Monetary Union wisely included provisions in the Treaty which would help to create confidence in the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">A clear mandate with priority given to maintaining price stability and independence in its decisions are fundamental elements of the statute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">The Stability and Growth Pact should also be regarded as a factor contributing to trust and credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">History shows us that we should be very careful about treating such issues lightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.21,0)">Short-term gains can easily end up being futile against the efforts needed to re-establish the lost confidence of the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As argued in another speech some time ago "Ultimately, trust must be earned, it is granted temporarily, it must be checked and it must be backed up by hard evidence, not be based purely on faith or belief  ."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Concluding remarks Sound central banking, but also banking in general and the business of savings banks in particular, must be based on long-term objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">In this context, the monetary policy strategy of the European Central Bank, with a clear commitment to price stability, helps to reduce uncertainty and thus makes it easier for people to make long-term decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">While we may all be tempted, at one point or another, to settle for short-term gains, we must not forget that we all rely heavily on the general public's trust in us and given the focus of the business you are in, you have a particular interest in us maintaining confidence in the long-term stability of the euro.</span>
