    <span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)"> European banking supervision – towards a common culture Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at The Eurofi Financial Forum 2018, Vienna, 6 September 2018 Since 2014, we have made huge steps towards establishing a truly European system of banking supervision and embracing a common supervisory culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.94,0)">Does this mean nothing more needs to be done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.45,0)">Not quite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">For a fully-fledged common culture you need to have three things: First, you need a truly unified legal basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.69,0)">You simply cannot build a comprehensive common supervisory culture if you have to apply a different set of rules in each of the 19 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Just think how we need to treat fit and proper assessments differently from one country to the next.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Second, you need harmonised administrative practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">And here, we have made good progress in the last four years – wherever the legislator granted us scope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We established practices for all the major areas of supervision, such as the SREP, the treatment of NPLs, stress tests, the ICAAP, the ILAAP, and so on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Third, you need time and cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">After all, staff from 19 countries and 26 authorities have to be persuaded to leave their cultural comfort zone and align how they think, assess and act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.82,0)">I measure how far we have come by the frequency with which banks ask about changes in supervisory actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.73,0)">In other words: how often do banks complain about changes in the way they are being supervised?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.73,0)">They complain a great deal, I can tell you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">And we keep pushing forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Let me give you just a few examples: We strive to increase the number of cross-border on-site missions, with even more on-site supervisors working on banks outside their home country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The success of this initiative will largely depend on the number of on-site supervisors the national authorities are willing to send.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We have established a rotation scheme for members of our Joint Supervisory Teams.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This too will help to spread a common culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At the same time, it helps to avoid supervisory capture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">We foster exchange between supervisors from across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We bring them together in many different working groups to devise training manuals and supervisory guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But the ECB cannot create a common supervisory culture by itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The national authorities can and should contribute, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I understand, of course, that it is difficult to let go of traditions that have been honed over decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.49,0)">Culture is a sticky thing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">But national authorities should embrace the European idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">And they should seize the opportunity to contribute to a new, common supervisory culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">They should let more of their staff come to the ECB, for a while at least.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Let them work in a European environment and carry this culture back to their home countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And the idea of a European supervisory culture should be reflected in how we deal with banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For example, national reporting requirements should be dropped; instead, we should aim for a single European reporting framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">To sum up: a common supervisory culture is emerging, but it still needs to be nurtured and nudged.</span>
