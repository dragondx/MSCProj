    <h1> Hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament </h1>
    <h2> Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, in accordance with Article 113(3) of the Treaty on European Union, Brussels, 5 March 2001 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)"> Hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, in accordance with Article 113  of the Treaty on European Union, Brussels, 5 March 2001 With the transcript of the questions and answers Chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath   I'd like to welcome Mr Duisenberg to the first Monetary Dialogue this year, under the strict conditions that Mr Duisenberg only has 15 minutes for his introduction, so that we can use the time until 5 o'clock for questions and answers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">I'd like to point out too that we have got the promised Christmas present from the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.36,0)">In the December report there was a sort of inflation forecast made to us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This present had the problem of giving us something with one hand while at the same time taking something away with the other, but that's presumably how we'll arrive at more transparency in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The President of the ECB, I'm sure, will be able to say something about that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">On the question of the econometric models, we'll be able to work if we have the bases of the decisions of the European Central Bank made better clear to you to demand steps or to criticise them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">President, you have the floor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Introductory statement delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Thank you very much, Madam Chairman.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I shall try to stick to your discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">I am happy to be here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The last time was 23rd of November last year and, as usual, I shall try to present first the ECB's analysis of recent economic developments and its assessment of the prospects in the euro area, that is focussing on how to foster the continuation of non-inflationary growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Then I shall report to you on several important decisions taken by the governing council with regard to the introduction of euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">But before I start, I don't want to let this opportunity pass without also, in this forum and on this occasion, saying a word of welcome to the newest member of the euro area, namely Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">By adopting the single currency on the first of January this year, Greece has become the 12th member of the euro area, sharing the rights, but also the obligations, of the other member states, which already have adopted or had adopted the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Economic and monetary developments Since the last hearing before this Committee on 23 November 2000 the Governing Council of the ECB has decided to keep the ECB's main interest rates unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">This was because, overall, recent developments have pointed towards more balanced risks to price stability than the ones prevailing at the time of our last meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">However, some factors still argue for caution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Allow me to comment in more detail on the Governing Council's assessment of the current economic situation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I should like to start with the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">On 14 December 2000, the Governing Council decided to confirm the existing reference value for monetary growth, namely an annual growth rate of 4 1/2% for the broad monetary aggregate M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.28,0)">This decision was taken on the grounds that the evidence continues to support the assumptions underlying the derivation of the first reference value in December 1998  , namely those for trend potential output growth and the trend decline in M3 income velocity in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Turning to recent monetary developments, there were already indications in November 2000 that a moderation in monetary growth had been under way for some months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">In late 2000 and early 2001, these signs of moderation became stronger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">According to the latest available data, the three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3 in the months from November 2000 to January 2001 was 5%, gradually moving into the direction of the reference value of 4 1/2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">All in all, the risks to price stability from the monetary side have become increasingly balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.23,0)">As regards the second pillar, since my last appearance before this Committee, several developments have changed somewhat the prospects of economic growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.94,0)">On the one hand, the slowdown in the US economy and developments in Japan have increased the uncertainty surrounding the prospects for world growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">On the other hand, the fall in oil prices should have positive income effects in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.54,0)">All the information available shows that euro area real GDP growth declined slightly in the second half of last year compared with the strong growth recorded in the first half.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">However, the general outlook for this year and the next remains positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Economic activity in the euro area is mainly determined by domestic factors such as long-term financing costs and disposable income developments, which have remained favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In addition, the euro area's high rates of capacity utilisation, the ongoing growth in employment and continued declines in unemployment should help to maintain solid growth in private investment and consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">All in all, the overall level of confidence in the euro area has remained high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Economic indicators relating to developments around the turn of the year support the view that economic growth will remain fairly robust for the period ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.44,0)">Although the more moderate prospects for world growth might end up being associated with a certain slowdown in euro area exports, at present there are no convincing signs that the slowdown in the US economy is having significant and lasting spill-over effects on the euro area economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Nevertheless, a close monitoring of global developments is warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.14,0)">As regards recent price developments, the annual rate of increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   in January 2001 was 2.4%, as published by Eurostat, 0.2 percentage points lower than in December 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Since November 2000, developments in oil prices and the exchange rate of the euro have contributed to lower short-term inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In January, the rate of increase in energy prices continued to decline, but other HICP components, notably unprocessed food and services prices, rose significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.21,0)">As developments in oil prices and the foreign exchange rate in January and February 2001 have been subject to some volatility, caution should be exercised when assessing their likely impact on HICP inflation in the short-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Moreover, indirect effects of past oil price increases and euro depreciation are still coming through as witnessed by the continued rise in producer price increases for consumer goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.31,0)">Other short-term factors, such as increases in indirect taxation or in administered prices, may also prevent consumer price inflation from falling rapidly below 2% over the next few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.16,0)">I should also like to emphasise that market participants consider the current level of consumer price inflation as temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Bond yields in the euro area indicate that the general expectation is for inflation to be within the ECB's definition of price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">The ECB is committed to fulfil this expectation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The current uncertainty regarding the prospects for world economic growth heightens the need to maintain the foundations for strong non-inflationary growth in the euro area as well as to strengthen the potential of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The ECB shares the objective of the governments and citizens of the euro area of a growing prosperity in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">By focusing on the maintenance of price stability over the medium term, the ECB is making an essential contribution to the achievement of this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">At the same time, it is of paramount importance that all policy actors help to maintain the current favourable outlook for growth and inflation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">First, it is crucial that social partners continue the process of wage moderation seen in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">This will not only facilitate the task of monetary policy, but will also contribute to continuing the process of reducing unemployment in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In addition, long-term growth perspectives for the euro area will benefit if governments intensify their efforts to progress along the path of fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I consider that budgetary plans recently expressed in countries' updated stability programmes are not very ambitious as tax cuts are not accompanied by appropriate expenditure restraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.51,0)">If the macroeconomic environment remains as favourable as expected, the envisaged fiscal policy stance could add to demand pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.46,0)">Fiscal policy could, thus, become an additional source of upward risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.71,0)">In addition, the stability programmes do not make the necessary progress in addressing long-term fiscal challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.68,0)">These challenges include, inter alia, the budgetary adjustments needed in many countries to cope with population ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">More efforts are also needed in the ongoing process of implementing structural reforms to foster the growth potential of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">This is of crucial importance to promote the supply of labour and capital and to innovate and disseminate new technologies and production methods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">More flexibility in labour markets and reforms aimed at enhancing labour force participation are needed to offset the low growth in the working age population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Additional measures that are needed are the removal of barriers to investment and the creation of the institutional structures needed for a rapid and efficient adoption of new technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In this respect, the Governing Council considers that there is no clear indication yet that these structural factors have led to a measurable and lasting increase in productivity growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.58,0)">This notwithstanding, the uncertainties surrounding estimates of the medium-term development of potential output growth in the euro area have become skewed to the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This being the case the Governing Council will carefully monitor further evidence of an acceleration of productivity growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The ECB's monetary policy would naturally take such changes appropriately into account, if and when they occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Issues relating to the introduction of euro banknotes and coins I should now like to report on several decisions that have been taken by the Governing Council of the ECB with regard to the euro cash changeover on 1 January 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Given the crucial importance of this matter and the responsibility of the Eurosystem as a whole to achieve a smooth cash changeover, the Governing Council has adopted an ECB Guideline on the 2002 cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The aim of this Guideline is to ensure that the framework of the changeover is consistently implemented, such as the provisions for frontloading and sub-frontloading and the financial modalities for credit institutions, as well as to provide a level playing-field for all credit institutions, their agents and sub-frontloaded entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The ECB Guideline can be viewed on the ECB's website   and has also been published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Moreover, the Governing Council considered measures which should help to ensure the availability of euro banknotes in non-euro area countries, so that customers demanding euro banknotes are able to obtain them in a timely and efficient manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">This is particularly relevant for countries in eastern and south-eastern Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For example, a significant amount of Deutsche Mark-denominated banknotes are estimated to be held in these countries, and also some other euro area currencies are held outside their national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Therefore, the Governing Council agreed on the following principles regarding the distribution of frontloaded euro banknotes outside the euro area: credit institutions which are counterparties for monetary policy operations within the Eurosystem will be allowed to distribute frontloaded euro banknotes to their branches, or headquarters, as appropriate, located outside the euro area; credit institutions with their main place of business inside the euro area will be allowed to sub-frontload euro banknotes to their subsidiaries that are also credit institutions and are located outside the euro area or to other credit institutions which have neither their registered nor their head office inside the euro area; and branches, headquarters and subsidiaries of euro area-based credit institutions, as well as other credit institutions, located outside the euro area, to which euro banknotes would be distributed or sub-frontloaded, are not allowed to further sub-frontload euro banknotes to any third party   whatsoever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In contrast to the euro area, where frontloading and sub-frontloading may start as from 1 September 2001, the distribution and sub-frontloading outside the euro area will only be permitted as from 1 December 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Regarding the Euro 2002 Information Campaign, I should like to report to you that a detailed outline has been agreed and presented to the media, including the principal slogan to be used throughout the whole information campaign: the EURO.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">OUR money .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Moreover, a website dedicated to the campaign was launched in all 11 official languages of the European Community, and can be visited at www.euro.ecb.int.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The website contains a number of sections providing a broad range of information which should help specialist groups and the general public to prepare for the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">The Governing Council also agreed to organise a series of conferences on euro changeover issues - the "Euro 2002 Information Campaign conferences" - which will bring together the key parties involved in the euro cash changeover process at both national and European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">These events will be organised in the course of 2001 in all euro area Member States, hosted by the respective national central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The conferences will support the visibility of the Euro 2002 Information Campaign and prepare the ground for the mass media part of the campaign, which will begin in earnest in the last quarter of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The first conference of this series, to be hosted by the National Bank of Belgium, will take place tomorrow here in Brussels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Transcript of the questions and answers Chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath   Thank you very much for your introduction and your presentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">I'd also like to say that in the European Parliament, and in this Committee in particular, we have been delighted to see the commitment with regard to retail payments made by the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">We were rather impatient about that, and the ECB has actually shared this impatience, but I think maybe the end result will be that travellers, the general public and so on, will actually realise that the European Union represents advantages for them, and that monetary union is not just going to be a union for large payments but for all kinds of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">So I'd like to thank you expressly for that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And now we move on to our question and answer session.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Mr von Wogau to start.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Mr von Wogau   Thank you very much Mr Duisenberg for your presentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">I'd like to congratulate you for the very calm course that you have steered over the past few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.48,0)">It wasn't self-evident because of all the commotion that was going on across the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.36,0)">I have a question about the rate of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.19,0)">The latest inflation rate over 12 months - you've just mentioned it - is 2.4%, and you said that you were confident that in the medium-term this inflation rate would once again be forced down below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.46,0)">Now my question is, what does "in the medium-term" mean?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.66,0)">And also, I'd like to know whether it wouldn't be a negative signal if we were to note at the end of this year that the ECB over two successive years had missed that particular target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.63,0)">Shouldn't we then define medium-term as meaning before the end of this year?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">That leads me on to another question, and this has to do with our relationship with the United States of America and the level of our lead rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.93,0)">These have fallen in the States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">They have remained stable in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.16,0)">But the question is, who is following whom?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.61,0)">Is there any form of automaticity, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">if the United States reduces its rates does that mean that Europe is going to do the same?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg I expect the rate of inflation, as measured by the harmonised index of consumer prices, to fall within the 2% limit in the course of this year, so not even in the medium term but in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It may however take another 3-4 months before we are there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.3,0)">So I don't expect yet that in the future we will have to record the year 2001 as another one in which we have missed our target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.92,0)">As far as the United States' interest rate level is concerned, it is of course true that there it has fallen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.71,0)">Interest rates have been lowered and the ECB has stayed put and for the time being it will remain that way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">We very much await further signals of economic developments before coming to yet another move.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.33,0)">So there is no degree of automaticity either way in what is going to happen to official interest rates for the euro area, for which I can only speak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The only target we are endeavouring to achieve with our monetary policy, and therefore with the use of our monetary policy instruments, is the maintenance of price stability, and I mean internal price stability, over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Mr Goebbels   President, you've just told us that the interest rates are going to remain stable and I interpreted that statement from you as meaning that the European Central Bank will not be changing its policy with regard to rates before inflation has moved below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Is that interpretation correct?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg We have not changed policy and we will not change our monetary policy strategy - to that extent your interpretation is correct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.47,0)">But I would not hang it on a particular figure, whether it is being reached or not, and at what moment in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.88,0)">So, to that extent, your interpretation - I'm afraid to say - goes too far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Mr Goebbels   Well I'm very pleased to hear you say that, President, because that means that this notorious figure of 2% does not constitute a kind of limit that we can never go beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask another question linked to that, because the ECB has just published economic forecasts which, as you explained when you last spoke here, are forecasts by your services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.78,0)">However, does the ECB and the governing council, when it is taking its decisions, rely on the forecasts of its own services?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg First of all, I would like to re-emphasise that our monetary policy strategy is of a forward-looking nature and is directed towards the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Therefore, actual inflation figures, as they come out from month to month, are only being used as one of the indicators to determine our assessment of the policy to be pursued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Now the forecasts, as we have published them, are one of the elements on which we base our assessment of this forward-looking development of inflation and other economic variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.68,0)">They are one of the elements, not the exclusive one, and also, for our decisions, which we have to take every two weeks, those forecasts, as you know them, and as they have been published, become very quickly totally outdated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.33,0)">So we continuously reassess the value or the validity of the forecasts as they have been produced three or four or five months ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath   Thank you very much.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Mr Huhne.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.89,0)">Mr Huhne   Madam President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Perhaps Mr Duisenberg would come back to the question of the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">I'd just ask you whether, given the very strong reaction to developments in the US from the US Federal Reserve and indeed the fact that some other central banks have been reacting in the direction of an insurance principle - by getting some small reduction in interest rates in, in foreseeing potential impact on their economies of developments in the US and other economies around the world - whether you think that there is room for a similar insurance principle in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.5,0)">Particularly since, as you have said in your introduction, the balance of risks has clearly moved and you point out the fall, both in the observed inflation rate and, indeed, in the first pillar, the slowdown in monetary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg Yes, and then I concluded that the balance of risks had become more even.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.15,0)">A few months ago we thought that the balance of risk was still, so-called, on the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.6,0)">We don't conclude yet that the balance would now be on the downside, but it has become more even and there is, as I answered to Mr von Wogau, no automaticity, neither is there an insurance policy in monetary policy as a sort of reaction to monetary developments outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">We remain exclusively committed to maintaining, over the medium-term, price stability inside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">External factors, of course, play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">External developments play a role, also in our assessment of what the likely development is going to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.97,0)">But that's about all I can say about this particular aspect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Mr Huhne   Can I just follow up on that - the numbers for merchandise exports from the euro area to the United States suggest that they're about 2% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Presumably there's also an impact through exports of services, although I know it's difficult sometimes to get that from the numbers, and other possible avenues of transmission as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Would you expand a bit on how you see the influences working?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And I wonder too if you're taking what seems to be a very relaxed attitude towards developments in the United States, whether there's something of greater concern you're not expanding on within the euro area, and I'm particularly thinking there of recent wage developments?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Perhaps you'd tell us a bit more about wage developments going on within the euro area and if that is a matter of concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">You gave the ritual warning here that there should be wage moderation, but you didn't go into too much detail about what's actually happened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg To answer the last question first, the indications, as we have them, are that for the euro area as a whole, the wages policies are still being executed in a moderate manner.Wage moderation seems to be continuing, with the exception of some pockets where there is some acceleration visible and it may be induced by changes in taxation or administered prices which may have second round effects here and there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">On the whole, all signs as we get them, still point in the direction of a continued restraint in wage developments, which is gratifying, but it is crucial that it remains that way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Therefore I make the ritual reassurance, as I did it in my introduction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.39,0)">The impact of theslow down in the United States or indeed in world output growth on the euro area does not give rise to any relaxation of my attitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We monitor it closely, but we have to realise that the impact on the euro area, through the transmission mechanism of trade in merchandise, or indeed also trade in services, is rather limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.75,0)">The total exports to the outside world are only about 18% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Direct exports to the United States are only a fraction of that as you just said yourself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">To a very large extent, the euro area can be considered as a relatively closed economy, comparable to that of the United States or, indeed, Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath   Thank you very much.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.43,0)">Mr Lipietz.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Mr Lipietz   President, I'd just like to come back to the point about price trends in the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">I think that you were very clear in the past and you've been very clear today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.37,0)">You interpret the excess of 2% as a transitional factor, or a transitional phenomenon because of changes in oil prices and the difference in parity between the euro and the dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">So you're not changing your policy because you consider that this effect is only temporary, and maybe you're right in that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.88,0)">But it seems that as far as you're concerned, the interest rate policy should be determined by medium-term prospects, which you've determined essentially by the difference between the potential growth rate of the European Union, or the European economy, and its current rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I think that the current stability policy is in line with your analysis here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, you repeatedly told us that in December you'd be taking a decision on whether or not to revise the potential growth rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Now, you've made a statement today that there has been no change in productivity growth, and you feel that in the future the growth rate in the European economy would not exceed the level of the past 20 years, that is 2 1/2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Can you comment on that?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.77,0)">Mr Duisenberg The decision in December was the decision to leave the reference value for M3 growth unchanged, based on the analysis that there was no change in the trend rate of growth for the euro area discernible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Indeed, we estimate that still to be in the neighbourhood of 2 1/2% per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.16,0)">We continue to estimate that, for statistical reasons, the velocity of circulation keeps its downward trend of between 1/2 and 1% per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">So, in other words, there is no sign yet that we in Europe are already experiencing a phenomenon, which was so prevalent in the United States for many years, of a higher rate of growth of productivity than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.7,0)">It's not here yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath</span>
