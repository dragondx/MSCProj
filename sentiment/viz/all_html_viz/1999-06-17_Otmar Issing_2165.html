    <h3> Speaker: Otmar Issing </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)"> The ECB and its watchers Speech by Professor Otmar Issing, at the ECB Watchers Conference on 17 June 1999, in Frankfurt, Germany Introduction I am delighted to be presented with this opportunity to convey a central banker's view of monetary policy in this new and unprecedented setting of Stage Three of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">There are many dimensions to this new setting which need to be emphasised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.55,0)">But before I go on to talk about these, let me say a few words about my perception of the similarities and differences between the perspectives of the ECB and of its watchers on monetary policy issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.97,0)">I think it is in the nature of things that, in any discussion in which the participants start off from more or less different perspectives, it is the differences rather than the similarities of these perspectives that tend to get aired and emphasised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.9,0)">This is also true for the debate on monetary policy, where differences in perspective between the central bank on the one hand and academic and financial market commentators on the other, and indeed even within the latter two groups, tend to attract most attention, particularly in media circles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I think that this is not at all surprising since it is difficult to attract the attention of readers by documenting similarities of views between participants in a dialogue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.88,0)">Dissension, I would argue, is more newsworthy than consensus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.36,0)">How substantial are the differences of view among the participants to the debate on the setting, strategy and conduct to date of the ECB's monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.6,0)">Well, I think we don't really know until the domain of agreement between the participants is first identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We will then be in a better position to consider and assess, against the background of this domain of agreement, whether the differences in question go to the core, or are in fact merely peripheral, to the main issue involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But let me make an additional point before proceeding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">We are all journeying, in uncharted waters, towards a destination that is far from certain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.97,0)">Given the new and very uncertain environment, within which the monetary policy of the ECB must be conducted, a lot of the debate on monetary policy must, of necessity, be of a speculative nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">This leaves ample room for a wide diversity of fairly plausible views to be expressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Despite this, the domain of consensus is, I think, fairly broad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">There is virtual unanimity that the emphasis, which the Treaty places on price stability, is appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It is fully in keeping with the most up-to-date thinking on monetary theory and the weight of empirical evidence on the role of money in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The assignment of monetary policy to the ultimate goal of price stability is consistent with the widely held view that monetary policy is neutral with respect to the real economy in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Not only is there no long-run trade-off between price stability and growth of the real economy, but it is now widely accepted among all the main participants to the debate on monetary policy that price stability is a necessary condition for an economy to enjoy sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.41,0)">The corollary of this is that there is also implicitly, if not explicitly, virtual unanimity on what a central bank cannot do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.25,0)">It clearly cannot control real variables in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This includes the real components   of variables over whose nominal counterparts   the central bank does exercise some control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.96,0)">And, since interest rates are the dominant channel of transmission for monetary policy, this also implies that real magnitudes such as the overall level of activity in the economy or employment cannot be controlled by the central bank in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The only variables that the central bank can target effectively in the long run are therefore nominal variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Let me say why I think the control of such nominal variables is of critical importance in free-market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Efficient co-ordination in the economy cannot occur unless the various agents involved   speak the same monetary language.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.12,0)">The institution that allows them to do so is money, but more specifically the unit-of-account function of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.12,0)">The decentralised plans of hundreds of millions of consumers and millions of producers and distributors cannot mesh harmoniously in the aggregate if this common financial language, as encapsulated in the unit-of-account function of money, is missing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The efficiency of this language in performing this vital coÂ­ ordination role depends crucially on whether the unit of account always means the same thing to different individuals both at one and the same moment in time and over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">A necessary condition for it to mean the same thing is that price stability prevails both at any moment in time and with a credible commitment that it will continue to prevail in the indefinite future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">From this point of view, the commitment to maintaining price stability is like the standardisation of units of measurement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Accordingly, the best contribution a central bank can make to the performance of the real economy is to deliver price stability in a consistent and durable way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">There is also a fairly widespread consensus that, to achieve this objective, the central bank should formulate its monetary policy in a forward-looking way with a view to executing it in a pre-emptive fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.46,0)">It is essential to nip inflation in the bud before an inflationary psychology becomes entrenched in peoples' attitudes and behaviour which, of course, makes it much more difficult and costly to eradicate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Nor does there appear to be any significant divergence of views when it comes to the need for the central bank to employ systematically all the available information in formulating its monetary policy and determining its stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Agreement on the importance of price stability, and on the need for the central bank to act pre-emptively while making maximum and efficient use of all available information, indicates to me that a very important convergence of views has already occurred on the essentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">This provides a solid and broad foundation for a sensible dialogue between all the participants in the debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.41,0)">Having said this, there are still clearly identifiable differences of views on the modus operandi of the ECB's monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.4,0)">There is no broad agreement between academic economists and central bankers on: how to achieve price stability  , over what horizon it should be achieved if it does not already prevail   or, broadly speaking, on the day-to-day tactics used to implement the central bank's strategy  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.74,0)">It would be too broad a canvass to address all of these differences today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.34,0)">It would, nevertheless, be unreasonable not to expect me to touch upon a number of them and I will be doing so later in my presentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But before doing so let me make a few more general remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The dialogue between the ECB and its watchers should, I think, recognise a rather obvious but important fact of life, namely that a central bank has to act in real time in its execution of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.92,0)">I think it is inevitable that this will affect the nature of the dialogue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In my capacity as a member of the Executive Board of the ECB, I am responsible, along with others, for the formulation of the ECB's monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.7,0)">This also means that I am responsible for any mistakes that are made in setting the stance of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.95,0)">And, indeed, in a world in which uncertainty abounds, mistakes will be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.56,0)">We are not infallible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Central bankers have always been obliged, and will always be obliged to operate in a world of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.9,0)">In the realm of monetary policy, uncertainty is so great that even the past appears to change, as we know from ESA95, to take just one immediately relevant example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In this respect, the forecasting task confronting central banks is even greater than that facing meteorologists who can at least treat yesterday's weather as given.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.95,0)">However, central bankers cannot afford the luxury of suspending action until uncertainty has resolved itself, if only because, at least in part, the actions to be taken by the central bank are, in many cases, an ingredient to this resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.59,0)">Uncertainty, Risk and Ignorance Central banks operate in real time and need to make decisions in a world of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Academic economists have made great strides in examining economic behaviour in stochastic environments over the last two or three decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The breakthrough in analysing risk and its effects on economic behaviour are truly impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.08,0)">However, academic economists hardly need any reminding that "Knightian" uncertainty, which increasingly characterises the economic environment in which central banks have to operate, is altogether of a different dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.9,0)">Unlike risk, it is not measurable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.22,0)">This presents tricky problems for a discipline like economics where data are necessary to confirm or refute theoretical propositions before they can be of any practical use to central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Nobody who is even superficially acquainted with the whole EMU process would deny but that the level of uncertainty which the ECB has to confront on account of the transition to Stage Three of EMU is substantially heightened relative to that which would face a central bank in normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.8,0)">The origins of uncertainty facing the ECB are many and varied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.31,0)">Some are broadly political while others remain in the arena of technical economic and data-related issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.59,0)">Historically, political and currency jurisdictions have tended to coincide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This reflects the simple fact that the right to issue money has always been a key attribute of national sovereignty and therefore the transition to monetary union in Europe cannot be seen as an event of just a technical nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">One is indeed hard pressed to find any precedent in history, where sovereign nation states voluntarily ceded sovereignty in the monetary field to a genuinely supranational body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It is therefore clear that European Economic and Monetary Union has been, and will continue to be, not just an economic, but also a political project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Indeed, it is my firmly held view that the European integration process as a whole has been characterised by an interplay of political and economic forces and motivations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">We have fairly strong reasons to be confident that the long-run relationship between money and prices will remain as robust as it has proved, ubiquitously, to be in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Therefore, it should not be significantly affected by the transition to Stage Three of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">However, behaviour at high frequency is much more difficult to predict and will probably be strongly influenced by the regime shift accompanying the introduction of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.55,0)">The quality of our knowledge about behaviour over the short-to-medium term is much lower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">An essential question relates to the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Right now, we can only safely say that we know, at best, the broad contours of the area-wide EUI I transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Indeed, this is the most one could hope for since there has not been, by definition, a de jure central bank carrying out monetary policy for the whole area that now corresponds to the EUI I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">What we can say with certainty, however, is that there will be some important generic differences in the way monetary policy is transmitted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">There are elements of the transmission mechanism that will be quite different to that which faced those central banks in Stage Two that now comprise the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.39,0)">Some channels of transmission, for example that which arose from the bilateral exchange rates between member countries in Stage Two, have been removed entirely by the transition to Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.86,0)">Others will be deeply affected by the move to Stage Three itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Stage Three provides an ample forum for an intensification of the level of competition both within the banking industry, area wide, and between the latter as a unit and securities markets, area wide, which it is widely assumed will display new vigour with the advent of Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.4,0)">Since banks have, so far, tended to dominate the financial landscape in the EUI I, the repercussions for the transmission mechanism of the ECB's monetary policy could be profound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.79,0)">Not only do these types of behavioural changes affect the way in which the transmission mechanism operates, but they also affect, by implication, the information content of the types of indicators a central bank would normally look at.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Ascertaining the details of how the ECB's monetary policy is transmitted must therefore, of necessity, await the passage of time and the accumulation of experience with respect to monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.96,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB, therefore, faces some very specific uncertainties at the start of, and probably well into the early years, of Stage Three of EMU   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">These go well beyond the usual day-to-day uncertainties faced by central banks in the normal course of events in the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.79,0)">Another dimension of uncertainty which the ECB has to face relates to data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.91,0)">A general problem familiar to economists no matter what their persuasion is that the data used to test their theories do not correspond accurately to the economic concepts that enter their theories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.9,0)">Moreover, the available data, for the most part, don't measure accurately what it is they purport to measure, which indeed is rarely, if ever, the theoretical economic concepts of interest to economists   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.28,0)">In addition to this, many macroeconomic time series that are central to the formulation of monetary policy are subject to revision, which can sometimes be quite substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.66,0)">Apart from this, there are additional data problems facing the ECB at the start of Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.03,0)">These, it must be conceded, are particularly acute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.35,0)">Area-wide data, necessary to conduct area-wide analysis, are only patchily available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.68,0)">Any area-wide time series analysis has to rely on inferences made on the basis of the data constructed from Stage Two and the way in which these data are constructed is not beyond dispute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The first data from newly harmonised money and banking statistics for the whole euro area started to become available to the ECB last summer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.54,0)">Although these data are a considerable improvement on what was available prior to this, there is still a discontinuity in the data with which the ECB has to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.37,0)">It is unfortunate, but unavoidable, that this discontinuity coincides with the regime shift associated with the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.25,0)">This, in itself, magnifies the degree of uncertainty of the environment in which the ECB has to operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We are also about to see the introduction of a new set of national accounts  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.59,0)">Financial markets' reactions to any central bank move is an additional source of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.25,0)">The central bank's actual leverage over activity in the economy depends on how markets react to its policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.87,0)">There is enormous uncertainty about how the markets will receive any particular move in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.27,0)">A tightening of policy, say, could be interpreted in a number of ways: markets could anticipate that the move would be soon reversed, in which case it would probably have minimal effects on the economy; they could conclude that it was a permanent once-off move, in which case the markets might react strongly; or, they could perceive the move as the first in a series of moves in the same direction leading to a rather violent reaction as we saw in the Spring of 1994 in the US, following a Fed tightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.13,0)">The central bank therefore also has to try and assess and factor in the mood of the markets, which, at the best of times, is a rather amorphous phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.56,0)">In sum, the problems posed by uncertainty are manifold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.66,0)">It would be an extravagant pretension on my part if I were to claim that a central bank, entrenched in this world of uncertainty, would never make a policy error.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.57,0)">Although it has to take decisions and operate in a world of uncertainty, the monetary policy actions taken by the central bank should, above all, avoid being, in themselves, an additional source of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.25,0)">Central bank should seek to avoid adding to uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">I am firmly convinced that the best contribution a central bank can make to reducing uncertainty is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.11,0)">Only when price stability prevails do the relative price signals on the basis of which investors, businesses and the public at large make decisions not give misleading information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">By maintaining price stability, the central bank can make its maximum contribution to minimising distortions in the allocation of resources and therefore make its maximum contribution to the productive potential of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.81,0)">Since households, but more particularly firms, must take decisions with a fairly long horizon in mind, it is essential that inter-temporal relative prices   are not distorted by various dead-weight loss risks linked to high and variable inflation if these decisions are not to lead to a further misallocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.35,0)">I think that we should always be careful to avoid succumbing to the hubris of thinking that we have conquered uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.98,0)">Furthermore, I think it is ultimately uncertainty about the details of how the economy operates that inevitably frustrates any central bank devoted to a philosophy of stabilising the real economy by endeavouring to fine tune output indefinitely just at its potential level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.77,0)">Such a central bank is inevitably operating in comparative darkness - something akin to guiding an aircraft in dense fog without the benefit of radar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.64,0)">It does not have sufficient information on the complex structure and dynamic behaviour of the economy to achieve this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.9,0)">Much less has it accurate information on how the economy may undergo subtle changes in response to its own monetary policy actions - a particularly acute problem for the ECB in the early years of Stage Three of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.95,0)">Mistakes are therefore virtually unavoidable and attempts at fine- tuning could conceivably destabilise further, rather than stabilise, the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.03,0)">This would add unnecessarily to the uncertainty facing the private sector of the economy and would disrupt the allocation of resources both at a point in time and across time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">I think we can still learn from the advice given by Robert Lucas, one of the leading economists of the day, writing back in I980   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">He argued that a possible response to the inability of the economics profession to assess the likely consequences of economic policies in anything like a scientific way, which he argued was "well beyond the current limits of our discipline"   is to make it "as clear as possible that the main task of monetary and fiscal policy is to provide a stable and predictable environment for the private sector of the economy"  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.26,0)">The Role of Money in the ECB's Monetary Policy Strategy There is widespread agreement that inflation in the medium-to-long term is a monetary phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The relationship between money and prices is one of the most robust stylised facts in economics, if not the most robust, known to economists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.08,0)">Robert Lucas, in his Nobel Lecture has, thankfully, recently reminded us of this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Let me again quote from him "...the prediction that prices respond proportionately to changes in money in the long run, deduced by Hume in 1752  , has received ample - I would say decisive - confirmation, in data from many times and places."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Indeed, the evidence would seem to be so strong over long historical time periods and across a very wide range of countries that it is tempting to conclude that the money-prices relationship may be immune to regime shifts, even one as seminal as the introduction of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.7,0)">Until we obtain strong and convincing evidence to the contrary, it would be foolhardy to assume that it is not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Developments in the amount of money held by the public are therefore seen as containing useful information about future price developments and thereby provide a useful compass to the ECB in the formulation of its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.79,0)">The ECB is, nevertheless, acutely aware that the regime shift accompanying the introduction of the euro will almost certainly bring in its wake short- run behavioural discontinuities that are likely to make the job of the ECB an awful lot more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the case of the demand for money, a number of institutional factors will potentially act as special influences on the evolution of the broad money stock in the euro area in Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.48,0)">Portfolio shifts following the implementation of the changes related to the new reserve requirement system is one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Another is change in taxation of interest revenues, capital gains and wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Disintermediation and increased competition, off-balance sheet securitisation as well as financial innovation and portfolio diversification out of the euro area are all possible additional influences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.18,0)">In addition, theory suggests one channel through which the creation of a monetary union would lead to a discrete reduction in the demand for money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The reduction arises from the elimination of foreign exchange transactions costs for cross-border business within the euro zone with the advent of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.42,0)">Agents who operated in more than one of the EUI I countries in Stage Two would have held more money balances for a given volume of transactions than they would have had for the same volume of total transactions within the borders of a single member state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It can be shown to be more profitable to hold money balances across borders denominated in the currency of the location of the issuer than to incur the transactions costs of going through the foreign exchange market for each cross-border transaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.34,0)">The merger of the EUI I currencies into one as of January last may have eliminated these costs completely and resulted, or be currently in the process of resulting, in a discrete downward jump in the demand for money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">On the other hand, uncertainty connected with the transition to Stage Three may also lead to an increased preference for liquidity in general thereby increasing, for a while at least, the demand for money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.41,0)">However, time must necessarily elapse before evidence can be assembled of any such shifts in the demand for money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.81,0)">All this necessarily means that we have to be very cautious in the way we interpret evidence from the economies of member countries in Stage Two of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.18,0)">Moreover there are, it must be conceded, problems in measuring money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">This is especially the case now with the ongoing widespread financial market deregulation, rapid financial innovation and dramatic improvements in payments technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.32,0)">These developments are sometimes interpreted by economists as meaning that "money no longer matters".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.46,0)">Personally, I don't see it that way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.15,0)">Money remains important but has become a more fuzzy concept and more difficult to measure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">To me this means that we have to redouble our efforts to home in on more reliable empirical measures that take these changes on board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.52,0)">An incorrect response of monetary policy to money can lead to severe mistakes in the actions taken by the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.15,0)">More specifically, two types of errors are possible, lets call them type I and type 2 error.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.4,0)">The first type of error occurs when the central bank concludes, on the basis of the best possible evidence available, that money demand is stable but this conclusion turns out to be wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.28,0)">It acts according to this wrong conclusion, attaching a high weight to the money aggregate in its monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.93,0)">It therefore attaches too much importance to money resulting in a policy move that proves to be too loose or too tight depending on how the monetary aggregate was expected to move relative to the target or reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.12,0)">When some academics and commentators in financial markets criticise central bankers for what they perceive as their over-reliance on money, this is the type of event they typically have in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.26,0)">Error type 2, on the contrary, tends to be downplayed among academic economists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.35,0)">This concerns a situation in which the central bank carries out policy on the basis of the assumption that the demand for money function is unstable when in fact it is stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.53,0)">This mistake is also likely to end up in the price stability objective being missed, since the central bank will not respond to money supply growth, whether this be too rapid or too slow, when it should respond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is a situation in which, for example, money is growing more rapidly than would be warranted by money demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.59,0)">However, the central bank mistakenly discounts entirely the information in money demand, since it assumes that the money demand function is unstable and acts accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The upshot is an acceleration of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.87,0)">A central bank must therefore ask itself what is the optimal strategy with respect to money when the chances of money demand being stable or unstable are about even.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I think the strategy should be to eschew using money as an intermediate target of monetary policy   but, at the same time, not to discount the information content in the money aggregate completely  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.67,0)">The outcome would be to treat money as a reference value where the central bank retains the option of responding to money if it is deemed to have deviated too far from some prescribed reference value - i.e., the ECB selected role for the monetary aggregate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">All of the estimates of money demand that have been found for Stage Two of EMU suggests strongly that area-wide money demand is quite stable   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Indeed, the most recent area-wide EUI I money demand estimates which have been produced within the ECB using data up to the very end of Stage Two also suggest that area-wide money demand for the EUI I is stable   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">The estimates produced also pass a battery of statistical tests for robustness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">An interesting result that also emerges from these studies is that area-wide money demand estimates typically have superior properties - in terms of fit and stability - to many national equations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.47,0)">The idea that this apparent stability of area-wide money demand may be a mirage has been suggested by some observers  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.19,0)">The argument is that country-specific idiosyncrasies, which have tended to wash out in Stage Two, will tend, on the contrary, to become positively correlated in Stage Three and yield an unstable area-wide demand for money function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The evidence produced by our experts in the ECB would suggest that, even in the extreme case of these correlations becoming perfect in Stage Three, the standard error of the area-wide equation, although increasing significantly, would still compare favourable with national equations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.77,0)">On the basis of the available evidence, I think that the ECB is being rather cautious in the way it has chosen to employ money in its monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">All of these problems I have just flagged may present themselves, and possibly in a particularly virulent form, at the start of Stage Three of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.8,0)">At any one time, a central bank cannot be completely certain whether the demand for money function is stable or unstable or whether it is likely to become unstable if the central bank were to opt for strict monetary targeting  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">All it can do is to make the best use of the available evidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.29,0)">But, unlike academic economists, it cannot afford to enjoy the comparative luxury of experimenting, by trial and error, with different possibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.8,0)">It has to commit itself to making a judgement within a short span of time and take the consequences if it gets it wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.81,0)">It cannot sit on the fence, wait for reality to prove it wrong and then go back to the drawing board and draw up an alternative strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.1,0)">There is a standard caricature of economists, including academic economists, in which no two of them in any arbitrary large set of economists can agree about the true state of the economy and how it functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Although a caricature, it nevertheless has to be conceded that there are indeed a sizeable number of academic perspectives on how the economy really operates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.89,0)">Academic economists sometimes criticise central banks for not acting according to their model of the world or that the model of the world that is informing central bank actions is one with which they cannot agree.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.87,0)">But then academic economists can't agree among themselves about the true model of the world that would be appropriate for a central bank to employ in its formulation of its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.93,0)">It is therefore probably not surprising that some of the ECB Watchers represented here today don't always agree among themselves on a number of issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And one of these issues is clearly money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Some calculations performed by the ZEI   leads it to the conclusion that the ECB's monetary reference value of 4.5% "appears to be well chosen" and that it should be "compatible with low rates of increase in the EMU price level over the next few years"   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">CEPS is a good deal less bullish about the usefulness of a reference value for money growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.28,0)">It concludes that: "The reference value for broad money growth   is not a useful guide to policy in the short-run, especially during the early life of the euro, but an abrupt slowing of credit growth should be considered a warning signal"  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The CEPR, although making its views known about its preferred strategy for the ECB before the ECB announced its strategy, expressed similar views to those of the CEPS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">It said: "Like many other indicators, monetary aggregates should be carefully monitored because they will be helpful in identifying inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">But it is misguided to focus solely on money stock growth rates, hoping for a close relationship with future inflation during the policy regime change in the early days of the EMU."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.88,0)">These statements would suggest to me that there are indeed significant differences of views about the role of money in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.49,0)">My own view, and that of the ECB, is not too far away from some of the views expressed by some ECB watchers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">I think the long-run money- inflation nexus is sufficiently strong to survive regime shifts, including the start of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I think we should guard against the danger of slipping into the trap of thinking that money is unimportant when inflation is low and ignore the overwhelming evidence that, as Lucas has reminded us, all past episodes of persistent inflation have been preceded, or accompanied, by rapid money growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">However, it is unavoidable, given the types of uncertainties I have just mentioned, that a substantial measure of judgement will have to be exercised in interpreting short-run movements in the money stock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.48,0)">This may, incorrectly, look like excessive indulgence in discretion to the outside world, but its only purpose is, I can assure you, to prevent short-run developments in money threatening the medium term orientation of the ECB's monetary policy strategy to underpin price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I am fully aware of how important it is to avoid the impression of excessive discretion and therefore for the ECB to explain how the ongoing operation of its strategy feeds into monetary policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.0,0)">In case of doubt, a central bank has no option but to fall back on the tried and tested fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">More generally, the favoured monetary policy strategies for the ECB of its main academic Watchers appear to be quite distinct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As I have already noted, ZEI favours monetary targeting as conducted by the Bundesbank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">It interprets the ECB's strategy as "standing directly in the tradition of the Bundesbank, even though a different rhetoric is being used"   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.09,0)">However, it flags what it perceives as the risk that the ECB will, in the course of time, be converted to the philosophy of "looking at everything", which it argues would mean a downgrading of the importance of the monetary reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.65,0)">ZEI are, in other words, raising the prospect of the ECB not paying enough attention to money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.94,0)">CEPS, on the other hand, argues essentially that the ECB is in danger of paying too much attention to money and dubs the role of money in the ECB's strategy as "eclectic and discretionary".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.83,0)">It argues, incidentally in agreement with the ECB, that money demand instabilities at the beginning of Stage Three would render strict monetary targeting inadvisable, but adds that the scope for discretion in the strategy will create "difficulties of communication with financial markets and the public at large"   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">It then expresses a preference for direct inflation targeting because of what it sees as its transparency and the ease of communication which this facilitates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.92,0)">CEPR criticises the ECB for not announcing a policy rule that would govern its behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It offers three reasons for this proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">It would, it is argued, help to inform internal decision making by providing a systematic management information system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Secondly, a rule would constitute an important communication device.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">And, thirdly, it would act as a "commitment device in the strategic interaction of ECB and fiscal authorities, not to mention wage setters, in the Euro I I ..."  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Although I may be doing violence to reality by only giving a gist of what these proposals are I, nevertheless, think the following remark is in order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Despite the fact that all the proposals on the ECB's strategy are quite distinct from each other, they all invoke transparency as the main justification for their particular proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.94,0)">And, by implication, the ECB's strategy lacks transparency to a greater or lesser extent depending on the perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.58,0)">But this, it has to be admitted, is somewhat ironic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This is because transparency here must mean transparency with respect to their own respective proposals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">But only one of these proposals, at most, can be best supported by the true state of nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In adopting that proposal, the ECB would enhance its chances of achieving transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.3,0)">But, in adopting any of the other two proposals, it would, by corollary, diminish its chances of achieving transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.45,0)">This places the central bank in a quandary -which proposal should it adopt?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.42,0)">I pose this question merely to make the point that some of the criticism launched at the ECB for its alleged lack of transparency could be interpreted as no more than expressions of the particular models of the economy to which some of our watchers subscribe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.93,0)">I think it would be very difficult for practical central bankers to bear the responsibility of following a simple rule in the uncertain circumstances, which are without precedent, surrounding the early years of Stage Three of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.64,0)">The new currency in itself, the regime shift associated with the new currency which will probably result in behavioural discontinuities as well as the severe data problems, all of which I have already adumbrated, will provide a very weak empirical basis for clinging to any simple rule as a basis for monetary policy decision making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Credibility, Transparency and Accountability The issue of credibility is now a central concern for both central banks and for scholarly study.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Since there are many dimensions to credibility, it may be helpful to start off with a definition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.59,0)">Credibility can be defined as: "The ability to have one's statements accepted as factual or one's motives as the true ones"   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Central bank credibility will therefore be enhanced   if there is a close   correspondence between its words and deeds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.11,0)">This means, of course, that central banks must choose their words very carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.79,0)">To maintain a high correspondence between its words and its actions, and thus its credibility, a central bank cannot be too definitive about the true state of the world, given the pervasive uncertainty and the ignorance that this breeds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.29,0)">If it were to take a very definite view of how the world functions, and to use this view as a basis for its monetary policy actions and as a vehicle for communicating with the public and if, in the event, the world does not oblige by accommodating this view, then the central bank jeopardises its own credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.81,0)">The inherent uncertainty faced by the central bank cannot be wished away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.87,0)">The proliferation of different and competing perspectives among academics themselves about how the world functions, about which I have just spoken, is merely symptomatic of this uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.01,0)">Therefore, it is precisely because the consequences of the words it chooses to use are crucial for its own credibility, that these words may sometimes sound like an entirely new language, "central bank speak" so to say, which is designed to blur and obfuscate rather than to clarify   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Nothing could be further from the truth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.14,0)">Because credibility is of immediate practical concern for central bankers, but of only, shall I say, "academic" concern for academic economists, a central bank has to ensure that it does not damage its own credibility by choosing words it may have to repudiate later with adverse real consequences for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I think it is fair to say that academic apostasy, by way of contrast, is hardly such a catastrophe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.46,0)">There is ample opportunity to go back to the drawing board and re-commence with at worst a loss of face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It is clear therefore that a central bank cannot risk pinning its colours to the mast of any particular academic perspective on the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.77,0)">It may consequently be seen to be at loggerheads with academic economists of all hues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.76,0)">A further complicating factor, that is not always appreciated is that the central bank's credibility is itself part of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The linkage between the policy actions it takes, and the effects of these actions, depends in part on how credible the central bank is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">This credibility channel of monetary policy is, as we know, particularly strong in the bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.38,0)">But central bank credibility is also likely to affect other areas of the economy such as the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.64,0)">If, for example, unions feel that any inflationary consequences of their actions are not going to be tolerated by an accommodating monetary policy stance, then they are probably less likely to seek wage settlements in excess of productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.92,0)">The leverage of central bank policy actions over the economy therefore depends, in an integral way, on its own credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.14,0)">But this very fact complicates the task of formulating monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To gauge the effects of any particular monetary policy action on the economy the central bank has, in principle, to make some assumption about the degree of its own credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.1,0)">What should it assume?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.92,0)">If, for example, it mistakenly assumes that it is fully credible, it may overestimate the leverage of its monetary policy actions over the economy and therefore underestimate the monetary policy dosage needed to counteract an inflationary threat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.79,0)">It may, in other words, opt for too small a monetary policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.68,0)">The obverse would hold in a situation in which it mistakenly underestimated its own credibility   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.42,0)">I sometimes can't help feeling that this type of dilemma facing a central bank is not fully appreciated in some of the commentary I have been reading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The former vice-president of Fed, Alan Blinder, conducted a very interesting and recent survey   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.38,0)">It was designed to ascertain whether, and how, the views of academics differed from those of central bankers on the issue of central bank credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.35,0)">He surmised that differences of views might be expected for several reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Firstly, academic economists are above all theorists and econometricians while central bankers are, for the most part, practitioners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Secondly, almost all economists in his sample were educated in the US while the central bankers in the sample came from 84 different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The results suggested that central bankers place a very high importance on credibility - the mean response was between "quite important" and "of the utmost importance" with a rather small standard deviation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.97,0)">Although academics also thought that credibility was very important the score they attached to it was somewhat lower than that of central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This, I think, is consistent with what I said above about the practical significance of credibility to central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Blinder concluded from his survey that central bankers thought credibility was important because it makes disinflation less costly, because it helps to keep down inflation once it is low and helps garner public support for central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">When it comes to ways of establishing credibility, the views of academics and central bankers are more closely aligned: it is established in the old-fashioned way by building a track record of living up to one's word.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Interestingly, two of the methods emphasised in the literature - pre-commitment and incentive compatible contracts - are rated as least important by both groups of respondents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">According to King et al   , "Accountability refers to the need to justify and accept responsibility for decisions taken" while transparency is defined as "..a process by which information about existing conditions, decisions, and actions is made accessible, visible and understandable".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.45,0)">An agent that is held accountable for its actions is more likely to deliver on its mandate than one that is not held accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.23,0)">However, the principal, which could be assumed to be collectively the people of the EUl I, who has delegated the conduct of monetary policy to a specialised agent  , has no means at its disposal by which to hold the agent accountable unless the agent is required to be transparent about what it is doing, on an ongoing basis, to fulfil its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Transparency is therefore an important ingredient of accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The ECB is both accountable and transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The ECB has a mandate determined by the Treaty, which stipulates how it should be accountable to the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It should do so through its Annual and Quarterly Reports and in testimony delivered to Sub- Committee on Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Accountability is therefore not really an issue ex post in the sense that the ECB can be clearly and publicly seen to be fulfilling the requirements of the Treaty which are rather specific.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">However, some have argued that the ECB should strive to make itself accountable in perhaps a less narrowly constitutional way and to a broader constituency, namely to public opinion in the EUI I as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">This, it is argued, would require winning the confidence of financial markets and informed public opinion   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The contention is that this would be achievable through a very high degree of transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This I fully agree with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Indeed, these considerations have been behind the ECB's decision to go beyond the already stringent reporting requirements stipulated in the Treaty in its determination to be as transparent as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These Treaty requirements are already being supplemented by regular press conferences following each Council meeting as well as in its regular publications   and in speeches by members of the Executive Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">As I have mentioned already, there is an active programme of communication with academics and one of the channels for promoting this communication, the ECB's Working Paper Series, has just been launched on the 2 nd of June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.17,0)">There has been some speculation to the effect that central banks in general, including the ECB, may have strategic reasons for hiding information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.75,0)">One such motive, it is claimed, is to enable the central bank to subsequently engage in policy surprises   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I can safely say that nothing could be further from the truth as far as the ECB is concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As I have noted already, one of the overriding principles guiding the monetary policy of the ECB is to avoid adding to the high level of uncertainty already facing the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This is the basic rationale that inspires the medium-term orientation of its monetary policy strategy, which is also reflected in its desire to avoid excessive monetary policy activism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Clarity in justifying monetary policy actions so that these actions are understood and therefore predictable is of central importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The key is to provide a stable environment within which the private sector can perform and plan for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.7,0)">For firms undertaking investment projects with long gestation periods, the future in question is rather long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">It is therefore crucially important that the central bank gains and maintains credibility for its price stability objective not only over the short-to-medium term horizon but over all future horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.16,0)">Another strategic motivation ascribed to the ECB for its alleged failure to publish the summary minutes of the meetings of the Governing Council arises from the desire to hide internal disagreement or to avoid subsequent blame   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.56,0)">This is also off the mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.26,0)">Apart from the voting patterns, most of what is in the minutes also appears in abbreviated form in the President's press statement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.34,0)">So the only item of substance that is not communicated to the public is the voting behaviour of the members of the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The reason for this is straightforward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It reflects the requirements of the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Publication of the voting records would be likely to associate NCB governors - in the mind of the public - with national viewpoints rather than with the euro area which is the mandate agreed to in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">It is gratifying to note that at least one of the ECB Watchers represented here today acknowledges this point   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Let me quote the relevant section: "In terms of accountability and transparency, we would urge the ECB to err on the side of openness by providing a detailed and reasoned account of its decisions and minutes that, while remaining informative, makes it impossible to infer national points of view."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I think what we are being urged to do here matches very closely what we are actually doing in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Resuming my theme, that the central bank should do nothing to add to the level of uncertainty confronting the private sector of the economy, it follows that we as central bankers need to act, and to convey our actions to the public, in such a way that errors in the markets' expectations of what the central bank is going to do is minimised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">We at the ECB are therefore very conscious of the need for a high level of transparency in our approach to monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Quite apart from it being a requirement of an independent and accountable central bank, it is, as we have seen, also a way of increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Transparency is a matter of degree.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">I think the framework has been put in place for the ECB will guarantee that it will achieve a very high level of transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And, as I have indicated, the statutory requirements of the Treaty constitute only the starting point for the standards of transparency, which the ECB has set for itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The Roles of Academic Economists and Practical Central Bankers There is now virtually complete consensus on the primacy of what I call the core monetary policy values, which I mentioned in my introductory remarks, i.e., the overriding concern for maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This has been arrived at after a long dialogue among academic economists on inflation and its adverse effects on the smooth operation of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">This has been a very fruitful discussion culminating in the literature on the dead-weight losses from inflation and time inconsistency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The gain monetary policy has made from this debate, and the monetary reforms that it inspired, has been invaluable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">More generally, we as central bankers have gained inestimably from the often radical and untrammelled thinking that takes place between academic economists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We cannot lose sight of the fact that it was largely the academic debate among economists   that resulted in central banks being put centre stage since the 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This debate re-emphasising the importance of money for the control of inflation and consequently for the smooth functioning of capitalist economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I can probably say this with more conviction than most central bankers since I myself come from an academic background.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Academia has always, and rightly so, prided itself in its open and free thinking spirit which is, and should be, ready at all times to attack the citadel of the conventional wisdom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">I am convinced that dialogue is an essential ingredient in arriving at the truth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.16,0)">A dialectical process, arguably, drives this discovery process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.36,0)">This consists of the dominant existing theory   being questioned, because of its inability to explain the facts, by a rival theory   with the ultimate outcome being yet a new theory  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This new theory may become the new paradigm for a period of time before being challenged again by yet a newer theory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">If this is a good description of the process at work, then we should welcome criticism particularly if it generates a fruitful dialogue between central bankers and academic economists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Not only do we welcome it, we need it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Our very presence here today is a concrete manifestation of this process at work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">We are happy when we hear views being expressed that are supportive of the ECB's position coming from academia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">We put a premium on these views given the reputation of academic economists for rigour in their analysis and the fact that we know that the comment is coming from a critical environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Although this may sound strange, we need to hear views even more when there is disagreement because this is when we learn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">When views are not supportive of the ECB's position but are well founded in good theory and obtain robust corroboration from the data, then again I think the ECB can only gain from a dialogue with academia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.46,0)">In the spirit of the dialectical process I just mentioned, this can only be a win- win situation for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">I should mention in passing that we already have a very lively interaction with academic economists on a number of levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Many of you will already have been to the EMI/ECB presenting your views and discussing issues of immediate interest with our economists in the context of our Invited Speaker Programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.07,0)">A number of academic economists also act as occasional consultants with the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">On the other hand, ECB economists present their work at academic conferences on a regular basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">I should also mention that the Working Paper Series, which the ECB has just launched, should also be seen as an integral part of this interactive and transparent process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This has my full support and I hope interaction with the academia will be deepened in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Notwithstanding this, I think it has to be conceded that the opposite of a fruitful dialectical dialogue can also occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It does so when a consensus within mainstream academia becomes all consuming.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.93,0)">This I think is very dangerous because it is likely to stifle innovative thinking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.58,0)">My admiration for the open and anarchic nature of academic debate has to be tempered by examples of cases where the type of creative dialectical thinking I have mentioned seems to have been suffocated by a consensus that endured too long among academic economists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">One particular example of this of which we should not lose sight is the fact that it was academic economists that brought thinking on policy to the unfortunate consensus that emphasised policies of aggregate demand management to the exclusion of virtually all other policy considerations in the 1950s and 1960s and that resulted in the stagflation of the 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.82,0)">In a recent monograph dealing with what the author, Thomas Mayer, describes as one of the greatest failures of US macroeconomic policies, i.e., the failure that resulted in the high and variable inflation of the late 1960s and 1970s, he writes the following: "When starting out I thought that I would land up with a scathing criticism of the Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">But in working my way through the material I began to understand why the Fed did what it did, and that the blame for the mistaken policies that it followed should be shared in large part by the academic economists whose writings encouraged these policies"   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Indeed, it is hard to disagree with Hayek when he said, on receipt of his Nobel Prize for economics in 1974, that: "Economists are, at this moment, called upon to say how to extricate the free world from the serious threat of accelerating inflation which, it must be admitted, has been brought about by policies that the majority of economists recommended or even urged governments to pursue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.45,0)">We have indeed at the moment little cause for pride: as a profession we made a mess of things."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.22,0)">This is an example of an academic consensus that became all consuming, stifling innovative thinking and, worst of all, resulting in very poor policy from which it took our economies decades to recover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.68,0)">Although I am, I suppose, now in the lion's den in a sense in that I am surrounded by academic economists, this is an episode I can safely mention since most of the economists involved have passed away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">If one is prepared to overlook this type of occasional aberration, then one can only welcome this open dialectical process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.99,0)">However, it has to be admitted that some dimensions of the process present more difficulties than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Demolishing a fortress is much easier than building up an alternative and superior fortress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.73,0)">It is generally far easier to dispose than to propose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Elaborating an alternative and superior model requires hard and laborious work etched out over years, if not decades, before it becomes acceptable to one's peers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is as it should be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It takes even longer for it to be accepted in policy circles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This is also as it should be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.11,0)">This is because it is not enough that academics build models that are admirable in their mathematical perfection and beauty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">They must, for practical monetary policy purposes, also be workable and operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.56,0)">There can be a world of difference between the two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In academia, there is no limit for the exercise of the untrammelled imagination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.27,0)">Ideas that appear sensible at first sight may turn out, in retrospect, to be seriously flawed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.32,0)">And, of course, ideas that look nonsensical at first sight may also prove to be nonsensical with the passage of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Nevertheless, in academia, all these ideas get a hearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.89,0)">This is yet another reason why central banks cannot follow every fashion in academic thinking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Even academics themselves will readily admit that some academic ideas are stillborn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Central banks must depend on the coherent conceptual frameworks elaborated in academia as a starting point for their own analyses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.6,0)">They do not have the resources to do the fundamental theoretical work that is necessary to elaborate a fully coherent model of the economy from scratch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Making the best judgement it can between the competing models, none of which could be said to claim a monopoly of the truth, it is probably fair to say that the typical central bank's views of the world are somewhat eclectic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.29,0)">They tend therefore to differ from what academics think, most of whom adhere to their own pure theoretical models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.34,0)">These models to some extent define the identity of the economists who built them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">They clearly have a vested interest in defending their own models since they will have devoted a substantial fraction of their professional lives building them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.21,0)">They can, of course, afford to do so since, unlike central banks, they are rarely called upon to act on the basis of their beliefs derived from their models in ways that impinge materially on the welfare of most people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In any critical assessment of the performance of a central bank and of its transparency, the issue of uncertainty has to be faced fairly and squarely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Central banks receive ample advice and criticism from many quarters - academic economists, financial markets and the banking community as well as the financial press, all of whom I notice are represented here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It is almost inevitable, therefore, that, after the fact, some of these will have called the situation more accurately than the central bank   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.27,0)">However, such comparisons may not be valid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Valid judgements must be made on the basis of ex ante considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.24,0)">Any critical assessment of the decisions of a central bank must be made on the basis of ex ante mistakes not ex post mistakes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.67,0)">I think therefore that the task which those academic economists, who comment on the monetary policy actions taken by a central bank, should set themselves should be the following: they should offer plausible arguments that the mistakes made by the central bank, which only become evident ex post, were predictable on the basis of the real time situation faced by the central bank when the policy action was taken, i.e., given the real time dataset available to it, its interpretation of the information content of that data and the minimalist assumptions about how the transmission mechanism operates as well as assumptions about its own credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In other words, only in the light of the full uncertainty, which the central bank faces in real time, can one make a fair assessment of its performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.39,0)">I don't think that most academic economists, who are critical of central banks' monetary policy actions, actually always do this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.64,0)">In precisely this context, it is worth noting that some of the recent emerging literature on monetary policy rules that have been used to criticise the past performance of central banks, have themselves been shown to be subject to shortcomings when policy is examined in real time, i.e., in the context in which central banks have to operate in reality   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.18,0)">All I am saying here is that valid criticism requires that central bank watchers should ask themselves what advice they would offer on current and future monetary policy stance if they themselves were actually in charge of policy and if they had to take the same considerations into account as the central bank itself while operating in real time and in comparative darkness about how the economy functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">I think that there is another very important aspect of the dialogue between central bankers and academia, which should be flagged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.69,0)">Practical central bankers are very conscious that they cannot facilely make inferences about, say, the transmission mechanism, and then make public policy statements based on these inferences that deviate significantly from the true state of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.28,0)">If they do, they risk losing credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.67,0)">This may materially affect the lives of millions of people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.05,0)">Academic economists can, by contrast, be as contentious as they wish in public without jeopardising the health of the economy for the obvious reason that they do not normally play a direct policy role in the economy   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The public understands their publications and statements as part of the free exchange of views traditionally associated with academia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.77,0)">This fact inevitably affects the terms of the debate between the ECB and its watchers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There are some questions I would like to pose to academic economists following the ideas I have presented here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.84,0)">Do they perceive themselves as having a special or additional responsibility when they comment as an "ECB watcher"?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.57,0)">To what extent do you envisage yourselves as constituting a kind of "shadow central bankers"?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">If so, your comments are likely to have an effect, potentially a significant one, on how financial markets react to our policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Does this suggest to you that you should take greater care in commenting in such a context than you might be tempted to do if you were simply responding to another academic colleague on a paper of mutual interest?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Maybe you should reflect on this - from my side I have no particular answer to offer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Conclusions The ECB is conscious of the need to have the public on its side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">By keeping the public fully and openly informed of the rationale for its monetary policy actions, the ECB is more likely to have the public behind it in crucial debates on monetary policy in the public forum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The ECB is therefore conscious of the fact that the ultimate defence of monetary stability may be found more in the support of public opinion than in statute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">It is therefore confirmed in its intention to communicate with the public in a clear and transparent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">An important task it has set for itself is therefore to explain clearly and succinctly how it sees its tasks, how it sees the world operating and how it goes about achieving its objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In designing a monetary policy strategy to achieve the dual objective of maintaining price stability as well as serving as a vehicle for communicating with the public, some fairly reliable ideas about how the economy functions is a sine qua non.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For the ECB, the conceptual framework for this understanding is provided by its stability-oriented monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This facilitates discussion of policy within the Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It allows the potentially different signals indicated by the monetary data on the one hand and the broadly based assessment on the other to be reconciled in an open fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.33,0)">Public articulation of the upward and downward risks to price stability naturally supplements this discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In sum, what's important is that the discussion within the Governing Council be as open and frank as possible and that the balance of arguments within the Council, rather than the voting behaviour, be communicated to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">With Stage Three of EMU still only less than a half year old, we cannot, of course, be completely sure as to how effective this communication strategy will turn out to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.75,0)">We are monitoring it assiduously and are prepared to amend it if it is deemed, with the passage of time, to be deficient in some respects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In order to further enhance the transparency of its strategy and how it operates in practice, the ECB, reflecting its own learning process, will gradually provide more information on how a variety of monetary policy indicators impinge on its monetary policy decision making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I hope I don't sound too pompous when I say that some of the most fruitful insights into the business of central banking have tended to come from those who have crossed the divide between academia and central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.5,0)">Although I fall into this category myself, I don't propose to quote from myself to bring my talk to a conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.72,0)">Instead, let me quote from someone else who has temporarily crossed this divide in recent times, i.e., Alan Blinder: "There has long been a symbiosis between practical central banking and academic research on monetary policy ...............</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">But while this symbiotic relationship continues, I believe that large potential gains from trade in ideas between practitioners and academics remain unexploited"   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">For one who is still, and will be for ever, deeply affected by the spirit of academia, I can safely say that never has the situation been more urgent to exploit such potential gains than in the current context as we embark on the hazardous process of monetary union in Europe .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">I believe in a strong and continuous competition for ever higher quality between the ECB, in its monetary policy decision-making on the one side, and the arguments of its watchers on the other side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This will yield important synergies and make a constructive contribution to ensuring that episodes like the Great Inflation of the late 1960s and 1970s, or similar abuses of monetary policy, that are avoidable, will never again occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Some of these uncertainties have been noted in the context of the ECB's announcement of its monetary policy strategy to the press.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.4,0)">We are all only too familiar with the measurement errors in various price indices which have, of course, become a more serious issue in the current low inflation environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.28,0)">The lack of correspondence between the theoretical and measured magnitudes is no less familiar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.77,0)">For example, permanent values of variables   or expected values of variables   which are in many cases the determining variables conditioning economic behaviour, are not directly observed and must therefore be approximated by some, perhaps crude, transformation of the actual data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Lucas  : "Rules,
