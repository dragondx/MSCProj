    <span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)"> Integration and innovation - The Alpha and Omega of a successful retail payments market in Europe Opening remarks by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central BankJoint ECB/De Nederlandsche Bank conference on "Retail payments: integration and innovation" Frankfurt, 25 May 2009 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to open this conference on integration and innovation of retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This conference, organised jointly by the European Central Bank and De Nederlandsche Bank, brings together participants coming from more than 30 countries of all five continents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">The research papers have been carefully selected from an amazing number of submissions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Together, we will explore how to interlink policy conduct, research activities and market practice in a field of banking that is not always in the limelight, namely retail banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Retail banking has proven to be an area of stability within the banking business during the recent period of financial turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Payments business, which generates about one quarter of all banking revenues, has remained a source of strength.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">At a time when banks’ other sources of income are more volatile, they can count on reliable and regular revenues being generated through payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.23,0)">The other side of the coin is less alluring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.65,0)">Payments business roughly accounts for one third of the operational costs of the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.46,0)">In Europe, part of these costs is obviously related to the current fragmentation in the retail payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Overcoming such fragmentation by means of more integration would decrease the operational costs banks are confronted with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This is the link to our topic today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Against this background, it is no surprise that today’s first theme will be the relevance of retail banking and payments for banks’ profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Mr. Lavayssière, Director of Global Financial Services Capgemini, will make the keynote speech on this theme, and I am sure that his remarks and the following academic session will provide fundamental insights into the economic rationale for the integration and innovation of the retail payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Successful integration of retail payment markets will not only provide benefits in terms of diminishing costs, it will also contribute to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Restoring confidence in, and improving the resilience of, financial systems is of paramount importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Governments and central banks around the globe have made unprecedented use of their policy tools to fight further economic and financial decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The ECB and the Eurosystem have taken rapid and bold actions in response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">These measures have been providing refinancing to the banks well above the usual levels and under more flexible conditions than usual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Executive branches have decided exceptional measures to support financial institutions and help stabilising the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">You may now ask: does it make sense in current times to focus on the integration of payment markets and infrastructures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Does it make sense to invest in the integration and modernisation of retail payments business?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Our answer is: Yes, it does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Let me first briefly discuss how integrated payment instruments, systems and infrastructures have strengthened the backbone of modern economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Second, I will explore how benefits by integration and innovation are to be realised in retail payments business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Quite fundamentally, the availability of reliable and safe payment means for the transfer and settlement of funds is a conditio sine qua non for economic interaction Due to the very rapid growth in the volume and the value of payment transactions stemming from the money, foreign exchange and securities markets, the importance of payment clearing and settlement infrastructures has grown considerably over the last two decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">The integration of these markets is closely correlated with the degree of integration of the underlying payment infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Thus, the effective transmission of the single monetary policy throughout the euro area, the depth and liquidity of financial markets, and the resilience of the European financial system as a whole depend to a considerable extent on the integration of the payment infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.02,0)">The ECB report on financial integration of April 2009 has assessed the state of the European financial integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The segment closest to the single monetary policy, the euro area money market, continued to be highly integrated until autumn 2008, when the financial crisis intensified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This integration has been supported by the high degree of integration of the underlying large-value payment system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">The second generation of TARGET, TARGET2, has not only established an even more uniform wholesale payment service in the euro area, it has also introduced innovative functionalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">In fact, TARGET2 is the first market infrastructure to be completely integrated and harmonised at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In the same way that TARGET2 backed the integration of the uncollateralized money market, the introduction of TARGET2-Securities   will further foster the integration process by supporting the collateralised money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.3,0)">The retail banking segment in Europe, by contrast, remains rather fragmented, as does the underlying market infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.99,0)">Despite the introduction of the euro, payment habits still vary widely across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In some countries, cash is making up more than 90% of retail payment transactions by households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.36,0)">In other countries, cashless payment instruments have driven down cash usage considerably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.01,0)">Likewise, retail payment clearing and settlement is organised differently in the various countries, reflecting local tradition and business preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">To overcome these entrenched differences, the banking industry joined forces in 2002 and launched the initiative to create the Single Euro Payments Area, SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The primary objective of this initiative is to achieve a fully integrated market for retail payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Distinctions between national and cross-border payments should vanish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.08,0)">Practically, one set of pan-European payment instruments should be available to serve the whole market, making national legacy payment instruments superfluous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.8,0)">Needless to say, such an initiative, which requires unprecedented forms of co-operation among competing market actors, may give rise to competition concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.09,0)">It may also get to a situation where the self-regulatory powers of the banking community have reached their boundaries, and regulatory support is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The European Commission and the Eurosystem have been supporting SEPA by closely monitoring the developments and by providing guidance to the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The Payment Services Directive  , which is to be transposed at national level in November of this year, and the revised Regulation 2560 on cross-border payments, provide the harmonised legal basis for retail payments in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Today’s second theme will look at competition and regulation issues that emerged in the integration process of retail payment markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">I am very pleased that Commissioner Neelie Kroes will deliver the keynote speech on this theme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The subsequent panel will focus on the role of central banks in shaping the future of retail banking and payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Unlike for TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities, the ECB and the Eurosystem have chosen not to approach the retail payments market as a system owner and operator – although some national central banks that are part of the Eurosystem have such operational role - but rather as a catalyst, supporting the market processes by using their technical and analytical expertise as well as consultative and cooperative contacts with the banking sector and other public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Tomorrow, we will look at the other challenging dimension that shapes the future of retail banking and payments, which is innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I regret to have to say that while the chip, the internet and the mobile phone have fundamentally changed the way we communicate in the last 20 years, modernisation in the way we pay, be it as large companies or as individual retail clients, still have to catch up these developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Therefore, I am pleased to see the focus on the requirements and expectations of large corporations and public administrations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">I wish you a fruitful conference, and I am confident that it will be another building block on our way to do what has to be done.</span>
