    <h3> Speaker: Peter Praet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)"> A new voice on a familiar topic – SEPA from the perspective of ECB Executive Board Member Peter Praet Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the off-site meeting of the European Payments Council,Brussels, 31 August 2011 Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much for inviting me to speak at your off-site meeting today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">From 2004 to 2010, with only one exception, Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell presented the ECB’s views and expectations regarding the Single Euro Payments Area   to the EPC Coordination Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Today, I have the honour of taking over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">I am committed to continuing the fruitful dialogue that has been established between the ECB and the EPC over the years in the same spirit of openness and trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me first discuss the SEPA project as it stands now in comparison with the situation in mid-2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Then, I will make some remarks on cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Subsequently, I will focus on three issues that are important for the retail payments market in general in coming years: innovation; competition; and globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">In this context, it is essential that we keep up a continuous dialogue with all stakeholders, including that with the EPC, a very prominent actor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">2010-11 review: end-date for migration to SEPA, competitive European cards market, security of retail payments Where do we stand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.38,0)">In 2010, the SEPA project was largely dominated by the intense debate on the proposal to set an end-date for the migration to SEPA by regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">A great deal of time and many resources of both public authorities and the financial sector have gone into shaping the proposal by the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.17,0)">This has not been an easy process, and there has been some controversy between the European Commission and the financial industry with regard to the contents and coverage of the regulation, particularly the technical requirements for credit transfers and direct debits and the direct debit interchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The Eurosystem expects the SEPA credit transfer and the SEPA direct debit, which can comply with the technical requirements, to become the credit transfer and direct debit schemes used for euro payments in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Where direct debit interchange is concerned, the draft regulation now provides legal certainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Despite the controversy, we all share the conviction that determining a clear deadline for migration to the SEPA credit transfer   and the SEPA direct debit   is necessary to bring SEPA to a successful conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Thus, I would encourage you to focus on what lies ahead, and not to be dissuaded from pursuing your initiatives and projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">As you know, one of the areas that needs to be driven further forward by the EPC is the standardisation of cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Last year, Ms Tumpel-Gugerell discussed three elements that are required for a move towards a competitive European payment card market: first, the development of an additional European card scheme; second, the separation of card schemes from processing entities; and third, card standardisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.57,0)">Progress in the development of an additional card scheme has been considerably slower than hoped for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The slow progress in this area gives further weight and importance to card standardisation, which should ensure interoperability and the harmonised use of cards across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Here, I would like to emphasise that the EPC should provide guidance for standardisation initiatives in the different domains   on which standards are to be used for SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Equally important, the EPC should also provide guidance on how to implement them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">With regard to the SEPA Certification Framework, the ECB has submitted some recommendations to the EPC on how to facilitate agreement between the different stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Now that the summer break is over, we would expect to receive your feedback on these recommendations in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The third issue addressed last year was the security of retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Here, the establishment of the SecuRe Pay Forum, which aims to deliver concrete recommendations on card-not-present and online payments by the end of this year, should contribute to the creation of a level playing field with a high level of security in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The ECB welcomes the fact that the EPC regards the prevention of card fraud as one of its top priorities and that it has defined measures to reduce fraud and protect payment data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">However, the market should be more ambitious and follow the Eurosystem’s recommendation to issue “chip only” cards and, in addition, to start with implementing intermediate fraud prevention measures such as the regional blocking of card transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">In this respect, it is encouraging that EUROPOL has called on the United States to close this loophole for fraudulent card transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The recent announcement of VISA Inc. to accelerate migration to EMV in the United States and to institute a shift in liability for counterfeit card-present point-of-sale transactions can thus be considered a real breakthrough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Cash Before I turn to innovation, let me first say a few words about cash, taking into account that banknotes are issued by the Eurosystem itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In practice today, cash is still by far the most frequently used means of payment for retail   transactions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.91,0)">Society is neither willing nor ready to do without cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The continued availability of cash as an easy-to-use, reliable and cheap means of payment requires a resilient and efficient cash cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Indeed, it is likely, both with respect to resilience and with respect to efficiency, that the bar in this respect will be raised in the period ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Against this background, I welcome your efforts in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">The standardisation and upgrading of the cassettes used for the storage and transportation of banknotes, which you will discuss tomorrow, is a case in point, serving both the efficiency and the resilience of the cash cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">I know that my colleagues in the cash area appreciated the constructive cooperation that you have been able to establish over the years, and they look forward to seeing further progress on these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Fostering innovation: 21st century ways to pay 25 years ago, nobody would have expected that the way we work, communicate and access information and entertainment would be changed as profoundly as it has through the invention of the chip, the internet and the mobile phone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.92,0)">However, the diffusion of innovations in retail payments has been strikingly slow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Technological progress, which has revolutionised work, communication and entertainment media, has not had a major effect on means of payment and payment habits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The methods used for payments in Europe are still deeply rooted in the 20th century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.14,0)">There are several reasons why innovation in retail payments is difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Consumer demand is a very significant factor in payments — the response of the general public to any new means of payment can make it or break it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.26,0)">It has often been argued that many consumers dislike change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.41,0)">Recently, the Payments Council in the United Kingdom had to cancel the target for the possible closure of the cheque clearing in 2018 due to complaints from stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Still, we should not forget that neither consumers nor merchants can generate demand for what is not on offer – the notorious chicken and egg problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.99,0)">Furthermore, on the supply side, providers are confronted with the first-mover disadvantage: network externalities, the lack of critical mass and switching costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">These factors make it important that innovation is tackled in a coordinated way and that an innovation-friendly legal and regulatory environment is ensured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It is important that these factors are considered when talking about innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Still, in many constituencies, the strong persistence of cash usage may not be driven only by choice, but also – due to the factors discussed above – by the absence of choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is particularly relevant for the unbanked or underbanked population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Innovation in retail payments might be a tool to increase financial inclusion – not only in the developing countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.54,0)">Absence of choice is also manifest in e-commerce/internet shopping.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.92,0)">The ECB has observed that in many constituencies, the payment instruments offered for online payments are not those most suitable for remote payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To give you a practical example, I would like to mention a web merchant in Germany that offers either prepayment, cash on delivery or payment by Sofortüberweisung  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Such slim choice and lack of competition is clearly an obstacle to the growth of e-commerce in Europe, and I can only reiterate the Eurosystem’s call for the banking industry to engage in the delivery of suitable SEPA-wide online-e-payment solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.33,0)">Otherwise, banks may run the risk of being crowded out by other providers that have already entered the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">At the same time, merchants – both in the virtual and in the brick-and-mortar sphere – should recognise that it is in their own individual and common interests to have a secure means of payment and to adopt the necessary measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Fostering competition: striking the right balance between cooperation and competition I would now like to discuss the prerequisites for fostering competition that benefits innovation in means of payment – and retail payments in general – through SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The Eurosystem has argued from the outset that the harmonisation of standards and rules for retail payments is necessary to overcome the current fragmentation of payment instruments and infrastructure in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Giving greater choice to European businesses and consumers, and opening up a larger market to payment service providers, will boost competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The EPC plays a pivotal role in this process, and therefore also has responsibility for bringing the requirements of the other stakeholders in SEPA on board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It has always been clear that, as a network industry, payments can only be processed smoothly if common standards and rules are available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is also clear that standards and rules should be open and non-proprietary so as to prevent closed markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">But it is also clear that the scope for cooperation needs to be delineated carefully from that for competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The optimum balance between the cooperative and the competitive space is as hard to find as that between efficiency and consumer convenience, on the one hand, and security and reliability, on the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">It is of paramount interest of the public authorities that the right balance is struck between these poles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Generally, it is more efficient to foster competition on the basis of common standards than to foster competition for standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">However, it has to be ensured that these common standards do not end up as being the lowest common denominator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.21,0)">Therefore, public authorities regard it as their responsibility to look carefully into this balance between competition and cooperation, and interfere whenever required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">That having been said, I would like to reiterate the Eurosystem’s support for the creation both of rulebooks and frameworks for retail payments in general and of a framework for, and measures to ensure the interoperability of, existing online e‑payment schemes in particular, provided these are based on transparent and open standards that allow other communities/schemes to join if they wish to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.62,0)">Fostering European direction at the global level In my final point, I will take a further step back from the level of detail of the discussion of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In the day-to-day business, we tend to focus, to a large extent, on the difficulties we are facing along the road towards making SEPA reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">When reading the documentation on SEPA, I have often found the phrase “yes … but”: yes, the indicator for migration to the SEPA credit transfer is growing, but not fast enough; yes, the SEPA direct debit is available, but it is hardly used; yes, the proposed regulation will fix a migration end-date, but it is too early; and so on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Of course, we have to deal with problems and obstacles, but for a few minutes at least, let us focus, for a change, on what has been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">SEPA is an unprecedented initiative to harmonise cashless retail payments across countries, with the added difficulty of replacing existing and widely accepted national payment instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">SEPA is not limited by the borders of either the euro area or the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Monaco are part of SEPA, enabling cashless euro payments under the same basic rights and conditions for their citizens and businesses as in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And the impact of SEPA clearly goes beyond Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">International initiatives such as the International Payments Framework   see the SEPA schemes as a blueprint for developing their own schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Even in China, bankers know that SEPA does not stand only for the Chinese State Environmental Protection Administration, but for a pan-European initiative that they are watching with great interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">All this shows that we are on the right path, and that we have an international role to play in retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">However, this needs to go both ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Particularly in the area of standardisation, the coordinated presence of European payment service providers, schemes and processors is required to ensure that changes in global standards that may affect SEPA schemes, frameworks and guidelines are identified in a timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In the 7th SEPA Progress Report, the Eurosystem identified a strong need for the direct and coordinated involvement of the European payments industry in global card standardisation bodies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In this respect, we welcome the EPC’s presence on the advisory boards of EMVCo and PCI, and the negotiation of Memoranda of Understanding with these two entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Conclusion With the publication of the 7th SEPA Progress Report in October 2010, the Eurosystem, in its role as catalyst, provided analysis and guidance on the way forward for SEPA in the forthcoming period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">In today’s speech, I have discussed some factors at a broader level: innovation, striking the right balance between the cooperative and the competitive space, and the positioning of European retail payments at a global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">To drive the future development in retail payments, payment service providers and public authorities/regulators will have to be able to respond proactively to these factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The three “Es” – the European Payments Council, the Eurosystem and the European Commission – largely favour the integration and modernisation of the retail payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">While there are sometimes differences in their understanding of how best to achieve these goals, I am confident that we have managed, and will continue to manage, to successfully drive our vision of SEPA forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.31,0)">SEPA</span>
