    <span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)"> Careful with   words!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBThe European Colloquia Series Venice, 25 November 2008 Introduction   First, I would like to thank the organisers of this session for having invited me here today to share with you my views on the economy, in Europe and worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.58,0)">In uncertain times, such as those we are currently living in, policy-makers must act with extreme caution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Economic agents and market participants listen to and read our words very carefully, in an effort to gain a better understanding of economic developments and possibly also to anticipate policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.93,0)">Under these circumstances, the safest thing for us to do would be to keep quiet, thus avoiding the emergence of misunderstandings which have the potential to affect the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.85,0)">On the other hand, it is our responsibility to intervene in the policy discussions that are taking place in the current conjuncture, especially if we feel these discussions are taking the wrong track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The issue that I would like to address here today has been raised in several quarters over the last few weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.27,0)">In my speech, I do not intend to attract more attention to it, but rather to react to what, in my view, has been an imperfectly informed discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is important to make this clarification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.0,0)">When a policy-maker discusses an issue like deflation which – rightly so – raises emotional feelings, the reaction might be to ask: “why did he discuss such an issue?” Indeed, when the discussions on this issue began, in late 2002, markets reacted negatively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.5,0)">They probably thought that policy-makers were talking about deflation in order to prepare economic agents for it to happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">My motivation is different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.42,0)">I would like to discuss the phenomenon of deflation because several observers, journalists, analysts and academics have started to talk about it in a way which, in my view, is imprecise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Referring to things in the right way, using the appropriate words – this should form the basis of any sound analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And this is what I would like to do today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is not my intention to influence market expectations about future interest rate policy, but rather to explain how central banks analyse the economic situation and interpret data with a view to detecting risks of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As I have already said in the past, it is much more useful for market participants to have a good understanding of the analytical framework supporting policy decisions, than for them to try to dissect each and every speech of the various members of the policy-making body to detect any indication of the next policy move.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">One thing that I would like to emphasise from the start is that economic history has taught us that deflation risks should be considered objectively, rather than emotionally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.79,0)">On the one hand, the underestimation of deflation risks might ultimately lead to deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.5,0)">Overestimation, on the other hand, might sow the seeds of the next crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.84,0)">What is deflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.69,0)">Deflation is defined as a decline in the level of prices, such as the consumer price index.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.29,0)">This decline has three main characteristics: it is   generalised, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.41,0)">it affects all prices;   persistent, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">it lasts for some time, over several years; and   expected by economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.64,0)">It is often associated with a reduction in aggregate demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.29,0)">An important indicator of a deflation is the self-perpetuating nature of the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.15,0)">The expectation of future price reductions induces households to postpone consumption and firms to reduce wage costs and delay investment, also in view of the higher rate of return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.18,0)">This depresses aggregate demand, which puts additional downward pressure on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.15,0)">The appreciation of the exchange rate might further exacerbate this tendency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">A well-known example of a self-reinforcing price–income mechanism is Japan’s experience in the 1990s, also referred to as the “lost decade”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.24,0)">A deflation triggered by a sharp fall in aggregate demand, possibly accompanied by unpredictable changes in economic sentiment  , which induces producers to cut prices on an ongoing basis, is a serious cause for concern, particularly if it manifests itself in conjunction with a protracted economic slowdown and risks to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.46,0)">This can result in a self-perpetuating downward spiral, in which conventional economic policy options are severely restricted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.49,0)">The financial system may find itself in a situation not unlike the Keynesian “liquidity trap”, where private sector expectations that the nominal and real values of financial and real assets will fall lead agents to cling to any liquid, safe asset as tightly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.08,0)">These self-perpetuating effects may arise through various channels, such as via onerous debt burden, personal and corporate bankruptcies, financial crises or other adverse conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.46,0)">According to the “debt-deflation hypothesis”, first mentioned by Irving Fisher in 1933, falling prices increase the real debt burden and adversely affect firms’ balance sheets, which may result in a rising number of insolvencies and make banks more reluctant to grant loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.31,0)">This leads to a further slowdown in investment, creating additional deflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.64,0)">Furthermore, if consumers expect a further decline in prices and face excessively high and positive real interest rates, this may give rise to a general reluctance to purchase, causing a further decrease in aggregate demand and a further downward movement of the price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.77,0)">In addition, in all cases on record, a sudden and sharp drop in asset prices, resulting in significant losses of wealth, has been a crucial factor in amplifying and propagating the initial disturbance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.71,0)">All the above-mentioned factors, sometimes in combination with policy failures, may add to the severity and length of the downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.09,0)">What is not deflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.43,0)">Not all declines in the level of prices are deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.63,0)">First, individual prices can and do fall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.67,0)">In the euro area, for example, the price of computers has fallen substantially, which nobody has complained about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.15,0)">Even the overall consumer price index, such as the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area, can fall from time to time on account of seasonal factors as well as in the wake of significant changes in import or energy prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.58,0)">The consumer price index might also fall if, following an exogenous shock, the equilibrium price level is lowered and the economy is flexible enough to adjust to this quite rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.22,0)">I would call this adjustment disinflation, which can entail a temporary negative inflation in order for the price level to achieve its new equilibrium level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.34,0)">Disinflation can also be associated with negative growth in aggregate demand, at least temporarily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">However, the quicker the adjustment of prices takes place, the lower the output cost of the adjustment will be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.7,0)">The difference between deflation and disinflation is neither the possibility of a negative price change, nor the association with a fall in output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.3,0)">The difference is that, in a deflation scenario, expectations of price changes become negative and induce agents to postpone consumption and delay investment decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is these negative inflation expectations that push the   real interest rate up, above its equilibrium level, even when the nominal interest rate is brought down to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.83,0)">What could push agents to expect negative inflation, thereby causing us to enter into a deflation scenario rather than a standard disinflation, is unclear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.18,0)">One possibility is that agents are not fully rational and form adaptive expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.04,0)">As they observe the start of the disinflation, since a negative inflation rate is then necessary to achieve the new equilibrium, they may think that this negative price change is likely to persist for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.11,0)">Negative inflation expectations might thus become entrenched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.88,0)">Given the zero bound on interest rates, the negative inflation pushes real rates up, thereby adding recessionary forces to the economy, which might add fuel to the price declines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.4,0)">Another hypothesis is that the disinflation process is not quick enough to stabilise the economy at the new equilibrium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.22,0)">As in the case of asset markets that do not function properly, when the equilibrium price is not achieved rapidly enough and the adjustment process is slow, the price dynamics will take longer and might even overshoot, generating destabilising patterns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.11,0)">The same could occur for the real economy, as a lack of flexibility in the markets delays the adjustment of the price level, thus generating negative expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.29,0)">This scenario might be aggravated if policies aim to stabilise the economy at the “wrong” equilibrium, thereby delaying adjustment towards the new equilibrium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.32,0)">I would conjecture that the more the economy is kept away from its equilibrium, the more the adjustment, in terms of prices and output, might become non-linear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.05,0)">This could happen especially if the classical transmission mechanisms of monetary and fiscal policies are impaired, owing to a loss of confidence in the financial system, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">More work needs to be done in this field, in particular in order to gain a better understanding of how price expectations are formed in the face of a negative demand shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.18,0)">Detecting deflation Although we have experienced deflation in the past, these experiences have been quite rare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.99,0)">Most of us would immediately think of the deflation during the Great Depression, and the recent occurrence in Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.05,0)">The sustained deflationary episodes of the Great Depression in the 1930s and those in Japan in the second half of the 1990s have some underlying factors in common.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.15,0)">Both episodes followed long periods of exceptionally optimistic views on potential output and major speculative stock price and asset price bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.13,0)">In both cases, exchange rate appreciation contributed to increasing deflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.76,0)">However, there are also obvious differences between the two episodes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.31,0)">Monetary policy clearly had a more damaging impact in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.03,0)">As shown by Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz already long ago, the initial downturn in August 1929 and the Great Depression that followed were mostly due to restrictive monetary policy, which added substantial fuel to the rapid and strong decline in demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,7.99,0)">From August 1929 to March 1933 the real gross domestic product   in the United States fell by almost 30%, or 7.6% on a yearly average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.68,0)">Similar drastic declines in average annual output also occurred in other countries, for example, in Canada  , Germany  , United Kingdom   and France  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.46,0)">This contraction was transmitted to the rest of the world via the fixed exchange rate linkages of the gold standard and by “golden fetters” which prevented the monetary authorities of gold standard adherents from following the expansionary policies needed to offset the collapsing demand and a rash of banking panics across the world  ), without triggering a speculative attack on the gold parity  ).</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.68,0)">Monetary conditions also played a role in the case of Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.02,0)">With hindsight, it could be argued that the monetary policy was overly accommodating during the creation of the bubble, and possibly too tight as the recession started in 1991.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.4,0)">In any case, it is now obvious that deflationary risks were not recognised at the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.59,0)">Furthermore, weakness in the supervisory system and ingrained practices in the banking sector prevented the economy from resolving the problem of non-performing loans, with lasting implications for the recovery of output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.59,0)">Although the price level decline in Japan led to a protracted slump, it was still considerably weaker than the fall in prices in most countries during the Great Depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.86,0)">The inflation rate fell below zero in 1995 and then remained negative until 2005, averaging 0.1% per annum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.58,0)">However, overall production did not suffer as much during this period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.37,0)">GDP growth came to a standstill in 1992-93, declining from its previous peak of above 5% in 1990.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.41,0)">Between 1995 and 2007 Japan’s per capita GDP grew at an average yearly rate of only 1.2%, against 1.8% in the euro area and 1.9% in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Looking at the current situation, inflation reached a peak just a few months ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">In July inflation in the United States hit 5.6%, the highest rate since 1991.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">In the same month inflation in the euro area surged to 4% and, in September, consumer price inflation hit 5.2% in the United Kingdom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.56,0)">These high inflation rateswere mainly the result of the surge in commodity prices in the first half of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.92,0)">Since then global economic growth has slowed down sharply and the commodity boom has turned into a bust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.71,0)">The price of a barrel of crude oil has dropped sharply, from a peak of USD 147 per barrel in July to below USD 50 per barrel in recent days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.85,0)">Against this background, the latest releases have shown a significant decline in inflation rates, though in most countries they remain above the respective medium-term objectives for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.34,0)">According to the data, there is clearly no country in deflation right now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.88,0)">Looking ahead, the inflation outlook is bound to change substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.6,0)">If raw material prices remain at their current levels, the year-on-year change in the energy-related component of the consumer price indices will turn sharply negative in many countries in 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">As a result, global inflation can be expected to drop quickly over the next few months, but it should remain in positive territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.09,0)">For the euro area, the latest inflation forecasts for 2009 are as follows  : 1.4% from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  , 1.6% from the International Monetary Fund   and 1.8% from Consensus Economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">For 2010, many forecasts foresee a rise in inflation in the euro area, except for the forecast of the OECD at 1.3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.21,0)">Consensus Economics projects inflation at 2.0%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.55,0)">To my knowledge, no individual private sector analysis or forecast is projecting deflation in the euro area either; this is true, in particular, for the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The longer term expectations for inflation, as measured by the five-year forward five years ahead break-even inflation rate derived from inflation-linked bonds, hover around 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.99,0)">Moreover, the available forecasts and expectations do not foresee any material risk of deflation in the United States either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.38,0)">Overall, while a number of factors suggest that inflationary pressures will decline significantly, there are currently no signs of any deflationary expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">As long as inflation expectations remain firmly anchored, deflation will remain a rather remote risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Deflation and monetary policy: strategy and implementation In recent years we have acquired considerable knowledge on the causes, nature and dynamics of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">The insights we have gained, including recognising that our knowledge is imperfect, are invaluable for policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I will now conclude by summarising the pertinent issues for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">How can central banks prevent, or at least minimise, deflation risks and how can they effectively counter such risks if they materialise?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">By using an appropriate strategy to anchor expectations and taking robust decisions, by employing policy instruments in an effective and credible manner and by ensuring that the markets and the public at large are fully informed of and understand the central banks’ intentions and actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Of course, the conduct of monetary policy should always be characterised by these elements but, in terms of preventing and counteracting the risk of deflation, they become indispensable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me now examine each of them in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">The ability of the monetary authorities to anchor expectations to their objective of price stability is crucial and can be considered a first line of defence against deflation risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The anchoring of inflation expectations can be greatly facilitated by a quantitative specification of the objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In choosing this quantitative objective, due consideration should be given to, among other things, potential deflation risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">When the European Central Bank   evaluated its monetary policy strategy in 2003, it confirmed its quantitative definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">At the same time, it clarified that, in the pursuit of price stability, it will aim to maintain inflation rates close to but below 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">This clarification was partly meant to underline “the ECB’s commitment to provide a sufficient safety margin to guard against the risks of deflation” and also to “address the issue of the possible presence of a measurement bias in the HICP and the implications of inflation differentials within the euro area”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The quantitative definition of the monetary policy objective can help to make expectations of future price developments “mean-reverting”, thus ensuring that they do not depart from the central bank’s stated objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Needless to say, the ability of the central bank to anchor expectations ultimately depends on how effective it is at achieving its goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">This requires, especially in an environment of low inflation and low interest rates, the central bank to use a strategy which provides a robust basis for decision-making and an effective framework for communicating policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">A robust strategy is one that can be expected to work well enough under different assumptions concerning the channels and dynamics of the monetary transmission mechanism, including alternative hypotheses regarding the type and degree of nominal rigidities and the nature and formation of expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The ECB’s strategy combines economic and monetary analysis in assessing the outlook for price stability and the associated risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It is suited to the conduct of monetary policy in an environment of low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Monetary analysis not only serves to “cross-check”, from a longer term perspective, the assessment based on the economic analysis, which focuses on a short to medium-term horizon; it can also provide useful information on the evolution of asset prices and help signal misalignments in the asset markets that – if left unchecked – may unwind in a disorderly way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">A robust approach to assessing the risks surrounding the economic outlook can insure against taking no action or making decisions too hastily, which can both be regretted with hindsight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In this respect, historical evidence supports the conclusion that monetary aggregates can play an important role when inflation is low or negative and the nominal interest rate is constrained by the zero lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">With regard to policy implementation, the old saying that “prevention is better than cure” is also applicable when concrete deflation risks emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The potentially complex deflation dynamics suggest that the central bank should act promptly and, possibly, in a pre-emptive fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">By acting decisively and early, the central bank can reduce the probability that the zero interest rate will become a binding constraint and that conventional monetary policy will become ineffective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">A swift easing of policy may also help to stabilise asset prices, counter a disproportionate widening in the market risk premium and thus prevent a sharp decline in the provision of credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">However, such an approach, aimed at insuring against a possible deflation risk, does come at a cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.32,0)">First, it may contribute to, rather than obviate, a worsening of market sentiment if it is interpreted as a signal that the central bank has made a more pessimistic assessment of the economy than market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.03,0)">In the past, sharp reductions of policy rates have been found to lead to a deterioration of market sentiment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">A policy of insuring against a deflation risk, without clear evidence that the risk is actually materialising, might in fact create a focus for agents’ expectations of negative inflation, thus increasing its likelihood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.69,0)">Second, if the transmission of monetary policy does not function properly, the lowering of policy rates is not transmitted to the real economy and is thus not effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.44,0)">We can see that, in the current environment, rates offered to end users have fallen much less than policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.84,0)">This undermines confidence in the effectiveness of monetary policy, which might aggravate the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Therefore, it is preferable to devote efforts to improving the transmission mechanism, in particular by strengthening the solvency situation of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.76,0)">Third, if all ammunition is exhausted earlier in the process, before there is any evidence of a deflationary shock, this reduces the room for manoeuvre in case other adverse shocks occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">For instance, if foreign exchange markets do not display a major appreciation of the exchange rate, which in the past has always been associated with deflation, monetary policy should maintain some room to counter this undesired development if it were to occur in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.6,0)">Finally, if deflation risks eventually subside, too loose a monetary policy stance can fuel excessive risk taking, which can then give rise to a new asset bubble, leading to even greater problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Allow me now to spend a few moments considering this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.6,0)">The counterargument is that the real problems caused by lowering rates would emerge if rates were kept at low levels for too long, something central banks have been reproached for in the first half of this decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">To avoid this scenario, the solution is not to avoid cutting rates to a low level in the first place, but to raise them quickly enough when the deflation fears evaporate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.6,0)">However, this strategy is not time consistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.46,0)">In order to be credible, a policy of low interest rates aimed at insuring against a deflation risk must affect the whole yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This requires the central bank to commit to maintaining low rates for a prolonged period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is the only way to create the incentive to invest in risky assets rather than holding on to money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">However, the longer interest rates are held at a low level, below the equilibrium level, the greater the need for a quick tightening to reverse the course and bring the policy back in line.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.23,0)">Such a tightening would induce a substantial repricing of risk, however, and a potential downloading of these risky assets from investors’ portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.99,0)">The more agents have accumulated risky assets on the expectation that rates will remain low, the more the decision to finally increase policy rates will produce some disruption in asset markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The experience of 1994 is quite interesting in that respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.58,0)">Thus there is a natural tendency to postpone the decision to tighten policy until there is clear evidence that a solid recovery is taking place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.14,0)">Raising rates too early would be feared to be jeopardising this recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.46,0)">Meanwhile, the more the rate increase is delayed, the sharper it should be to catch up on lost ground,   although a similar problem to the one just explained would still emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.73,0)">To avoid creating turbulence, the tightening tends to be conducted at a measured pace, which inevitably leads policy to be behind the curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.31,0)">To sum up, if interest rates are pushed very low for fear of deflation and then this deflation does not materialise, sooner or later market participants will have to shed the risky assets that they accumulated in their portfolios as a result of this low level of rates and account for capital losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.41,0)">Monetary policy might postpone the timing of such portfolio reallocation, keeping rates low and thus maintaining the incentive to avoid capital losses, but at a certain point it will become unavoidable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.74,0)">The inclination could be to postpone it as long as possible, but the risk then is that when the adjustment finally comes, on top of other adjustments in the economy, its effects could be very disruptive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.46,0)">This story might sound familiar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It should encourage prudence in the conduct of “insurance” policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Although they might sound costless in the short term, the bill might then come when least expected, and with a surcharge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.03,0)">Conclusions In my opinion, the term “deflation” is often misused as a catch-all phrase to describe every kind of negative development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.18,0)">This can obviously be dangerous, as it could lead to the wrong policy advice, much like a wrong diagnosis may lead to the prescription of an overly aggressive medical treatment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.92,0)">The patient may think that this is harmless, and costless if he is insured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.76,0)">But, as doctors know, there is no benign medicine and patients are always invited to carefully read the list of side effects and possible complications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The best contribution that monetary policy can make to avoiding the negative scenarios that I have described today is to be implemented within a framework that ensures both a clear definition of price stability and a medium-term strategy in which the relevant economic and financial indicators are taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This is the way the ECB has conducted monetary policy, also in turbulent times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.36,0)">But this is not sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It is essential that the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is improved, so that the monetary impulse is transmitted effectively to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">This requires decisive action, in particular by national governments, to ensure the solidity of the financial system and restore confidence in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.91,0)">* This refers to the first two quarters of 2010, as reported in the survey in September 2008.</span><span
