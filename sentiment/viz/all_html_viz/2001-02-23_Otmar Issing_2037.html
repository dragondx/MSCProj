    <span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)"> Economic and Monetary Union in Europe: political priority versus economic integration?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.34,0)">By Professor Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Paper for the Conference 2001 of the European Society for the History of Economic Thought Introduction The Hellenistic poet Moschus called Europe the 'other continent', the destination of the fleeing bull with the Princess of Tyros on its back.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This idyllic image marks the birth of Europe as an ideal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">We are now moving into a new millennium in which Europe will witness further integration and aspire to progress and greater prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Will the future be a continuation of current trends?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The recently established Economic and Monetary Union   marks a crowning step in the process of economic integration in Europe .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">This is a milestone and will, at the same time, be a catalyst for some form of political integration for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">First, the introduction of the euro will subject the institutional arrangements of the current 12 participating Member States to many new tests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Second, political forces are preparing for the enlargement of the European Union, with many states wishing to accede.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Hence, the future will not be just a continuation of current trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In this paper I intend to expound my views on the relationship between political, economic and monetary integration in Europe   or, to put it slightly differently, the links between the state, the market and the currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This triangle is fascinating, but also complex, and has many implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Europe as an ideal was always, first and foremost, a political project driven by political decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.53,0)">However, following early setbacks on the political front, the focus turned to economic, and then to currency, matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">After World War II, the 'lead' was taken by economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Over time, economic integration - which became a goal in itself - has succeeded in bringing European countries closer together and has thereby also achieved its wider political purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The higher degree of economic interdependence has in turn justified proceeding to monetary integration on two grounds: to defend the achievements of economic integration and to make further progress in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Now, with EMU in operation for over two years, the issue of political integration is back on the agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is therefore crucial to identify the key elements of this debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 gives the background and puts political, economic and monetary integration in a historical perspective; Section 3 reviews the track record of economic integration, which is the most advanced side of the triangle and the one that has produced the most benefits for European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Section 4 considers Monetary Union in the context of the high degree of economic integration already achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Economists have formulated the optimum currency area   theory, which could serve as a benchmark for Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Section 5 surveys how the euro area fares in terms of the optimum currency area theory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Section 6 reviews the political side of the integration triangle and considers some of the challenges that Europe is now facing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.09,0)">Section 7 contains some concluding remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">European integration from a historical perspective Around the first century AD a large part of the European continent, but by no means all of it, was unified under the political union of the Pax Romana, which featured a common legal system and administration, and a common monetary system with a single currency across its territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">A merchant setting off from Rome on a journey to Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensis or Lutetia Parisorum - the Roman names for Cologne and Paris , respectively - was able to pay his bills with the same coin, the denarius, over his entire journey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This political, economic and monetary system lasted for several centuries, although its geographical extent varied, as did the prosperity it generated: the 'right mix' between a common political order and economic and monetary unity seemed to have been found.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">There was also a common, flourishing culture and language underpinning it, and all these elements reinforced each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.37,0)">Some centuries later the system had collapsed as a result of many pressures, both internal and external.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Subsequently, the European continent was never to witness such a degree of integration again, despite several attempts to unify it - mainly by force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Despite a never-ending series of wars, the fragmentation of the continent, and economic and political disasters, the ideal of a united ' Europe ' of some kind never disappeared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In 1712 the Abbé de Saint Pierre published a treaty entitled "Projet de traité pour rendre la paix perpétuelle entre souverains chrétiens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Ou projet de traité pour la paix perpétuelle en Europe ."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Visionaries like Victor Hugo contributed to preserving the ideal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">There was also a short phase of new momentum after World War I  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">The ideal survived World War II, despite the continent's devastation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The main emphasis in this context was always on politics or, more precisely, on political integration and on creating some type of political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It was also in this vein that European or - to be more precise - Western European integration was re-proposed shortly after World War I  Artis, M.
