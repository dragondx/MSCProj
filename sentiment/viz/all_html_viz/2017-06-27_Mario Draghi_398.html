    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.92,0)"> Accompanying the economic recovery Introductory speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, Sintra, 27 June 2017 For many years after the financial crisis, economic performance was lacklustre across advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Now, the global recovery is firming and broadening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">A key issue facing policymakers is ensuring that this nascent growth becomes sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Dynamic investment that drives stronger productivity growth is crucial for that – and in turn for the eventual normalisation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Investment and productivity growth together can unleash a virtuous circle, so that strong growth becomes durable and self-sustaining and, ultimately, is no longer dependent on a sizeable monetary policy stimulus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The discussions we will have over the next two days – in particular understanding the puzzles of slowing productivity growth and persistently low investment – are therefore highly relevant for the path of the economy and of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Yet as we anticipate the problems of tomorrow, we must also work on the issues of today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For central banks, this means addressing an unusual situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">We see growth above trend and well distributed across the euro area, but inflation dynamics remain more muted than one would expect on the basis of output gap estimates and historical patterns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">An accurate diagnosis of this apparent contradiction is crucial to delivering the appropriate policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.02,0)">And the diagnosis, by and large, is this: monetary policy is working to build up reflationary pressures, but this process is being slowed by a combination of external price shocks, more slack in the labour market and a changing relationship between slack and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.89,0)">The past period of low inflation is also perpetuating these dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">These effects, however, are on the whole temporary and should not cause inflation to deviate from its trend over the medium term, so long as monetary policy continues to maintain the solid anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Hence we can be confident that our policy is working and its full effects on inflation will gradually materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">But for that, our policy needs to be persistent, and we need to be prudent in how we adjust its parameters to improving economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Monetary policy is effective in raising demand Understanding inflation dynamics requires us to divide up the inflation process into two legs: the effect of monetary policy on aggregate demand; and the effect of aggregate demand on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">All the evidence suggests that the first leg is working well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.22,0)">Though the euro area recovery started later than those in other advanced economies, we have now enjoyed 16 straight quarters of growth, with the dispersion of GDP and employment growth rates among countries falling to record low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">If one looks at the percentage of all sectors in all euro area countries that currently have positive growth, the figure stood at 84% in the first quarter of 2017, well above its historical average of 74%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.72,0)">Around 6.4 million jobs have been created in the euro area since the recovery began.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The role of monetary policy in this growth story is clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Since mid-2014, our monetary policy stance has been determined by the combination of three instruments: first, low policy interest rates; second, asset purchases in financial markets and targeted long-term refinancing operations for banks; reinforced by, third, forward guidance on both.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.24,0)">This has created strong downward pressure on financing costs, with rates falling steeply across asset classes, maturities and countries, as well as across different categories of borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Converging financing conditions have in turn fed into rising domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">According to our Bank Lending Survey, our latest easing phase has coincided with a strong rebound in demand for consumer credit to purchase durable goods, while demand for loans for fixed investment has gradually firmed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.61,0)">At the same time, falling borrowing costs have reduced interest payment burdens and facilitated deleveraging, which is one reason why, for virtually the first time since 1999, spending has been rising while indebtedness has been falling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This is a sign that the recovery may be becoming more sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Just to put our measures into context, since January 2015 – that is, following the announcement of the expanded asset purchase programme   – GDP has grown by 3.6% in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.3,0)">That is a higher growth rate than in same period following QE1 or QE2 in the United States, and a percentage point lower than the period after QE3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Employment in the euro area has also risen by more than four million since we announced the expanded APP, comparable with both QE2 and QE3 in the US, and considerably higher than QE1.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">For the monetary transmission process to work, however, stronger growth and employment ought to translate into higher capacity utilisation, scarcity in production factors and – in time – upward pressure on wages and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And this is what we see.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.38,0)">The unemployment gap – the difference between actual unemployment and the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment   – is narrowing and is forecast by the Commission to close within the next two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.95,0)">Surveys of business capacity utilisation are now above their long-term average levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">And inflation is recovering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Between 2016 and 2019 we estimate that our monetary policy will have lifted inflation by 1.7 percentage points, cumulatively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Yet the second leg of the inflation process – the transmission from rising demand to rising inflation – has been more subdued than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.8,0)">How can this be explained?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.43,0)">The link between output and inflation is determined by three main factors: external shocks to prices; the size of the output gap and its impact on inflation; and the extent to which current inflation feeds into price and wage setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In different ways, each of these factors has been relevant for the delayed reaction of inflation to the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.48,0)">Temporary external shocks Starting with external factors, one explanation for the slow improvement in inflation dynamics is that we are still suffering the after-effects of price shocks in global energy and commodity markets, which have led output and inflation to move in different directions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.27,0)">Inflation has indeed been subject to such shocks over recent years, most notably the oil and commodity price collapse in 2014-15.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.57,0)">This not only depressed the cost of imported energy, but also lowered global producer prices more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.16,0)">ECB analysis suggests that the global component in the underperformance of euro area inflation in recent years was considerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.37,0)">In 2015-16, around two thirds of the deviation of euro area headline inflation from a model-based mean can be accounted for by global shocks linked to oil prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.55,0)">Even though the downward pressure on inflation from past oil price falls is now waning, oil and commodity prices are still having a dragging effect – if only because they continue to lack a clear upward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.28,0)">In fact, lower oil and food prices than those assumed in the March 2017 projections are an important factor behind the downward revision of our latest inflation forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.83,0)">Oil-related base effects are also the main driver of the considerable volatility in headline inflation that we have seen, and will be seeing, in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.25,0)">Falling import prices partly explain the subdued performance of core inflation, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This is because imported consumer products account for around 15% of industrial goods in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Likewise, changes in commodity prices feed through into some services items and into industrial goods produced with high energy intensity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.94,0)">As a result, in the first quarter of 2017, oil-sensitive items were still holding back core inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.55,0)">This illustrates that core inflation does not always give us a clear reading of underlying inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.79,0)">Global factors therefore do appear to be weighing on the path of inflation today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.13,0)">But our analysis suggests that the drivers of low oil prices at present are mainly supply factors, which a central bank can typically look through.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And even if supply factors affect the path of inflation for some time, with inflation expectations secure, they should not ultimately affect the inflation trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.13,0)">Uncertainty over slack and its impact on inflation A second explanation for the discrepancy between real developments and inflation is uncertainty surrounding the size of the output gap and its impact on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.58,0)">This might be happening for a variety of reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">One possible reason is that we are currently experiencing positive supply developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In particular, we do observe that, as the recovery strengthens, the supply of labour is rising too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Labour force participation has been growing consistently over the last few years, buoyed especially by increases in participation rates of older workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">We also see some evidence that labour supply has become more elastic due to immigration, particularly in strongly growing economies such as Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Since 2007, the euro area participation rate has risen by around 1.5 percentage points, whereas in the United States it has fallen by more than 3 percentage points in the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Structural reforms in labour markets have been a factor in this labour supply boost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Similarly, past reforms in product markets may also have had a positive effect on the supply side by reducing price mark-ups, increasing productivity and raising growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.64,0)">Another reason why there is some uncertainty over slack is the correct notion of unemployment – that is, there may be residual slack in the labour market that is not being fully captured in the headline unemployment measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.08,0)">Unemployment in the euro area has risen during the crisis, but so too has the number of workers who are underemployed   or who have temporary jobs and want permanent ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.94,0)">This has implications for inflation dynamics, since these people might prioritise more hours or job security over higher wages in employment negotiations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.37,0)">If one uses a broader measure of labour market slack including the unemployed, underemployed and those marginally attached to the labour force – the so-called “U6” – that measure currently covers 18% of the euro area labour force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Phillips curve models that employ this measure appear to be more successful in predicting inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.55,0)">A third reason why slack might be larger is the effect of so-called “global slack”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This is the notion that globalisation has made labour supply characteristics more uniform across the globe and labour markets more contestable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.38,0)">Conditions in foreign labour markets could therefore have a dampening effect on domestic inflation even as domestic slack is shrinking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.63,0)">The evidence, however, is not clear-cut.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.51,0)">For example, new ECB analysis finds only limited support for the thesis that global slack is weighing on euro area inflation today, over and above the impact it has on global prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.63,0)">Alongside the question of the level of slack is the impact of slack on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.48,0)">This is the well-known debate on the slope of the Phillips curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.49,0)">There are indeed reasons to believe that wage and price setting behaviour in the euro area might have changed during the crisis in ways that slow the responsiveness of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">For example, structural reforms that have increased firm-level wage bargaining may have made wages more flexible downwards but not necessarily upwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.91,0)">Likewise, we see today that firms are absorbing input costs through lower margins due to uncertainty over future demand, which would also tend to temper price pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.77,0)">Indeed, ECB estimates show that, if we take into account the unusually large and persistent shocks of the past years, the Phillips curve for core inflation may well be somewhat flatter recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.51,0)">However, insofar as the slope of the Phillips curve depends nonlinearly on the cyclical position, it may steepen again when the economy reaches and surpasses full potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.4,0)">While these various reasons might delay the transmission of our monetary policy to prices, they will not prevent it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">As the business cycle matures, the higher demand resulting from positive supply developments will accelerate price pressures, while firms’ pricing power will increase and the broader measures of slack will converge towards the headline measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.69,0)">As shown in the United States, the gap between the headline unemployment rate and those broader measures typically opens in recessions and shrinks in expansions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.6,0)">Currently, it is converging to the minimum levels recorded before the 2001 and 2007 recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">So just as for oil and commodity price shocks, we can be reasonably confident that the forces we see weighing on inflation are temporary – so long as they do not feed more lastingly into inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.12,0)">Low inflation feeding into price and wage setting This brings us to the third possible explanation for why growth might be diverging from inflation: the hypothesis that a persistent period of low inflation is in fact feeding into price and wage setting in a more persistent way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">What is clear is that our monetary policy measures have been successful in avoiding a deflationary spiral and securing the anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">In the past, as interest rates approached zero, some did question our ability to add sufficient accommodation to combat a prolonged period of too-low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We answered those doubts by demonstrating that we would take any measures necessary within our mandate to deliver our mandate, and that those measures were effective in further easing financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.57,0)">Deflation risk premia, which had been growing in 2014 and 2015, have now been more or less priced out of market-based inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.29,0)">That being said, a prolonged period of low inflation is always likely to be exacerbated by backward-lookingness in wage and price formation that occurs due to institutional factors, such as wage indexation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.58,0)">This has plainly happened in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.91,0)">ECB analysis finds that, compared with long-term averages, low past inflation dragged down wage growth by around 0.25 percentage points each year between 2014 and 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.63,0)">The evidence as to whether backward-lookingness has increased recently is mixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.14,0)">There were signs that indexation had fallen in the early part of the crisis, and ECB empirical estimates suggest that the weight of past inflation in current inflation has decreased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Yet there is also evidence that indexation has returned in some large euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.81,0)">In Italy, for example, backward-looking indexation of wages now covers around one-third of private sector employees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.93,0)">Still, even if indexation rose, it would only create inertia in price formation: it would not obstruct the transmission process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As economic slack shrinks, upward pressure on prices will materialise and gradually enter the indexation ratchet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">So once again we see temporary forces at work that should not affect medium-term price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And this assessment is broadly what we see in market-based inflation expectations today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Interpreting with some caution, they are now consistent with the picture that our policy is effective, but that its full effects will take time to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.35,0)">Accompanying the recovery So what do these various explanations imply for our monetary policy stance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.97,0)">The first point to make is that we face a very different situation today from the one we encountered three years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.66,0)">Then, we also faced global shocks and significant labour market slack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.48,0)">But the recovery was still in its infancy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.05,0)">Global growth was slowing, depressing both import prices and net exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.21,0)">Fiscal policy was less supportive than it is now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.39,0)">And headline inflation was much lower than today and inflation expectations more fragile, creating a higher risk of low inflation becoming entrenched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.13,0)">In this context we faced another risk, too: of permanent damage to the economy through so-called “hysteresis effects”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.36,0)">Given the large degree of slack at the time, the risk was that if output remained below potential for too long, we would see a permanent destruction of productive capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.24,0)">The output gap would close the “wrong way” making the losses permanent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">When we said we wanted our policy to have effects without undue delay, we meant we wanted the output gap to close “upwards” – and before such hysteresis effects could develop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.22,0)">This is why we had to act forcefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Now, we can be confident that our policy is working and that those risks have abated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The threat of deflation is gone and reflationary forces are at play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">And since one of the drivers of inflation today is positive supply developments, this should feed back positively into potential output rather than produce hysteresis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">In these conditions, we can be more assured about the return of inflation to our objective than we were a few years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">This more favourable balance of risks has been already reflected in our monetary policy stance, via the adjustments we have made to our forward guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Another considerable change from three years ago is the clarification of the political outlook in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.8,0)">For years, the euro area has lived under a cloud of uncertainty about whether the necessary reforms would be implemented at both the domestic and Union levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.98,0)">This acted as a brake on confidence and investment, which is tantamount to an implicit tightening of economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Today, things have changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.57,0)">Political winds are becoming tailwinds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">There is newfound confidence in the reform process, and newfound support for European cohesion, which could help unleash pent-up demand and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.08,0)">Nevertheless, we are still in a situation of continuing slack, and where a long period of subpar inflation translates into a slower return of inflation to our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.6,0)">Inflation dynamics are not yet durable and self-sustaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">So our monetary policy needs to be persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This is why the Governing Council has repeatedly emphasised that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for underlying inflation pressures to build up, and to support headline inflation in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This is reflected in our forward guidance on net asset purchases and interest rates, as well as our decision to reinvest the principal payments received under the APP for as long as necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">With reflationary dynamics slowly taking hold, we now need to ensure that overall financing conditions continue to support that reflationary process, until they are more durable and self-sustaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">As the economy continues to recover, a constant policy stance will become more accommodative, and the central bank can accompany the recovery by adjusting the parameters of its policy instruments – not in order to tighten the policy stance, but to keep it broadly unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">But there is an important caveat that we need to consider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.67,0)">Financing conditions are not only determined by the calibration of central bank instruments, but also by other market prices, some of which are significantly affected by global developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.68,0)">In the past, especially in times of global uncertainty, volatility in financial market prices has at times caused an unwarranted tightening of financial conditions, which has necessitated a monetary policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">So in the current context where global uncertainties remain elevated, there are strong grounds for prudence in the adjustment of monetary policy parameters, even when accompanying the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Any adjustments to our stance have to be made gradually, and only when the improving dynamics that justify them appear sufficiently secure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Our assessment of the outlook for inflation and for monetary policy can be summed up in three messages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">The first is confidence that monetary policy is effective and the transmission process will work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">All the signs now point to a strengthening and broadening recovery in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.68,0)">Deflationary forces have been replaced by reflationary ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.17,0)">While there are still factors that are weighing on the path of inflation, at present they are mainly temporary factors that typically the central bank can look through.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">However, a considerable degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for inflation dynamics to become durable and self-sustaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">So for us to be assured about the return of inflation to our objective, we need persistence in our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">And, finally, we need prudence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">As the economy picks up we will need to be gradual when adjusting our policy parameters, so as to ensure that our stimulus accompanies the recovery amid the lingering uncertainties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">For a fuller account of the
