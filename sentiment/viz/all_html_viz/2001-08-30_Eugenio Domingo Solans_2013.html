    <span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)"> Press conference on the occasion of the unveiling of the euro banknotes and their security features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Introductory remarks on the euro banknotes and their security features by Professor Eugenio Domingo Solans, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt, 30 August 2001 PDF file Thank you, President, and good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, It is a unique honour to address you, and, through you, the 300 million citizens of the euro area and many others in the rest of the world who will be seeing the euro banknotes today for the very first time in their complete design.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Allow me to start by recalling that the whole process of designing and preparing the cash changeover has been carried out over the last six years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Furthermore, I should also under-line at the outset of my introduction that a key role in this last stage of the preparation and indeed during the cash changeover itself is going to be played by the European public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">The introduction of the euro banknotes and coins requires both a receptive and positive attitude on the part of the general public and its full co-operation: all European citizens, without exception, will be able to co-operate in this final exciting challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The success of the final euro cash changeover will be everyone's success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The process of selecting a suitable design for the euro banknotes already began in 1995 when the European Monetary Institute selected two themes for the euro banknotes series: "Ages and styles of Europe" and the "abstract/modern" theme, as it was called.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">A design competition was launched in February 1996 and the winning designs were made public in December 1996.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">The winning concept illustrates the styles of seven periods of Europe's cultural history through elements of its architecture, and symbolises the spirit of openness and co-operation in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">You may be wondering why we waited until today to provide final details on the appearance of each euro banknote.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">The main reason for choosing this point in time is that, following the design phase, a range of innovative security features were incorporated into the design of the euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.23,0)">For obvious security reasons we did not want to reveal them too early.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Furthermore, we believe that the information campaign will be more effective and the resources allocated more productive if the communication to the public is concentrated in the last few months of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Our euro banknotes are produced in accordance with state-of-the-art security standards and combine many of the highly effective security features already used in the national banknotes of the euro area Member States with a number of additional features specifically used for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The security features provide all persons handling cash, including the general public, with the means to carry out a rapid, easy, and effective examination of the euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Special attention has also been given to the needs of the blind and partially sighted in order to help them handle euro banknotes with confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In this respect, it can be said that the most convenient features for these groups are also the most appropriate for the rest of the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.74,0)">The seven euro banknotes differ in size and predominant colour, and the value of the banknote is printed in large, bold numbers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The aim of these differences is to make it easy to distinguish between the different banknote denominations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In a moment you will hear how we can all familiarise ourselves with the security features of the euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There are three simple steps, which include feeling the banknote, looking at it directly and tilting it to check the security features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The importance of the security features should not be underestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">An acute awareness of these features will make it easier for each of us to recognise genuine euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Today and over the coming months we invite you to look at these security features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">On 1 January 2002, when you receive your first euro banknotes, you will also be able to feel and tilt them in order to check their authenticity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">FEEL, LOOK, and TILT: these three simple tests will allow us to authenticate the euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In order to illustrate these three tests we will now see a video on how to examine them by feeling, looking, and tilting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let's have a look.</span>
