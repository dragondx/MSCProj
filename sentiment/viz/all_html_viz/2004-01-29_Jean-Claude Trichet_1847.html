    <span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)"> The challenges for the European economy in 2004 Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet,President of the European Central Bank,Conference organised by Foro de la Nueva Economia and The Wall Street Journal,Madrid, 29 January 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you very much for this invitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is a great pleasure to be here in Madrid at the invitation of Foro de la Nueva Economia and the Wall Street Journal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I have been asked to address two issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">First, the state of the euro area economy, and second, enlargement and its impact on the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">I think these issues are well chosen, given that they are currently ranking high on the agenda of economic policy making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I choose to subsume them under the heading “Challenges for the European Economy in 2004”, to indicate that these issues not only require diagnosis but also implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The state of the euro area economy Past and future Central bankers should be looking forward, and that is what I will do in a second.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">But let me start with what lies behind us – I think this is important to put the current state of the economy into perspective and to fully acknowledge the challenges ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.05,0)">By mid-2003, a succession of adverse shocks had held down economic activity in the euro area for almost three consecutive years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.05,0)">These shocks were related to the bursting of the ICT bubble and the fall in equity prices, to the surge in oil prices and the sharp deceleration in global trade, to concerns about corporate governance and yet a further fall in equity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.95,0)">And, importantly, they were also related to geopolitical factors such as the September 11 terrorist attacks and its consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.3,0)">The continued high uncertainty that was inevitably associated with this succession of shocks left clear marks on business and consumer confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Now it appears that the geopolitical and economic tensions are receding, and that a recovery is under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Euro area real GDP picked up in the second half of last year, and the latest information on production and confidence is consistent with an ongoing recovery in economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Barring adverse shocks, the growth momentum of the euro area economy should strengthen in the course of 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">We have of course to remain prudent and cautious as regards forecasting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">However, if unanimity amongst forecasters means something, then the chances for a continued recovery are good: all available forecasts from both official and private sources imply a strengthening in growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">This expectation is also in line with developments in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">I would like to stress also that a number of conditions necessary for a recovery in domestic demand are in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In the course of the past years, firms have made considerable progress in adjusting their balance sheets and enhancing profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Moreover, interest rates are low by historical standards and financing conditions are favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Demand continuing to develop positively, remaining deleveraging efforts of the corporate sector are unlikely to withhold an upturn in investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">A positive sign in this respect is that exports and imports of capital goods between euro area countries have recently picked up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">When all relevant factors are taken together, there are reasons to be cautiously optimistic about the growth outlook: currently available forecasts imply that in the course of the year real GDP could reach rates of growth in line with those of potential output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.01,0)">What about the outlook for prices?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.23,0)">Inflation proved to be somewhat stickier in the second half of last year than we previously expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.76,0)">This had mainly to do with some adverse developments in food and oil prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Moreover, towards the end of last year it became clear that governments would raise a number of indirect taxes and administered prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.68,0)">As a result, the short-term outlook for inflation had become less benign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">But taking together all pertinent elements we expect that HICP inflation comes back progressively to levels which would be in line with our definition of price stability : less than 2 %, close to 2 %.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The prospect for 2004 of growth improving progressively up to potential and inflation being in line with price stability looks good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.72,0)">Let me hasten to add that there is no reason at all for economic policy makers to be complacent in any respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.85,0)">A number of uncertainties are still present in the overall outlook for sustainable growth, related in particular to structural impediments in some regions and lack of savings in other regions of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Also, a no-shock assumption is certainly the most sensible starting point for a central projection, but experience says that shocks can always happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The challenge associated with the economic outlook thus implies much more than a cyclical recovery back to potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">What is also needed are efforts to make the euro area economy more resilient to shocks and to augment its long term growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.42,0)">The case for structural reforms Some observers have raised concerns that potential output growth in the euro area has declined over the past years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Only a few years ago the same observers propagated the idea of a “new economy” and higher potential output growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.52,0)">Empirical estimates of potential output growth - by construction - typically move somewhat over the economic cycle and this should not be confused with changes in the sustainable rate of growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">With the benefit of hindsight we were right to have been relatively cautious when the new economy paradigm was discussed at the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Instead we advocated the idea that whatever the benefits of ICT, they would be best reaped over time by making clear progress in the removal of structural rigidities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Given that demographics in the euro area are less dynamic than in other economies, including the US, we need even more improvements in terms of higher productivity growth, rising labour force participation and declining structural unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">The case for decisive structural reforms is pressing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.38,0)">This is not to say that there was no reform progress in Europe in the past years, just that it is far from being achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Unless Member States step up their efforts they will not be able to achieve the Lisbon targets, according to which the European Union, by 2010, should become “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">For the time being, however, it seems that the US economy has not only benefited more strongly from the growth opportunities offered by ICT, but has also shown a better adjustment capacity during the past downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Let me give you some examples of where I think further progress is needed in Europe to enhance growth and economic resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Most EU countries have undertaken initiatives for labour market reforms in recent years, but more progress is needed in attracting people into the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.12,0)">The target employment rate of 70% of the working age population set in the Lisbon agenda is still far off: we were still at the level of 62 % in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Some countries have started to reform their social security systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.87,0)">Unemployment benefit systems have been streamlined, but in a number of cases, together with high marginal tax rates, they continue to provide a disincentive to take up work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Larger contractual flexibility, such as for part-time jobs, helped to expand employment in certain segments of the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">But further reforms are needed that allow wages to reflect more strongly regional and sectorial productivity differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">In addition, the skill requirements posed by a knowledge-based economy imply that governments should intensify their efforts to improve education and training systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">EU countries made a lot of progress in product market reforms during the 1990s and this is an encouragement to do more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.33,0)">The share of EU Internal Market legislation not yet transposed into national laws is still too high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.98,0)">Progress on this front is extremely important as market entry barriers in the form of national regulations continue to hamper competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.93,0)">Especially in the services sector - where most new jobs are created - excessive regulation persists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">In addition, the Lisbon target that R&D investment should reach 3% of GDP, with two-thirds financed privately, is still far off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The Lisbon reform agenda set in 2000 was both absolutely necessary and very ambitious taking account of the starting point, and it was clear that implementing effectively the necessary reforms would be a real challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Public support needs to be gained in particular from those that profit from protection, subsidies or social security systems – which in modern welfare states can be many.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.12,0)">And this challenge has probably increased during the economic downturn of the past years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.76,0)">On the other hand, the fiscal pressures associated with the downturn were probably a trigger for governments to step up reform efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.04,0)">Indeed, many European countries are currently at a crossroad, faced with the option of either profoundly reforming their social security systems or putting their sustainability at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">In this context, let me stress that structural reforms lead to lower deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Sound fiscal policies imply a strong emphasis on structural expenditure reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Public expenditure needs to be diverted away from improductive areas and poorly managed transfer systems, towards uses that enhance productivity and the accumulation of physical and human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">There is a close relationship between structural reforms and sound fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Together, they enhance confidence and improve the economic situation on a lasting basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">In this sense, the rules laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact are an indispensable element in promoting policies aimed at strengthening economic prospects in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">2004 will be a crucial year for preserving and enhancing the credibility of the institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">As regards the Stability and Growth Pact most recent events, I would only say that the Governing Council shared the concerns of the Commission on the ECOFIN Council conclusions of 25 November 2003 and made it public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and the Governing Council of the ECB respects the recent Commission’s decision to seek legal clarity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">I already said publicly tahtthe Governing Council does not see a need for changes in the Treaty, and the Stability and Growth Pact in its current form is appropriate in its view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">That being said, the Governing Council is in agreement with the Commission that the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact could be further improved, in particular as regards the analysis of structural balances and strengthening the incentives for sound fiscal policies in good times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Clarity and enforceability of the fiscal framework should also be enhanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.35,0)">What is the role of monetary policy in all this?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Ensuring price stability, as well as confidence in the euro is our contribution to sustainable growth, in particular through historically low medium and long-term market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">This contribution is naturally more efficient in an environment where governments, parliaments and social partners make their respective contributions to enhancing confidence and potential output growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">In this respect, there are strong complementarities between sound policies in the different policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">By delivering the necessary structural reforms, I believe that governments and social partners could set in motion a virtuous circle of increasing confidence, favourable growth prospects and success in the reform process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">The ensuing "culture of stability and confidence" would be the best advertisement for countries about to join the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This brings me to the second issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Enlargement and its impact on the European economy In 2004 the European Union faces the challenge of enlargement: its largest expansion ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Ten countries in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Mediterranean will join the EU on 1st May 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These countries together, with 75 million people, comprise a population of about one fifth of that in the present EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">The economic weight of the new Member States, however, will be lower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Their total GDP represents, at market exchange rates, around 5% of that of the current EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The task at hand for the new Member States is to advance real convergence, while locking in inflation at low levels, preserving the soundness of the financial sector and making determined efforts towards fiscal consolidation are all of the utmost importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Overall, the progress made so far in acceding countries is encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.21,0)">The impact on the European economy Assessing the impact of EU enlargement on the European economy is a complex question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Despite the considerable complexity surrounding this issue, one thing that is clear is that EU enlargement will provide new opportunities to trade and investment flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Many of these effects are visible because of the high degree of economic integration already reached between the present Member States and the acceding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Lower trade costs and an increase in competition associated with the enlargement of the Single Market will have a significantly positive impact on growth in the European economy as a whole, even if the effects of enlargement will not necessarily be distributed equally across countries, regions and sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Some economic sectors may gain more than others because of an increased demand for their products from the new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">As concerns the growth prospects in the new Member States, it is clear that EU membership will have a very positive effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Full integration in the Single Market and the impact of the EU Structural and Cohesion Funds are likely to foster the catching-up process in those countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">It is important to keep in mind, however, that the Funds can only exert a positive impact on the catching-up process if countries have a stable macroeconomic environment and institutional and microeconomic structures that are conducive to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Through which channels could EU enlargement affect the European economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I will focus on two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">First the flows of trade, capital and labour, and second the likely increase in competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me start with the flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The abolition of existing import tariffs and the lowering of trade barriers support cross-border trade between the EU and the acceding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">This process has to a large extent already taken place and the acceding countries as a group have become a main trading partner of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">From the acceding countries’ perspective, the EU has become by far the most important trading partner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">The so-called Europe Agreements have been an important driver of trade integration over the past years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">These agreements established a free trade area in many industrial products by removing tariffs and quantitative restrictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Enlargement can also affect the European economy via the liberalisation of capital flows in acceding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Acceding countries liberalised capital movements early in the reform process, anticipating the obligations of EU accession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Foreign direct investment constitutes by far the largest share of total cumulative net private capital inflows to the acceding countries, reflecting also the role of FDI as a financing source in the privatisation process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The prospects for FDI flows after enlargement are very impressive if one considers that private investors are likely to price in a very substantial diminution of risks associated with the entry into the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The opening up of EU labour markets may also entail a flow of labour from the acceding countries to the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.12,0)">Whereas most obstacles to trade and capital flows have been abolished, several EU countries have maintained most legal and administrative barriers to the immigration of labour from acceding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.78,0)">After enlargement, EU countries are allowed to use transitional periods to postpone the free movement of labour from acceding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In many Member States, this aspect of enlargement has been discussed widely and the literature on this topic has been growing strongly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.73,0)">Many of these studies seem to suggest that overall migration flows to the EU are likely to be small relative to the size of the workforce in the EU, though large uncertainties surround these estimates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Coming to the second channel, enlargement will lead to a widening of the Single Market and most likely to an increase in competition both for the acceding countries and for the present Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Taking the experiences with the Single Market as a benchmark, this could reduce price pressures   and enhance productivity  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Together, this could contribute to an increase in the sustainable rate of growth in the acceding countries and in the present EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The size of this effect depends on the implementation of the much-needed structural reforms in both the present and the new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Moving towards the euro Before I end, let me say some words on the adoption of the euro in the new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The new Member States are expected to adopt the single currency at some point in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">In fact, while not yet adopting the euro, they will be committed to striving towards the eventual adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The main aim of the Eurosystem in the process towards euro adoption is to ensure that the monetary integration of the new Member States proceeds in a smooth manner and in line with the Treaty provisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB published a policy position paper on exchange rate issues relating to the acceding countries on 18 December last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This document consolidates into a single comprehensive policy text the previous positions of the Eurosystem on the matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">As the acceding countries differ greatly in terms of economic structure, exchange rate and monetary regimes, and in the degree of nominal and real convergence already achieved, they will need to be assessed on a case-by-case basis throughout the process leading to their adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In this respect, no single path towards ERM II and the adoption of the euro can be identified or recommended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Various strategies may be feasible, provided they are based on sound economic reasoning, conform to the existing institutional framework and contribute to the high level of sustainable convergence which is essential when joining the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The principle of equal treatment will continue to apply throughout the entire process of monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Adopting the euro is an irrevocable decision and it is of the utmost importance that countries fulfil the convergence criteria not only nominally but also in a sustainable manner before they enter the euro area, as required by the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">There will be no additional criteria but neither will there be a relaxation of the criteria.</span>
