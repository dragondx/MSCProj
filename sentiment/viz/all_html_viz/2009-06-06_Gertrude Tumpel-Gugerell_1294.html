    <span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)"> The future of reserve currencies Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBSaint Petersburg International Economic Forum,Saint Petersburg, 6 June 2009 Ladies and Gentlemen: It is my pleasure to participate in this panel of distinguished experts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In particular, I am pleased by the fact that the organisers have gathered around this table both officials from international organisations, central banks and sovereign wealth funds as well as representatives from the academia and the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">We are here to discuss a topic which to some may appear as a technical issue for reserve managers but which is indeed broader as it may have repercussions on the global economy and the international monetary system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me focus in my remarks on the future of reserve currencies on three aspects of the issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">First, I will describe how we assess at the ECB the use of the euro in foreign reserve portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Secondly, I will briefly recall the available evidence on the use of the euro in foreign exchange reserves with a focus on recent developments during the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Finally, I would like to share with you some general reflections on the key characteristics of international reserve currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.26,0)">In general, the international use of currencies is a market-driven process which is determined by independent decisions of private agents and public entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.02,0)">The ECB takes a neutral position on such matters, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.72,0)">it neither promotes nor hinders the international use of the euro or other international currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.13,0)">In the context of reserve currencies, history has shown that the currency composition of global foreign exchange reserves has often evolved very gradually and might be subject to considerable inertia stemming for example from anchor currency and liquidity considerations by central banks reserve managers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Can we underpin such considerations also with data for the ten years following the introduction of the euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.03,0)">The only reliable source on the currency composition of foreign exchange reserves at the global level is IMF data which cover only around two thirds of total reserves and do not include assets managed by sovereign wealth funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Let me therefore use this opportunity to encourage more central banks and sovereign wealth funds to disclose such information – on a confidential basis – to the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The central bank of our host country, the Bank of Russia, even publishes the currency composition of its reserves in its Annual report and I would like to thank the colleagues for this important Russian contribution to greater transparency in the area of international reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Keeping the incomplete coverage of the IMF data in mind, we can observe that the share of the euro has risen from 18% in 1999 to around 25% in 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Since then, if one adjusts the IMF figures – which are published in current exchange rates – for valuation effects, the share of the euro in global foreign exchange reserves has remained relatively stable hovering around 24-25%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Interestingly, this relatively stability of currency shares in global foreign exchange reserves persisted during the onset and intensification of the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In the fourth quarter of 2008, the share of the euro rose by around one percentage point – again, after adjusting for valuation effects  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is conceivable that these latest developments have been mainly driven by emerging market central banks which have intervened to defend their currencies during the second half of 2008 and have mainly done so by selling US dollar-denominated assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Whether one should attribute this latest moderate increase in the share of the euro to a genuine change of currency preferences is therefore not obvious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Ladies and gentleman, please also allow me to reflect a bit more generally about the nature of international reserve currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">What are the requirements for a currency to achieve such a status?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Price stability and the depth and liquidity of the respective capital market are important elements, and the euro appears to qualify in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">For example, in terms of liquidity, the euro appears to have become in the perception of reserve managers the second most attractive currency in the world  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But what are the other factors that finally create a major international currency or even a “currency of exorbitant privilege” such as the US dollar?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Recent research has shown that we can also use standard portfolio theory in order to get some useful insight into this question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">For example, it appears that over the past 30 years it made sense for a global bond investor – like a central bank – to be long dollar since the dollar has been a good hedge for such a portfolio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">One can also use standard portfolio theory in order to explain more specifically the currency choice in central bank portfolios over the past ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In fact, ECB research has shown that for many emerging markets with pegged or managed exchange rates it made a lot of sense to hold a sizable fraction of official reserves in their “anchor currency” which is often the dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The underlying reason is not that these central banks necessarily have to intervene in their anchor currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is again portfolio theory applied to international bond portfolios that suggests that a country with a pegged or tightly managed exchange rate would overweight assets denominated in the anchor currency because they have a low variance in local currency terms and thus carry little risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In addition, a high dollar share countries might be motivated by the fact that the dollar appears to be a good hedge against sudden stops in capital inflows – in particular at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.96,0)">This empirical finding has been documented again during the intensification of the global financial crisis during which capital flows to emerging markets dried up while the US dollar appreciated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.4,0)">Do these considerations mean that no changes to the current international monetary system are ever possible?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As we know, history tells us that changes to the reserve currency status of currencies did occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">And we have at the country level recent examples of countries which hold today more diversified reserve portfolios than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In Russia, the share of the euro has grown in 2008 for the first time above that of the US dollar and currently stands at 47.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">What is important to note here is that the gradual diversification of Russia’s foreign exchange reserves had been preceded by a rising share of the euro in the Bank of Russia operational currency basket which is used as a point of reference in its exchange rate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This process has been gradual and started already in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.28,0)">More generally, since decisions on a country’s anchor currency are typically determined by structural factors which change only slowly over time – for example the direction of trade flows or invoicing practices – changes to the currency composition of reserves are also more likely to occur in a gradual way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In fact, the recent financial and economic turbulences which were also accompanied by some exchange rate volatility have resulted in only in very limited changes to the currency composition of global foreign exchange reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Y., Serfaty-de Medeiros, K., and Viceira, L.
