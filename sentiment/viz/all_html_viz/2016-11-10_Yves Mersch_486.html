    <span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)"> Comments by Yves Mersch at Financial Services summit Comments by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Cumberland Lodge Financial Services Summit, 10 November 2016 Introduction Sustainable economic growth in the real economy depends on the soundness of financial services and their providers; This simple truth has been amply evidenced by the collapse of credit during the financial crisis and the subsequent recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">One important type of financial intermediary are central counterparties  ; Second, the financial ecosystem is – like the rest of the world - experiencing rapid change due to technical innovation; I would like to give a clear signal that innovation should be embraced as the improvement of financial services can boost the real economy; but I also would like to give a warning that a certain level of caution is needed when technological innovations are applied to financial markets in order to avoid any negative consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Central counterparties CCPs are systemically relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.75,0)">They have been in the focus of regulators and central banks since the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The growth in central clearing makes CCPs nodes for risk in the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">This is why we have carried out considerable work at international level to promote that they operate in a safe and resilient manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">In 2012 global standard setting bodies   adopted key risk mitigation requirements – the Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures – which raised the bar worldwide for CCP supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">A global CCP work plan has recently been launched to further strengthen the resilience, recovery planning and resolution of CCPs, which will lead to further guidance being released in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Under EU law, each CCP is overseen by a college of supervisors, involving all authorities that have a relevant interest in its prudent risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The colleges act as forums for information-sharing, ensuring a high level of transparency in the way CCPs operate, which can prove especially valuable in the event of a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.32,0)">Brexit creates uncertainty, and raises doubts as to the future of this framework The prospect of the UK’s exit from the EU creates uncertainty regarding the future of the supervision of non-euro area CCPs that clear significant amounts of euro currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.35,0)">We do not know what the future relationship between the EU and the UK will be, and I do not wish to speculate on this matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.42,0)">We cannot be complacent with regard to the regulatory, supervisory and oversight framework for financial market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">While it has been considerably enhanced and strengthened since 2008, its continued development should be ensured when necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">We are ready to explore all options within our mandate to ensure we can continue to fulfil our responsibilities under the Treaty, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">promoting the smooth operation of payment systems and ensuring the effective transmission of monetary policy, for which the stability of the centrally-cleared repo segment of euro money markets is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Technical innovation Let me now turn to the second point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">How the financial ecosystem is experiencing rapid change due to technical innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The Eurosystem is responsible for operating two of the systems that form the backbone of financial markets in Europe, namely TARGET2, the real-time gross settlement system for the euro, and TARGET2-Securities  , a service for the integrated settlement in central bank money of securities transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">The smooth operation of these services is crucial for maintaining confidence in the euro and to support monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Furthermore, it plays a central role in ensuring the stability of the European financial system and in boosting economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The Eurosystem market infrastructure is designed to meet the highest levels of safety and efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Efficiency covers multiple dimensions: of course it means low costs for institutions that use the infrastructure, but it also implies the opportunity for them to benefit from a range of functionalities that bring added value to the services offered along the value chain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The Eurosystem is continuously looking for ways to improve the efficiency and lower the costs of its market infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">It also considers how best to respond and take advantage of technical innovation and meet new user needs, while staying ahead of evolving risks such as cyber risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">In this regard there is also a need to assess if technical innovation can create opportunities to improve financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Nevertheless, a certain level of caution is needed when technological innovations are applied to financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For innovations to be used in the financial system an essential requirement is that they are proven safe in order to avoid any negative consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Consequently, if and when innovations are proven to enhance the provisions of financial services without harming safety, they should be explored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">ECB working as a catalyst for market integration As a public authority the ECB will keep a watchful eye on technical innovations and assess their possible impact on financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">We do this work together with standard setting bodies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The first condition is that innovations are proven to be safe before they find their way into the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Second, it is equally important to ensure that innovations are adopted to increase efficiency instead of becoming a hurdle to financial integration and efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In its catalyst function, the ECB uses its position as “honest broker” to facilitate the harmonisation of standards among market participants and the interaction of the industry with other public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The ECB stands ready to work together with all interested parties in its catalyst capacity to move towards interoperability of any developed services.</span>
