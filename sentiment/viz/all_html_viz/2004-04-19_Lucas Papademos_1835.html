    <h1> Policy-making in EMU: strategies, rules and discretion </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the ECB Banco de España, Madrid, 19 April 2004. </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Lucas Papademos </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)"> Policy-making in EMU: strategies, rules and discretion Speech by Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the ECBBanco de España, Madrid, 19 April 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Introduction I am very pleased and honoured to have been invited to speak here today at the Banco de España.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Thank you very much, Governor Caruana, for the invitation and your kind remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">And thank you all for participating in this event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.93,0)">I believe that this is the first time that a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank has delivered a public address in Madrid since the terrible events of 11 March.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">I would therefore like to take this opportunity to convey, personally and also on behalf of all my colleagues at the European Central Bank, our sincere condolences and our solidarity with the people of Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.85,0)">We all stand united against these acts of terror, which have resulted in a great loss of life and have inflicted so much pain on so many innocent people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">In difficult times like these, when Europeans are drawn closer together, it is meaningful to focus on values and principles as well as on tangible proofs and actions which define our common identity and can pave the way towards a better and peaceful future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">A specific and important symbol of European unity is our common currency, which is shared by more than 300 million citizens in 12 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">For euro area central bankers in particular, there is indeed no greater a symbol of our European unity than the fact that we now have a single monetary policy and we are all part of the same central banking system, the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">As an important and active member of the Eurosystem, the Banco de España plays a major role in the performance of all the System’s functions, and not just in the decentralised implementation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.27,0)">Also in preparing, taking and communicating policy decisions, the Eurosystem would not be able to function effectively without the valuable contributions of all its components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">And the Banco de España manifestly enriches the policy debate and enhances the performance of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The euro and the single monetary policy have been in place for more than five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The economic and monetary constitution embedded in the Maastricht Treaty defines the EU’s economic policy framework, which incorporates the main policy goals as well as a number of fundamental principles for good economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">These include price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy, the principle of central bank independence, and the need to secure sound public finances for sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">More than a decade after the signing of the Treaty, the “Maastricht consensus” regarding these objectives and principles remains valid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.68,0)">At the same time, the conduct of the single monetary policy and of national economic policies and the interaction between them continue to be debated by both academics and policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.77,0)">The debate relates to several issues and reflects concern regarding policy effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">One issue is the optimal assignment of policy objectives to instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Another is the appropriateness of the strategies employed by the authorities to achieve their objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">A third topic, which has been the subject of discussion among economists for many years, concerns the merits of adopting rules versus exercising discretion in the conduct of policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In my address, I will concentrate, first, on the strategies employed by monetary and economic authorities to maintain price stability and foster higher sustainable growth and, second, on the role and effectiveness of rules versus discretion in policy implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the context of the euro area economy, the assessment of the formulation and implementation of policies must take into account, among other things, the European Union’s institutional setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The single monetary policy: strategy and implementation I will examine these issues by focusing, first, on the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">As you may recall, in 1998 the Governing Council of the ECB adopted an explicit monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">It is a rather novel strategy, one which is particularly appropriate for the special characteristics of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It incorporates many elements of the successful monetary policy strategies employed by the national central banks of the euro area before 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It provides a consistent, coherent framework both for internal analysis and decision-making and for explaining to the public the decisions made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Last year, following a thorough evaluation, the Governing Council confirmed and further clarified this strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">There are many reasons for arguing that the ECB’s strategy is well suited to the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">One argument is that our strategy is rather robust, as it takes into account a comprehensive set of information based on a variety of analyses and empirically plausible models, which help the ECB to take appropriate monetary policy decisions in an uncertain and ever-changing environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.13,0)">Indeed, the common challenge confronted by all central banks is to make decisions under conditions of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Therefore, the ECB, in seeking to maintain price stability, has to analyse all available information carefully and continuously in order to arrive at a comprehensive assessment of developments, of the shocks to the economy, and of the associated risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">In the end, we have to base our decisions on a sound evaluation of the possible outcomes under alternative scenarios about the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">At the same time, to reassure the public that we are committed and able to deliver price stability, we must present the information used in arriving at our assessment of the economic outlook and we must explain our decisions on the monetary policy stance in a timely, transparent and systematic manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Let me elaborate on certain key elements of the ECB’s strategy, which are critical in reaching robust and sound decisions on the appropriate policy stance consistent with our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">First and foremost, the strategy makes unambiguously clear our commitment to maintaining price stability and establishes a quantitative definition of price stability and the policy aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">This provides both a firm anchor for inflation expectations in the euro area and a yardstick for holding the ECB accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">A second important feature of our monetary policy strategy is that it is forward-looking and has a medium-term orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.12,0)">Given the long and uncertain time lags in the transmission of monetary policy impulses to the economy, central banks cannot steer price developments in the short run, and with a high degree of precision, especially in the event of certain disturbances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.44,0)">For instance, monetary policy cannot offset the short-term impact on the price level of an unanticipated rise in commodity prices or indirect taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Consequently, it must be conducted with a view to preventing and minimising any secondary effects of such shocks, so as to maintain price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">The medium-term orientation of our policy allows for a gradual response to some economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This reflects the notion that monetary policy should be made conditional on the circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.58,0)">The precise policy reaction will, of course, depend on the nature and size of shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.96,0)">Supply-side shocks, for example those stemming from disruptions in the global oil supply, may require a more gradual monetary policy response than shocks on the demand side of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Its medium-term orientation also implies that the single monetary policy can avoid inducing unnecessarily high output volatility in the economy, without compromising price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Another key element of our strategy is that it is based on an eclectic analytical approach and a commitment to conduct analysis and to explain policy decisions in a systematic and structured manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In so doing, we base our assessment on two analytical perspectives, or two pillars, which we refer to as “economic analysis” and “monetary analysis”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">This broadly based framework ensures that we arrive at a robust overall assessment of the current economic and monetary situation and the associated risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">An important reason for employing these two analytical perspectives in order to cross-check our assessment of the economic outlook and associated risks is that although, in theory, they can be combined in a unified analytical approach, in practice their integration has not been achieved in an effective manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.84,0)">* * * Some economists have argued that our monetary policy is too judgemental, seemingly discretionary, and difficult to explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.1,0)">To reduce discretion, they would prefer it if the ECB had a simple strategy in which interest rates are changed quasi automatically in response to a single or a few easily observable variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.28,0)">Others would even prefer the strategy to be replaced by the adoption of a policy rule, determining the monetary policy stance as an explicit function of some variables, or by an even simpler rule relating to an intermediate target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.21,0)">Such alternative approaches are, in my view, not well suited to the formulation of monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.65,0)">Let me start with simple rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For instance, under the famous k-percent rule proposed by Milton Friedman in 1956, central banks would have to ensure that some specified measure of the money stock rises by a pre-defined fixed rate each year, irrespective of economic conditions and circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.46,0)">The main problem with such a rule is that it would not accommodate money demand shocks, including those of a more permanent nature relating to structural change and innovation in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.15,0)">This may lead to undesirably high volatility in interest rates, prices and output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.26,0)">For good reasons, such monetary targeting rules have never been applied in practice, at least not in their strictest form.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Several more sophisticated rules have been developed since then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In recent years, the most prominent are the Taylor-rules, based on a proposal by John B. Taylor in 1993.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.78,0)">In their simplest forms, such rules express the monetary policy instrument – the short-term nominal interest rate – as a function of the deviation of a few key macroeconomic variables, typically actual or expected inflation and actual output, from their target levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">There are, however, a number of reasons suggesting that great caution should be exercised in giving such rules an important role in the actual conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.89,0)">First, central banks would not be able to exploit – that is, use fully and effectively – all available information if they were to follow and respond to the developments in just two variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.83,0)">In addition, our imperfect knowledge of the state of the economy and the possibility of non-linearities in the economy’s structure and agents’ behaviour make the normative use of such simple rules questionable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.93,0)">Indicators that are crucial for the application of these rules – in particular the output gap and the equilibrium real interest rate – are not observable and can only be estimated with a high degree of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.76,0)">Recent research has shown that sizeable and persistent measurement errors can impair the quality of these estimates if they are based on real-time data, and that such errors typically lead to a significant deterioration in the effectiveness of such simple rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.61,0)">This makes their systematic use for determining policy decisions a risky undertaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">To avoid the drawbacks associated with Taylor-rules, the use of so-called “optimising” rules has been suggested.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">These rules allow a larger information set contained in a given model to be taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Given the policy objectives and an empirically estimated model which links objectives to policy instruments, the optimal policy path and its response to potential shocks can be derived.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Of course, such an approach, while optimal and internally consistent given available information, is only as good as the model on which it is based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.35,0)">Sometimes, even small changes to the model used can lead to very different results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.16,0)">Such a lack of robustness might cause serious policy errors in an uncertain and ever-changing economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Indeed, a good strategy must perform well across a broad variety of empirically plausible models, and it has to allow for the judgement of policy-making bodies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.75,0)">For these very reasons, optimising rules have also never been applied in a pure form.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">However, they may be seen as providing a theoretical basis for “inflation targeting”, a framework for monetary policy decision-making, which in various forms has been adopted and pursued quite successfully by a number of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.54,0)">There are different views on how inflation targeting should be defined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.01,0)">In its broadest definition, inflation targeting is simply a monetary policy framework that accords overriding importance to low and stable inflation or price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.75,0)">In this sense, almost all central banks that strive for price stability can be described as “inflation targeters”, including the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In a narrower sense, however, inflation targeting is sometimes defined as a framework in which forecasts of future inflation play the central role and are used as the overriding or even sole, all-encompassing tool for internal decision-making and the external communication of policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.85,0)">At the extreme, inflation targeting is sometimes viewed as an approach that effectively boils down to a simple policy rule, whereby changes in official interest rates are, more or less, mechanically determined as a function of the deviation of an inflation forecast from the inflation objective at a specific fixed time horizon, typically of around two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.69,0)">In my view, such an exclusive, narrow focus on an inflation forecast would neither do justice to the intrinsic complexity of the decision-making process, nor would it provide a transparent means of communicating this complexity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.7,0)">Indeed, for these reasons, a number of central banks employing an inflation targeting strategy have decided not to publish inflation forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This includes the Banco de España when it adopted, in 1995, a monetary policy framework based on the setting of a quantitative direct inflation target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">This approach had the advantage of providing a clear benchmark for inflation expectations, while helping to avoid a situation where the public was under the impression that the complexity of monetary policy making could be subsumed under a single forecast figure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.14,0)">A further problem posed by strict forms of inflation targeting is that limiting attention to a pre-specified horizon is arbitrary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.75,0)">Central banks may have to react differently to different types of economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.08,0)">Inflation forecasts or projections, while useful and indeed indispensable ingredients of a monetary policy framework, cannot be the only input in decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.43,0)">The same inflation forecast figures can be associated with quite different states of the economy, reflecting the effects of different factors and shocks, and thus potentially requiring different policy responses on the part of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For this reason too, monetary authorities carefully take into account the specific determinants of the economic situation and outlook as well as the nature and size of the threats to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Such an analysis may require adapting, to a certain extent, the appropriate monetary policy horizon for restoring price stability in response to the nature and magnitude of shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In this respect, it is notable that quite a few “inflation-targeting central banks” have recently relaxed their emphasis on a fixed horizon, in favour of the more flexible medium-term notion, thereby moving closer to the approach adopted by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.55,0)">All in all, the uncertainty and our imperfect knowledge of the state, structure and dynamics of the economy severely limit the usefulness of relying on a single model and on simple and fully defined policy reaction functions for determining the appropriate monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">If monetary policy bases its decisions on just one single equation or set of equations, it effectively assumes to have perfect knowledge of the key structural aspects of an ever-changing economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.82,0)">In a complex and changing economic environment, a mechanical use of fully specified decision rules is too restrictive to ensure an optimal, robust policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.64,0)">Simple rules limit the amount of information used and underrate the need for judgement in the use and interpretation of any economic model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">They are no substitute for an ongoing articulated analysis of all the economic and monetary forces at work in the economy and for the need to check all policy proposals for their robustness across a variety of frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.51,0)">* * * My remarks on rules should, however, not be interpreted as implying that I am advocating unconstrained discretion in the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">On the contrary, monetary authorities need to behave in a systematic and predictable manner in order to enhance policy effectiveness and credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">There are two main reasons for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.15,0)">The first is precisely the same reason as the one which argues against the adoption of simple or specifically defined rules, namely the uncertainty and imperfect knowledge about the functioning of the economy and the monetary policy transmission process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.98,0)">Consequently, the uncertainty facing policy-makers suggests that extremes – that is, simple rules and unconstrained discretion – should be avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">The second reason is the need to ensure that the public and market participants have full confidence in the central bank’s commitment and ability to fulfil its mandate and achieve its overriding objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">There can be – and there must be – no doubt concerning our determination to maintain price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.52,0)">And in order to do this effectively, there must be no discretion in the sense that monetary policy would deliberately try to surprise the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Indeed, predictability is a pre-condition for a successful monetary policy that reduces unnecessary volatility and stabilises inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.05,0)">These arguments do not exclude the possibility that a central bank might exercise discretion to mitigate the effects of sizeable unanticipated disturbances on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.27,0)">Although an activist monetary policy aiming to fine-tune the economy should normally be avoided, there may be particular circumstances involving severe shocks which could warrant prompt discretionary measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Such a policy response, however, should be exercised with caution, and it should be constrained by and fully consistent with the central bank’s commitment to its primary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">In order to guide market expectations and clearly specify the orientation and commitment of our policy of stability, we have announced an explicit monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In addition, we regard it as crucial that the continuous and systematic explanation of monetary policy decisions in the context of our strategy helps the public over time to understand and broadly anticipate how monetary policy reacts to observable data and indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In this sense, decision-making in the Governing Council could be described as “rule-like” in the broad sense that it is based on an explicit strategy involving a comprehensive analysis of all available relevant information, which is then explained and justified in a transparent and systematic manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.49,0)">However, given the complexity of the real world, data and parameter uncertainty and ongoing changes in our knowledge of the structure of the economy, the “policy reaction function” of a central bank cannot be written down in stone, in a precise quantitative form.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There is a need for judgement in the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In other words the central bank needs some flexibility   in the sense that there is no possibility of it committing itself to a fully specified reaction function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.14,0)">The EMU fiscal policy framework The debate about rules also applies to fiscal policy in the euro area, but the relevant arguments and conclusions are not the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Indeed, some rules are contained in the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The usefulness and effectiveness of these rules have been the subject of quite extensive discussions among economists ever since their introduction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.62,0)">And the debate over these rules has intensified in the light of recent fiscal developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">The rules of the Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact have a solid economic rationale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">A sound fiscal policy contributes to a stable macroeconomic environment with low inflation and favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">This, in turn, promotes investment and long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">A sound fiscal policy also creates room for manoeuvre to cushion the effects of the economic cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">And, by reducing the burden associated with debt servicing costs, it facilitates the task of governments in pursuing basic economic and social objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.09,0)">The case for fiscal rules relates to the notion that fiscal policy is prone to suffer from a deficit bias.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">There is no shortage of evidence that fiscal policy is influenced by the electoral cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.2,0)">In consequence, a vicious cycle of increasing deficits and debt can easily set in, which is very hard to reverse later on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the usual setting, in which the jurisdiction of monetary and fiscal policy coincides, a case for some kind of fiscal rule to ensure budgetary discipline can be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In a monetary union, the case for fiscal rules is much more compelling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.25,0)">To understand why, it is worth comparing the implications of inappropriate fiscal behaviour for the performance of an economy inside and outside EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.45,0)">In a country that is not an EMU member, a lax fiscal policy is punished primarily by financial markets, particularly by the foreign exchange market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.58,0)">Excessive government borrowing leads to higher credit risk-premia and greater inflation uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.93,0)">Higher interest rates are required by investors to hold the larger stock of government debt, and the exchange rate is likely to come under pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.88,0)">In a monetary union, the situation is somewhat different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">By relaxing its fiscal policy, the government of a Member State may hope to enjoy the short-term benefits of increased economic activity while the negative consequences are spread across the entire euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.47,0)">Of course, given the “no-bailout” clause in the Treaty, which stipulates that neither the Community nor the other Member States shall be liable for or assume the commitments of another Member State, financial markets may also punish this country via higher credit risk spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.12,0)">However, financial markets tend to react very slowly and sometimes in a discontinuous way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">In view of such incentives, the case for rules to protect against lax fiscal policies is much stronger in a monetary union than in a national setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Rules are needed to defend both a country’s own interest and the common interest in fiscal discipline, and to provide an early warning against the emergence of possibly greater and longer-lasting problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">* * * Fiscal rules are essential for the proper functioning of a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.44,0)">But what form should these rules take?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The current EU fiscal framework is based on a set of rules contained in the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.71,0)">The general government deficit should be kept below 3% of GDP and budgetary positions should be maintained close to balance or in surplus over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">By respecting the “close-to-balance-or-in-surplus” rule, a government can create sufficient room for the automatic stabilisers to operate and help cushion the effects of cyclical downturns without breaching the 3% ceiling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.44,0)">Unfortunately, as we all know, respect for these rules in recent times has been mixed at best.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.48,0)">A number of countries failed to reach close-to-balance budgetary positions during the upturn in 1999 and 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.56,0)">As a result, they soon found themselves close to or in breach of the 3% ceiling when the economic situation deteriorated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Portugal breached the 3% ceiling in 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Germany and France breached it in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">It now seems that the Netherlands and the United Kingdom joined France and Germany in 2003, and the European Commission predicts that in 2004 Italy, Portugal and Greece may also exceed the 3% limit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.31,0)">Thus half of the euro area countries now find that they have no budgetary room for manoeuvre and most of them have to consolidate their public finances during a period of still relatively weak economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.33,0)">Those who criticise the rules of the Stability Pact argue that they are not flexible enough and that the EU should look for a better set of fiscal rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But this is easier said than done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.36,0)">I acknowledge that the rules of the Pact may not be perfect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I would stress, however, that the Pact’s rules and procedures are much more flexible than commonly perceived.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Moreover, we also need to keep in mind that a lot of thought went into the design of the existing rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The arguments presented in the ongoing debate are not new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">They were all known when the Treaty was drafted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.35,0)">Many of the alternatives now proposed were also considered in the past, and it was felt that they involved problems of their own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I am therefore sceptical whether these alternatives would be an improvement on the current rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Economic theory suggests a number of desirable properties for fiscal rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Fiscal rules should be simple, transparent, flexible and enforceable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.63,0)">The problem is that a fiscal rule designed to exhibit one of these desirable properties will often, as a result, exhibit less of another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.03,0)">There is, typically, a trade-off to be faced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.01,0)">This is often a trade-off between what is theoretically right and what is operationally feasible in the real world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And it is natural that academic economists tend to favour the former, while policy-makers, including central bankers, also take into account the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.34,0)">These trade-offs become even more acute in a multinational environment of twelve countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">These considerations only strengthen my conviction that revising these rules is not likely to help us very much.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Having said this, I do not deny that the implementation of the rules and procedures of the existing fiscal framework could be improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">And in some respects improvements have been or are in the process of being made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">A good example is the assessment of the long-term sustainability of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.02,0)">According to the Maastricht Treaty, Member States’ debt levels should be kept below 60% of GDP or at least be declining towards this level at a satisfactory pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">This provides a useful benchmark against which to assess the long-term health of the public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">But a comprehensive assessment of long-term sustainability clearly needs to go beyond reliance on a single indicator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">It also needs to be forward-looking taking into account future liabilities, especially as regards spending on pensions and health care, which can be expected to increase substantially as a result of ageing populations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.26,0)">The measurement of such liabilities is, however, shrouded with methodological difficulties and subject to a high degree of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The Commission and the Member States have made considerable efforts to address methodological issues and to draw up comparable measures of long-term sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Moreover, in recent years, sustainability has been as an integral part of the assessment of Member States fiscal plans in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">This progress is welcome and should continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Ultimately, however, a certain degree of judgement, or “discretion”, when assessing long-term sustainability cannot be avoided, given the complexities involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Assessments of long-term sustainability do not therefore lend themselves to be summarised in terms of a single debt variable that could serve as the basic benchmark for multilateral surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">For this reason, such assessments should preferably be seen as providing additional information, as a complement to or as a means of better implementing the EU’s current fiscal rules rather than as an entirely different or new approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In other areas too, the implementation of the EU’s fiscal rules is being or could be improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.09,0)">The problems now faced by a number of governments reflect, to a large extent, a failure to strengthen the public finances during periods of robust growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.67,0)">In this context, fiscal surveillance has been complicated by the difficulty of identifying budgetary trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.18,0)">And there is no doubt that, in recent times, there has also been a lack of political willingness on the part of some Member States to abide by the rules and to apply peer pressure on others to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">It would therefore help if we can strengthen incentives to reach sound budget positions in good times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">It would help if we continue to work on and improve our analysis of structural budget balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">And it would help if we can find ways of bringing more pressure to bear on Member States that deviate from the fiscal rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">But, once again, such improvements do not require the Pact itself to be changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">They can be made within the existing framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">By changing the rules of the Pact in the ways suggested by some economists, we might solve some problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.26,0)">But we would also create new and possibly greater problems than we have today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">In the end, what matters for Europe is that there remains a public consensus on the importance of sound fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Ultimately, it is crucial to understand that fiscal rules are in the interest of everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Then, it will also be much easier for Member States to follow the rules, as it will be understood and accepted that it is in their very own interest and also in the interest of the euro area as a whole to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Raising the EU’s growth potential: the Lisbon strategy The EU’s macroeconomic framework, notwithstanding current fiscal problems, has delivered price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">But to what extent has it been effective in delivering economic growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.35,0)">There is no doubt that the EU currently suffers a growth deficit, at least when compared to “the other big economy”, the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Since the mid-1990s, the EU has grown at around just 2% per year on average compared with more than 3% in the case of the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This largely reflects different demographic developments but also, to some extent, different rates of productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">But it is not only the pace of growth in Europe which is slower than that in the US; also per capita income is 40% higher in the US than in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.58,0)">And Europe is not catching up – more recently it has even been falling further behind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.87,0)">Some economists have argued that these facts and developments are largely due to different preferences for work and leisure, as reflected in a higher labour force participation rate and longer working hours in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.64,0)">But arguing that the gap of per capita income is a consequence of a general preference for more leisure time in Europe can only provide a partial explanation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.45,0)">In my view, lower participation rates and shorter working hours in Europe can be ascribed, to a considerable extent, more to rigid labour market institutions and the disincentives set by tax and social security systems than to the free choice of individuals to work less or stay unemployed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In other words, I am convinced that with more flexible labour markets, fewer restrictions and lower taxes on labour, many people would decide to work more than at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">And indeed, this would be one important response to the mounting problems related to the ageing of the European population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.19,0)">It is a fact that our employment rates, our working hours per employed person, and our productivity continue to lag behind those on the other side of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Some EU countries have employment rates comparable to those in the US and others can match the US in terms of productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">But none manages to do both.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Clearly, Europeans would benefit from a narrowing of this gap by raising employment rates and working hours, increasing productivity, and thereby raising the EU’s growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Increasing the Union’s growth potential ultimately requires decisive structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">This fact has long been recognised by EU policy-makers, most notably by the European Council when it adopted the Lisbon Strategy four years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">On that occasion, and in the years since then, the European Council has identified a considerable number of measures to improve the functioning of product, capital and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">And there is no doubt that some progress has been made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.87,0)">But there is also no doubt that we are confronted with an implementation gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.01,0)">There is a gap between rhetoric and real action that needs to be closed if the goals of the Lisbon strategy are to be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.36,0)">One of the main difficulties in implementing the Lisbon Strategy is that structural reforms often involve short-term adjustment costs to specific members or groups of society, while the benefits are more dispersed and, in some cases, realised or become more visible over a longer-term horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The implementation of structural reforms therefore requires considerable far-sightedness and perseverance on the part of policy-makers and social partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">It also requires convincing explanations to the public of why reforms are needed and of the significant and permanent benefits they will bring for society at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">One positive consequence of such reforms is that they enhance the shock absorption capacity of the economy and the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Greater market flexibility and higher productivity growth will facilitate, other things equal, the conduct of policies to support growth, consistent with the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">V. Concluding remarks Let me conclude by saying that the euro area approach to policy-making reflects the need to balance rules and discretion in the monetary and fiscal domains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">A stability-oriented monetary policy, sound fiscal policies that respect the rules of the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact, and structural reforms to raise employment and productivity, lay a solid foundation for achieving sustainable non-inflationary economic growth and higher social welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The benefits of these policies can already be seen in some countries of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">And here in Madrid, I cannot help but mention Spain as an outstanding example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In Spain, progress in structural reforms has contributed to a positive economic performance and a significant reduction of unemployment in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Spain also provides an example of how the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact can be respected even in difficult times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">And Spain has clearly benefited from the favourable financing conditions that have resulted from the transition to EMU and from the ECB’s conduct of a stability-oriented monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">I hope it has become clear from what I have explained – maybe somewhat too extensively – that I am not just praising Spain’s monetary and economic policy achievements because I want to be a polite and complimentary guest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Spain’s performance provides telling evidence that we can be confident in the ability of our policy framework – with its combination of strategies, rules and constrained discretion – to deliver stability and growth in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The challenges are manifold, but I believe that we are on the right track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">On such an optimistic note, I should like to end and thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Muchas gracias</span>
