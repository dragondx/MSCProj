    <span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)"> The integration of Europe's financial markets Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at a gala dinner on the occasion of the 42nd Annual Meeting of the World Federation of Exchanges in Amsterdam, 8 October 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Introduction I am delighted to be here to address you this evening, and I should like to start by thanking the World Federation of Exchanges for inviting me to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This said, I must first of all confess that my position before you tonight is by no means a comfortable one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.73,0)">Central bankers are supposed to know all the answers to all the questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.6,0)">However, addressing the stock exchange community at this specific moment in time, I am afraid that it will become all too obvious that we do not possess all the answers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">The developments of the past few years in global equity markets have been literally extraordinary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.51,0)">They have raised many more questions than have so far been answered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, answers to these questions will have to be provided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.65,0)">Risk is an inherent part of financial investment, but I would regard it as particularly detrimental if the volatility in global stock prices were to result in small savers, in particular, distrusting equity investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The diversity of the various sources of finance is essential – especially now, at a time when many firms face difficult financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">The "equity culture", which is still a relatively recent and fragile phenomenon in many European countries, must continue to develop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The same applies to other segments of the financial system, such as the corporate bond market, which have considerably matured since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">This faith in markets brings me on to the issue that I wanted to raise with you this evening: the need for further – and complete – integration of the European Union's financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is a topic that has been in the spotlight more or less since the launch of the euro almost four years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Tonight, I shall try to explain not only why we attach so much importance to market integration, but also what type of integration the European Central Bank   favours and to a certain extent how it can be achieved, in particular by the private sector itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.25,0)">Why financial integration?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">To start with, let me briefly speak about recent events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In the first year following the introduction of the euro, there was some very visible progress in terms of financial integration that could only be applauded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This refers, for instance, to the very quick and safe establishment of the unified unsecured money market in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">In addition, the simple quotation of all euro area stocks and government bonds in one single currency was seen per se as an immediate step towards integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.97,0)">More recently, however, there has appeared a certain frustration as – despite all the ongoing efforts and initiatives – observers seem to comment more on the obstacles to progress than on its continuation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.72,0)">For my part, even though I acknowledge that the current situation is not fully satisfactory, I would not want to take an exaggeratedly negative view on this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.18,0)">Progress may at times be slower than the end-users of the market are entitled to expect, but it is still taking place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">I believe, however, that the particular market conditions that we are now facing may provide an opportunity for an acceleration of the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">The current pressure for cost-cutting and efficiency gains in the financial sector at this particular moment in time may accelerate the movement of consolidation, in particular in the field of market infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Stock exchanges are naturally an essential part of this movement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Integration, however, should not occur only as a reaction to external pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">It should also be pro-active, motivated by a vision of the optimal organisation and infrastructure of the market that can best serve the interest of all its users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The time and effort spent devising this optimal structure may appear to be intense today, but it can yield considerable returns tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But let me remind you why we, at the ECB, put so much emphasis on the integration of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">One source of interest stems from our tasks as a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This has multiple facets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The implementation of monetary policy clearly requires an efficient and fully-integrated money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">It also requires a high degree of integration of the securities market, because our credit operations are fully collateralised, and therefore rely heavily on the smooth delivery of securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Moreover, a homogenous transmission of monetary policy actions across the whole euro area clearly also greatly benefits from efficient and fully-integrated markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Furthermore, our interest in market integration also stems, of course, from our statutory duty to promote the efficiency and soundness of payment systems, as well as our responsibility to contribute to the maintenance of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Lastly, but in my view most importantly, a well-functioning single market for financial services will benefit economic development within the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">What type of financial integration and how   can financial integration be furthered?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Stating why we want integration gives us a huge clue as to what type of integration we want.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Integration must be assessed first and foremost through the benefits effectively generated for users of these markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Integration should result in harmonised access to the market, single technical platforms where appropriate and, of course, fair access to all participants wherever they are located in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">However, it is only when integration results in a genuine increase in competition that it becomes tangible and can provide all these benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">I would now like to address the question of how – and by whom – the process of integration of Europe's financial markets can be developed and completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">To do so, I will take in turn the points of view of the three beneficiaries of the integration process: firstly, each individual market participant; secondly, the economy at large; and thirdly, in between these two extremes, the community of participants in each market segment – for instance yourselves, the stock market community – taken as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Competition The first beneficiaries of financial integration are and will always be all individual participants in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Issuers benefit from access to a broader pool of savings, while investors benefit from access to a more diversified spectrum of investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Intermediaries also benefit from more opportunities for business and from economies of scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Insofar as integration benefits the self-centred interest of each individual participant, it can and should be furthered naturally by the individual participants pushing initiatives as part of an environment of free competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Public intervention: legislation and regulation At the other extreme, as I have already underlined, financial integration benefits the entire economy through the means of externalities from the financial sector to the real sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This public interest – in the strictest sense – justifies public intervention, in particular as regards the supervision and regulation of the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">A considerable amount of work has been undertaken in this field by the authorities of the European Union, under the head of the EU Council and the Commission, to translate at a pan-European level the public goods role traditionally exercised by markets at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In practice a large part of the work has been directed towards the abolition of regulatory, tax and legal barriers to a truly unified financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">These barriers are for the most part well identified, even though solutions take time to be devised and implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Co-ordination within the private sector In between competition and public intervention, however, there exists a third possible driver for European integration, and one which I believe has still further scope to be used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This is co-ordination between private market participants and also between private participants and public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I would like to conclude my address with some remarks on this approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.41,0)">There are situations where the simple interaction of independent individual solutions cannot achieve an optimal outcome, but where public action is not necessarily warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me illustrate this point with one example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">One of the most successful examples of development through co-ordination in the euro financial markets since 1999 has been the establishment of the EONIA overnight interest rate swap market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The creation of the EONIA index, which underpins this entire market, is not a legislative or regulatory achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Nor could it appear spontaneously as a product of competition; it had to be the object of a co-ordinated agreement by market participants, to which we, at the ECB, have provided our logistical support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In this particular case, the immediate beneficiary of integration was the community of money market participants as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Accordingly, the appropriate engine for integration was a co-ordinated action within this community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Let me provide you with another example of a situation where co-ordination could be exploited with benefits for all concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">We have repeatedly insisted that the integration of the infrastructure of the euro area securities market should be driven by the market itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">However, we have to recognise that the costs associated with building an integrated market infrastructure for securities settlements would not necessarily be borne by those who would benefit the most from it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.4,0)">It may be difficult to devise appropriate mechanisms to compensate those who would bear these costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In addition, some market participants may actually benefit in the short term from market fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.41,0)">Even though integration would generate net benefits for the community of market participants, individual incentives to change are missing or are too weak to be effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Under these circumstances, one cannot expect competition to achieve the desirable outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.17,0)">Yet public action is not a necessity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Rather, co-ordination is needed to foster a sensible private sector solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">In such a situation institutions with a pan-European mandate are well positioned to act as a catalyst, as the ECB did in the example of the EONIA market I mentioned before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">However, the initiative has to come from the community of market participants organised for that purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In this context I would like to mention briefly a recent initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">At the end of the summer, the ACI, the Financial Market Association, asked us to host on their behalf a public consultation that they are launching on the means to better integrate markets for short-term securities in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">We agreed to do so because this is exactly the sort of initiative that I have been describing above.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.7,0)">The lack of integration of short-term securities markets, relative to other segments of the money market, was identified some time ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Competition alone did not allow us to overcome this problem, and while public action may be warranted to remove obstacles to this integration – in particular in the legal field – it cannot achieve it alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Co-ordinated action by market participants may be the best means to address this issue, and that is why we welcomed the initiative of the ACI and have lent our logistical support to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.72,0)">Conclusions What I conclude from these examples is the following.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">There are possible ways, in between pure legislative or regulatory action on the one hand, and sheer competition on the other, for promoting the integration of the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">One such way is co-ordination within the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">It is a common experience around the world that where this avenue is used without endangering competition, it can produce the desirable results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Our assessment is that this particular avenue has perhaps not been explored as widely as could have been the case in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">We, at the ECB, are willing to support this co-ordination within the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">I insist, however, that initiatives have to come from the market, from you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Our role is to acknowledge and help to bring about your full potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Yours is to take advantage – both individually and collectively – of the opportunities open to you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Together, we can progress towards a level of market integration that can make EU markets more attractive, more resilient and more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">This would benefit each market user, it would benefit the financial community as a whole and – even more importantly from my point of view as a central banker – it would help to unleash more growth potential for the European economy.</span>
