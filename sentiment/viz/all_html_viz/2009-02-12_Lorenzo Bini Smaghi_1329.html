    <span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)"> Regulation and supervisory architecture: Is the EU on the right path?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB2009 ECON meeting with national parliamentsFinancial crisis: Where does Europe stand?Brussels, 12 February 2009 Introduction   It is a pleasure for me to be invited to talk about regulation and supervisory architecture at this important meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">I think we have an excellent opportunity today to exchange thoughts about these interesting and demanding times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is a topic of special interest to the ECB, as well as to the citizens and taxpayers of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Restoring confidence in financial markets and institutions is of fundamental importance, and safeguarding such confidence is one of the main raisons d’être of any supervisory system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">International fora are seeking to identify and analyse the weaknesses of the current regulatory and supervisory framework, and are reflecting on the improvements needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">The next G20 summit, on 2 April 2009, will play a crucial part in reaching an international understanding on the main elements of the new regulatory framework resulting from the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Today, I would like to focus on the enhancements to the European regulatory and supervisory architecture which need to be implemented in order to restore confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.85,0)">The financial crisis has affected all European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.43,0)">In some, the financial landscape has dramatically changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.2,0)">There is now a broad consensus that shortcomings in the regulatory and supervisory framework have been at the root of the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Restoring confidence in financial markets thus requires a substantial overhaul of the supervisory framework, both at national and European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">These changes call for political decisions, which are in your area of responsibility, at national and European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.57,0)">Various bodies are examining the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In particular, the group chaired by Jacques de Larosière will deliver its report to the European Commission shortly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The ECB has provided input to this report, although I am not sure how its contribution will be reflected in the final version.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I would like to make some remarks today in a personal capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">This might help me to be more direct and clear-cut.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Let me mention from the very beginning, however, that I very much concur with the European Parliament draft resolution on the European economic recovery programme as far as the ECB role in supervision is concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I will start by mentioning three key financial market developments that have changed the prudential supervision environment in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.05,0)">I will then look at three ways in which the EU supervisory framework has been affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">After that, I will ask what is needed, and indicate three main areas of change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Then I will address the institutional issue of where to locate the strengthened European competences for prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Financial market developments Let me start by considering three recent financial market developments of relevant impact to the existing EU supervisory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">First, financial market integration has increased enormously over the last decade, at a global level but also, and especially, within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me give you just a few statistics: at the end of 2007 there were 45 banking groups in the EU with cross-border activities, representing about 70% of EU banking assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">33 of these banks are incorporated in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Integration means greater interconnection and thus a greater risk of contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.82,0)">A crisis affecting an institution in one country is more likely to affect other countries’ institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Second, financial innovation has accelerated over the years, leading to the creation of sophisticated instruments and vehicles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.73,0)">The pricing and marketability of instruments has become complex and interconnected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Third, competition is a key driving factor in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Importantly, competition takes place not only between financial institutions and market participants, but also between financial centres.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is true also within the EU’s single financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To the extent that EU Member States have their “own” financial centres, there is also competition between the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">To sum up, financial markets have become more European, more complex and more competitive, and competition has increased between institutions and jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.68,0)">European supervisory shortcomings Against this background, the EU regulatory and supervisory framework, which is based on a set of EU directives and some mechanisms for cooperation designed several years ago, does not seem to have worked as expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.09,0)">Let me mention three shortcomings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">First, even though we have a single market in Europe, there remains substantial room for discretion in the transposition of EU directives into national legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">This latitude can be used by national legislators to improve the competitiveness of the institutions and infrastructures in their own countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.49,0)">The Lamfalussy framework, which was supposed to promote the convergence of regulatory and supervisory practices, has been insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.88,0)">High costs are being imposed on banks, especially those that have to comply with more than one rulebook and interact with more than one supervisor because of their cross-border activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.74,0)">Furthermore, regulatory competition tends to reduce prudential standards and make the whole system more fragile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The current financial crisis seems to suggest that financial institutions have been more resilient in those countries where EU directives have been transposed in a more prudent way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.34,0)">Second, competition between national financial centres and between institutions is an obstacle to effective cooperation between national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In particular, it reduces the incentive to exchange information on individual institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.53,0)">This hampers the effectiveness of any cooperative mechanism for crisis prevention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.52,0)">It is even more problematic in the event of crisis resolution, especially for cross-border institutions, as has been seen in the specific case of a large and complex banking group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.95,0)">This particular case also showed that the resolution of a crisis of a cross border nature is further complicated by a mis-match between the supra-national nature of some financial institutions and the national nature of solvency aid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Colleges of supervisors have been created recently, but whether they can overcome these disincentives to cooperate is a moot point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Although the recent amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive   strengthen the legal underpinning of the colleges, they do not reduce or eliminate the disincentives to exchange information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.02,0)">In addition, all these colleges create level-playing-field and coordination problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.66,0)">Moreover, the CRD does not introduce clear rules as regards decision-making, which may make it very difficult for colleges to come to a joint decision, especially in a crisis situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Third, the financial turbulence has shown that in respect of both crisis prevention and crisis resolution the supervisory and central banking functions have to be closely linked, even within individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.22,0)">When these functions are allocated to different authorities, exchanges of information are more complex and action tends to be slower and less effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.22,0)">Moreover, the smooth management of crisis situations may be undermined by different views of the central banks and the supervisory authority about actions to be taken, as it happened in a well documented case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.25,0)">To sum up, the incentives to cooperate are weaker in a more integrated and competitive environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.79,0)">This has made the supervisory framework more fragile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.14,0)">What is needed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will not try to offer some instant solutions here, but I will just mention three recommendations made in most international reports lately  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">First, there should be no discretionary interpretation of EU directives in order to secure advantages for domestic institutions and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This can only happen if regulations are harmonised as much as possible, maybe even by creating some kind of European supervisory rulebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The same applies to prudential supervisory practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.72,0)">This means less room for manoeuvre for national legislators and supervisory authorities in interpreting EU directives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Second, macro and micro-prudential supervision have to be brought closer together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The macro-prudential authority has to have access to micro-prudential information, and vice versa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This exchange of information can be better achieved within a single institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Third, national and European authorities have to work in a more integrated way, both in respect of crisis prevention and resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Given the disincentives and legal obstacles to exchange information, the institutional framework must be compatible with the confidentiality of supervisory policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.77,0)">To sum up, the institutional framework underpinning prudential supervision in Europe needs to be changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.35,0)">This requires political will and political decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Institutional models for European supervision If there is the political will to proceed in the direction of a strengthened supervisory framework, two key principles should be restated: decentralisation and institutional foundations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">On the one hand, prudential supervision can only be implemented, in practical terms, at national level, by those authorities that are close to the field and know the institutions well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">On the other hand, there is a need for cooperation and coordination at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Coordination can function only if it is supported by a solid, sound and simple institutional framework, ensuring common rules, standard and practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The design of this framework is important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Indeed, coordination does not automatically lead to results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.32,0)">Jean Monnet gave us an important warning in this regard, when he said: "I have too often observed the limits of coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It is a method which promotes discussion, but it does not lead to a decision."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Hence, the institutional framework must ensure effective crisis prevention and resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It must guarantee the transmission of the information needed to support swift decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">From an institutional point of view, at least two avenues can be pursued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Maybe more, but I will concentrate on two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The first would be to create a totally new institution responsible for micro-prudential supervision, outside the European System of Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This institution would be composed of all the supervisory authorities of the Member States plus a central body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The second avenue would be to assign new competences to the ESCB or to a body close to the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">These may well be medium-term solutions, and take some time to be implemented, but it might be useful to think along these lines in order to move towards a stronger European supervisory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The pros and cons of the various models have been examined thoroughly in the literature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.06,0)">The discussion has sometimes bordered on the doctrinal, if not dogmatic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But pragmatism is the key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">After all, even within countries there have been changes over time, in one direction or another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.32,0)">In all likelihood, there is no perfect system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Even the US is currently considering changes to its supervisory framework, and there are concrete proposals on the table.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.86,0)">I can misquote Keynes and say that when the facts or circumstances change or when new information emerges, I can change my mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Indeed, I have partly changed my mind in the light of experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me share with you some of these reflections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.99,0)">I won’t go into all the pros and cons of the various models, but just make a few observations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.15,0)">In the 1990s, the trend was to separate prudential supervision from central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.4,0)">It was thought that the conduct of monetary policy would be “polluted” by prudential supervision considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">The temptation to try to help some banks with monetary policy tools would be greater if the central bank exercised prudential competences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.75,0)">On the other hand, given that supervisory powers are closer to the political authorities and that ultimately taxpayers may step in to prop up a failing bank, the governing body of the institution conducting both monetary policy and prudential supervision would risk being more exposed to political pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.58,0)">This would undermine the independence of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.01,0)">Furthermore, the negative reputation effects of unsuccessful supervision can undermine the credibility of the central bank and its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.15,0)">This has happened in the past, although it has mainly affected central banks which were not fully independent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">These arguments have been developed in the literature, and in fact were examined in a book written by Daniel Gros and myself in 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.34,0)">Recently I read a couple of other reasons for not entrusting the ECB/Eurosystem with supervisory tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.14,0)">The first is that conferring direct micro-prudential supervision responsibility would considerably reinforce the powers and influence of the ECB, which may affect the balance of power within the current institutional set-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.31,0)">The second reason is that the Treaty does not currently allow the ECB to be allocated supervisory tasks related to insurance companies or financial conglomerates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I am not in a position to judge whether extending the ECB’s responsibilities would affect the balance of power or not, and whether this would be a positive development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.23,0)">It seems to me to be more of a pretext than a real argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In any case, whatever task the ECB is entrusted with, it should remain independent, as the Treaty stipulates, but also accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">It seems to me that over the years the ECB has developed an accountability dialogue with the European Parliament   which has been to the satisfaction of both parties, indeed all parties involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.11,0)">Finally, the argument based on the fact that Article 105  of the Treaty does not allow the ECB to be assigned supervisory tasks on insurance companies does not stand to a closer scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.87,0)">First, it could be argued that such provision would not prohibit the attribution of responsibilities to the ECB as regards the supervision of financial conglomerates, as the related supervisory regime   is only supplementary with regard to the conglomerate as a whole, and does not regard the direct supervision of insurance undertakings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Second, this is not an argument that could support the case for the attribution of supervisory responsibilities to a new European entity and not to the ECB: also in the former case the Treaty would need to be amended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">A stronger role for the ECB?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Strengthening the role of the ECB in the field of supervision has some important advantages which, in my view, outweigh the disadvantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">First, there is no need to follow the normal procedures for changing the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Article 105.6 can be applied if unanimously agreed by the Member States and with the assent of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This article could also be used to address governance issues that are of concern to those who would like to safeguard the independence of the ECB in monetary policy, and keep some degree of separation between the prudential and monetary policy function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.05,0)">If responsibility for prudential supervision were to be entrusted to a body other than the ECB, a change in the Treaty would be needed, and this might take years, as we all know.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.5,0)">In the light of the current financial crisis, it would be irresponsible to wait for a Treaty change via the normal revision procedures to achieve a stronger supervisory framework if the same result could be achieved without it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Second, bringing prudential supervision under the roof the ESCB would ensure that the information-related synergies between central banking and supervision are exploited to the maximum extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Third, it would ensure that supervision is put in the hands of an institution, which has a proven track record, has relevant technical expertise in the house, and has an independent status.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The latter point should not be underestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Fourth, the current crisis has shown the need to strengthen macro-prudential supervision, which concentrates on the systemic components of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.28,0)">It was the lack of a comprehensive perspective which led to the contagious nature of the crisis being underestimated, even in countries where financial institutions were thought to be sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.37,0)">Macro-prudential supervision can obviously not be conducted at national level, certainly not within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It has to be conducted at a level close to the central bank, where analyses of monetary and financial developments are undertaken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This is consistent with the recommendations made by the FSF and other bodies in response to the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It has been suggested also by various members of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Furthermore, it is in line with the proposal in the US to assign macro-prudential responsibilities to the Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The ECB has in fact laid the necessary basis for taking on such a task, notably through the preparation of its Financial Stability Reports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.68,0)">Yet it is clear that the warnings contained in these reports were not heeded by the relevant authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">This shows the authority for macro-prudential supervision should be equipped with the necessary powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The macro-prudential supervisory tasks to be assigned to the ECB should include: the development of early warning systems about the emergence of risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system; the conduct of macro-stress testing exercises aiming at verifying the degree of resilience of the financial sector to specific shocks and propagation mechanisms with cross-border and cross-sector dimensions; the definition of reporting and disclosure requirements; macro-prudential regulation related to pro-cyclicality, leverage, risk concentration and liquidity mismatch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Fifth, in order to conduct macro-prudential supervision, it is necessary to have access to all the relevant information, including from systemically relevant institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This requires the ECB to participate in the relevant colleges of supervisors of major banking groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">There also needs to be a full and proper exchange of information between national and European supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">The decentralised structure of the Eurosystem permits strong coordination between the national central banks and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Any European supervisory structure will have to rely on a combination of centralised decision-making and de-centralised implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">The Eurosystem’s experience can be very useful in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.7,0)">On the other hand, in some countries, like Germany or Austria, where the supervisory authorities are not part of the central bank, the supervisors consider that they cannot deliver information on their own institutions to European authorities for reasons of confidentiality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.23,0)">This does not make sense in a single financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">These obstacles have to be removed rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In order to overcome the disincentives to provide information on domestic banking systems, which arises from the fact that countries compete in a single financial market, a strong and independent institution at the centre of the European framework is needed, an institution which can safeguard confidentiality and pursue the interests of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.55,0)">At present, the European supervisory bodies, constructed on the Lamfalussy framework, have a very weak centre, which acts mainly as a secretariat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Building on these structures does not – in my view - give national authorities the guarantees or incentives they need to cooperate effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusions To conclude, let me summarise my main points as a basis for the discussion today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">First, the European supervisory framework needs to be overhauled, in the light of recent experiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This is certainly the case in respect of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.18,0)">We cannot afford to let this crisis go to waste.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.01,0)">For that, it has created too much havoc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.21,0)">The people of Europe are suffering from the fallout of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">They now expect their leaders to tackle the source of this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Second, such a move requires a political decision, because it entails greater and stronger coordination between national decision-making bodies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Third, coordination in Europe is credible only if it is based on an institution which offers and ensures confidentiality, independence and efficient decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Fourth, there is such an institution today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It performs this role in monetary policy and has performed it in areas associated with financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.0,0)">It is the ECB and the Eurosystem, for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Fifth, it is a political responsibility to decide which institution to entrust with enhanced responsibilities for prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">What is sure is that we cannot wait interminably to strengthen the current system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">My final message is: rest assured, the ECB is ready to assume responsibility for the tasks that Europe’s political authorities may assign to it.</span>
