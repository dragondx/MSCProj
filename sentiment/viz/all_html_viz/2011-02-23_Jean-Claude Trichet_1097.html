    <span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)"> Competitiveness and the smooth functioning of EMU Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, Lecture at the University of Liège, Liège, 23 February 2011 Introduction What should we understand by the concept of competitiveness, what does it mean in particular for the euro area – and how should we act upon it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">These are the questions I would like to explore with you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.7,0)">They are questions I have been contemplating all my life as an economic policy-maker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And they are questions that are central to the future of the national economies of Europe – and of particular importance among those that constitute our Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Competitiveness is a difficult idea to nail down decisively and is commonly used to depict very different things – from securing export market shares, through taxation of corporate profits, indexation of wages and investment in high-tech, to boosting productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">In my view, the appropriate definition of competitiveness is a country’s ability to achieve sustainable improvements in the economic living standards and job opportunities of its citizens in an open economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Therefore, competitiveness is about the entirety of our economic lives in a time of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">It is obvious that being successful in terms of price and cost competitiveness is one key condition for enhancing living standards and job creation in open economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Exports are naturally an important part of the picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">But all sectors of our economies are involved in competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.58,0)">Public goods and services – and private goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.87,0)">Tradable goods and services – and non-tradable goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Financial services firms – firms active in all parts of the real economy – and households and governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">As diverse and multifaceted as our countries are, as manifold are the means of achieving sustainable long-term economic growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The objective of achieving sustainable long-term growth in an open economy is both European and global.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It has to do with the thriving of nations within Europe, as well as within the global economy that is undergoing very rapid structural changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The European Union is the world’s largest economy and trading partner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">It is therefore very appropriate that it has designed its own strategy of developing its growth potential in tomorrow’s global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This strategy, called Europe 2020, is focusing on three main areas: education, research and innovation; resource efficiency; and high employment and social cohesion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">These elements are all relevant for Europe’s competitiveness in a global economy, and the ECB fully supports the Europe 2020 strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Today, I would like to focus on the aspect of competitiveness that is internal to Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.94,0)">the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In such a union, competitiveness must be examined at national levels, with a view to take into account in particular the very high level of interdependence between economies created by the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Therefore, competitiveness is not only about raising our economic living standards: it is also about strengthening the cohesion of the economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I will therefore focus my remarks on what arrangements of competitiveness surveillance we need in the euro area, and how this could be further enshrined in the current economic governance framework that is examined by the EU Council and the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In an economic and monetary union, it is of the essence, by implementing sound economic and fiscal policies, to avoid too large and too sustained divergences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">That is why the Treaty devotes an entire chapter to the “economic policies” of the union, with a particular focus on countries that have adopted the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In an economic and monetary union, the Member States must develop and share a common economic understanding of mutual surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">This common understanding of the implications of being members of a currency union should ensure that structural features of the economies help them to preserve their relative competitive position in an open environment while ensuring collective stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Such collective stability, as opposed to sustained and large imbalances, implies in particular that macroeconomic policies need to be fully consistent with a stability-oriented monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I should emphasise that this in no way means that competitiveness or avoiding internal imbalances is about making everybody look the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">The economic diversity that we enjoy in Europe is an asset that we should seek to strengthen rather than dissipate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">What matters, however, is that diversity does not lead to large, persistent divergences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">To prevent such divergences from arising, we need a common framework that ensures that all Member States – within their specific national settings – stay committed to regain, when necessary, consolidate and preserve their relative competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.75,0)">Misguided national economic policies can lead to the emergence of excessive competitiveness gaps between the members of the currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.56,0)">The primary symptoms of such competitive gaps are usually mounting current account deficits, significant accumulated differences in indicators of price and cost competitiveness, leading, in particular, to inflation rates persistently above the euro area common objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.0,0)">Such developments are also associated with tensions, painful adjustment processes and spillovers for other members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is for these reasons that the European Central Bank   regularly provides analysis and insight into the importance of competitiveness for Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Indeed, it is now five and a half years since the ECB injected an analysis of relative competitiveness into the European policy surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.58,0)">When, around 2005, the signs of imbalances and divergences in key nominal developments, in particular in prices, costs and wages, started to accumulate significantly, the Governing Council sent the first analysis to the Eurogroup.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The focus was on price and cost developments in individual countries; the message was one of divergence that warranted interpretation, assessment and policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">At the same time, an ESCB Task Force was set up to look more deeply into competitiveness issues of the individual euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Ever since, the ECB has provided updates of the analysis to the Eurogroup.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The information on unit labour costs, productivity and sectoral wage developments in euro area countries have become a recurrent theme distributed at these meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Since 2007, the ECB has undertaken regular, comprehensive competitiveness reviews of developments in individual euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">And in 2010, the ECB provided a detailed outline of how the Governing Council envisages a competitiveness framework for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In my remarks tonight, I would like to focus on the main issues at stake – for national economies in general and for members of the euro area in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">I will begin by reminding you of some of the stylised facts that have characterised economic developments in the euro area over the past 12 years, as well as some of the fallacies about competitiveness that I have encountered over the years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">I will then outline the key elements of a framework for analysis and action on competitiveness, and subsequently discuss the implications for the current proposals on the strengthening of macroeconomic surveillance from a euro area perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I  Afonso, A. and P.
