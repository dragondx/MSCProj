    <h3> Speaker: Lucas Papademos </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)"> Opening remarks at the press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the December 2008 ECB Financial Stability Review Speech by Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 15 December 2008 I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Introduction My colleagues and I would like to welcome you to today’s press briefing on the occasion of the publication of the December 2008 edition of the ECB Financial Stability Review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The financial stability assessment contained in the Review has been prepared with the close involvement of the ESCB Banking Supervision Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.46,0)">It is for the most part based on information that was available up until the “cut-off” date of 28 November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The Review examines in some detail the main trends and events that characterised the euro area financial system over the past six months and it contains 14 boxes and five special feature articles that address topical financial stability issues in a more focused and analytical manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The central objective of the ECB Financial Stability Review is to identify the main sources of risk and vulnerability to financial system stability and to provide a comprehensive assessment of the capacity of the euro area financial system to absorb adverse disturbances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">For this edition of the Review, we made an additional effort to provide a summary that makes the key messages of our analysis more accessible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In my presentation, I will broadly follow this summary, but also provide additional explanations on some of the most topical issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.41,0)">I will start with a brief review of the overall impact of the financial market turmoil on the global banking system and the current macroeconomic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.88,0)">I will then examine the risks and vulnerabilities in:   the global macro-financial environment;   the euro area corporate and household sectors and;   the euro area financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Finally, I will conclude with our overall assessment of risks to euro area financial stability in the period ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.59,0)">The financial market turmoil: overview Since the publication of the previous Financial Stability Review in June 2008, the financial crisis has intensified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.52,0)">Banks had to absorb further asset valuation write-downs in an environment where wholesale funding costs remained elevated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.08,0)">At the same time, the global economic outlook deteriorated and became more uncertain, risk aversion among financial market participants surged, and the prices of most financial assets fell.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.49,0)">The persistent liquidity stresses in the early phases of the turmoil eventually gave way to deeper concerns about creditworthiness and the adequacy of capital buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.8,0)">Following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, investors and creditors lost confidence in the ability of some financial firms to meet their obligations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.29,0)">As a result, many key financial firms faced mounting challenges in accessing short-term funding and capital markets, which triggered sharp drops in their stock prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.8,0)">Some of the world’s largest financial institutions were affected by this adverse dynamic and a number of them were ultimately declared bankrupt, purchased by other financial institutions, or provided with government support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Central banks and governments have taken extraordinary remedial actions, which aim at addressing liquidity stresses and strengthening capital positions, thus contributing to restoring confidence in and improving the resilience of financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">These measures have succeeded in stabilising the euro area banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Over time, as some government measures are being fully implemented, they should contribute to lowering funding costs of banks and facilitate the provision of credit to the broader economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.89,0)">After these introductory remarks, let me first present the latest available figures regarding the total turmoil-related income losses and the new capital raised by major global banks since the beginning of the second quarter of 2007 up to and including the third quarter of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.63,0)">Over this period, the total mark-to-market losses amounted to USD 720 billion globally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.89,0)">This figure includes losses related to holdings of structured finance instruments and mortgages which are reflected either in net income or in the value of equity or in other comprehensive income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">As shown in  3 billion, which represented 18% of the global amount.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.6,0)">North American banks bore the bulk   of the global mark-to-market losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Within the same period, major global banks raised USD 765 billion in new capital, that is, more than the losses reported  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The capital raised includes common stock, preferred stock, and hybrid securities that are accepted as capital by regulators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The share of European banks in the total new capital raised globally is 39% and that of euro area financial institutions is 18%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">These shares are, respectively, somewhat higher or the same as the corresponding figures for the total losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.07,0)">However, bank losses in the euro area seem to be more widely spread across individual institutions than is the case in the US and other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.4,0)">This notwithstanding, the intense stresses that emerged after the failure of Lehman Brothers raised serious doubts among investors about the asset quality and the adequacy of the capital buffers of some euro area institutions and resulted in an abrupt and significant deterioration in money market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Consequently, government and central bank actions were necessary to help stabilise the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.01,0)">Since September this year, tensions have increasingly spilled over from the financial sector to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.76,0)">In the euro area, a number of the downside risks to economic activity that had been previousely identified materialised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.8,0)">The significant weakening of economic activity could have a negative effect on borrowers’ ability to service their debt and thus on the credit risk faced by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">According to the December 2008 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections for the euro area, global economic weakness will persist in the coming quarters; thereafter we expect a gradual recovery, supported by the fall in commodity prices and assuming that the external environment improves and the financial tensions weaken  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.1,0)">Sources of risk and vulnerability This leads me to the second part of my presentation that focuses on the main sources of risk and vulnerability that may affect the euro area financial stability outlook over the next six to twelve months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">III.1 The global macro-financial environment Let me start with the risks and vulnerabilities we have identified in the global macro-financial environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.89,0)">Global imbalances, notably the persistently large US current account deficits and the recycling of surpluses from emerging Asia and oil-exporting countries continue to pose substantial risks to global financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The cumulated net capital inflows to the United States remained relatively stable  , because the lower capital inflows from private investors were counterbalanced by important official inflows stemming from the continued accumulation of foreign exchange reserves by major oil exporters and other surplus economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.96,0)">Another important source of risk stems from the US housing market which has been the epicentre of the financial market stresses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.64,0)">The outlook for US house prices is shown on   The narrow index which measures developments in the largest US cities, also indicates that house prices are expected to drop to a level that is more than 30% below the peak recorded in mid-2006, before they start to stabilise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.38,0)">Estimates of the existing excess supply in the housing markets put the housing overhang at around 1 million houses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.05,0)">At the current rate of housing starts, it would take up to two years to eliminate the excess supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Box I of the Review provides a more in-depth assessment of the current and expected future valuations in the US housing markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.59,0)">At the same time, the outlook for the US corporate sector has, on balance, also weakened substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.63,0)">By mid-September, corporate profits growth and default rates had already deteriorated rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.0,0)">As financing conditions have tightened significantly, even some of the largest corporations have reported shortages of cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.93,0)">As shown in   A further source of risks to financial stability has been the continued worsening of the average hedge fund investment performance amid prolonged and heightened financial market volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.44,0)">During times of stress, many hedge funds reduced risk-taking and instead concentrated on capital preservation, either voluntarily, or due to the reduced availability of bank funding and investor withdrawals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.67,0)">The deleveraging in the hedge fund sector has been widespread and rapid as illustrated in   In a context of global de-leveraging and mounting risk aversion, foreign investors also markedly reduced their exposures to emerging market financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.57,0)">Persistent turbulence in financial markets weighed on those emerging economies that rely on external financing to fund their current account deficits, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">This is of relevance for financial stability also in the euro area because of the sizeable cross-border exposures of European banks vis-à-vis new EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.34,0)">The pertinent facts and potential risks are presented in Box 2 of the Review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The share of assets in new EU Member States was the highest for banks in Austria, Greece, Sweden, Belgium and Italy, while other euro area countries were less exposed  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In 2007, the growth of euro area banks’ assets in this region was, on average, 35 percentage points higher than their total asset growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Furthermore, given the higher profit margins that can be realised in the banking markets of new EU Member States the contribution of some euro area banks’ subsidiaries in the new EU Member States to group profits have been substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.28,0)">Some large banks that are active in the region could, therefore, be negatively affected if macroeconomic conditions in new EU members were to deteriorate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.99,0)">III.2 The euro area corporate and household sectors In the euro area household sector, pockets of vulnerability may have grown in the mortgage markets, mostly stemming from developments in income and house prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Regarding the latter,   Box 5 of the Review analyses developments in selected euro area housing markets using a dynamic asset pricing model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.14,0)">The main findings are, first, that while the bulk of the variability of house price movements can be attributed to changes in rental yields, a generalised decline in expected returns on housing investments may permeate the housing markets of all euro area countries, irrespective of the evolution of fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.89,0)">A further interesting finding of this analysis is that house prices tend to overreact to news, especially when fundamentals are deteriorating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.77,0)">While the ongoing slowdown in the annual growth rate of euro area residential property prices has remained gradual so far, the possibility of a market overreaction to negative news might well apply to house price dynamics in some regions at the present juncture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Euro area non-financial corporations tend to exhibit, at present, stronger balance sheets than just before the last credit cycle downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.51,0)">However, their operating environment has become more challenging and less favourable than six months ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.92,0)">In the near term, balance sheets are likely to deteriorate due to the expected slowdown of earnings growth, in an environment of weak economic activity, persisting high leverage, and difficult funding conditions for the corporate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.82,0)">Reflecting this outlook,   In most euro area countries, commercial property inflation continued to decline in the first three quarters of 2008, and prices were even falling in seven out of the 12 countries for which data are available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.19,0)">Prices were affected by reduced commercial property investment activity in the latter part of 2007 and in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.15,0)">Funding costs and risks have also grown, raising costs for leveraged property investors and, in turn, contributing to the observed negative price dynamics in some markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.78,0)">III.3 The euro area financial system Turning to the euro area financial system, conditions in the euro area and other major money markets deteriorated significantly in mid-September, as the default of Lehman Brothers fuelled concerns about counterparty credit risk and challenged the widely-held view that any large bank, which was considered too big or too interconnected to fail, would be supported by public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.16,0)">This event triggered a sharp increase in the spreads between Euribor and EONIA swap rates across all maturities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.4,0)">Banks hoarded liquidity   in view of growing concerns about the creditworthiness of counterparties and heightened uncertainty about their own liquidity positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Conditions in money markets in other advanced economies exhibited similar developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Since mid-September, central banks have stepped up the already remarkable levels of cooperation and provided liquidity in coordinated actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Moreover, the ECB and also other central banks have made extensive efforts to provide refinancing at longer maturities and to expand the lists of assets that are eligible as collateral in credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Not least thanks to these actions, the recent weeks have seen a noticeable improvement in the euro money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.63,0)">For example, in the past week, the spreads between term deposit and overnight index swap rates declined considerably, by 15 to 20 basis points along all maturities, reflecting the continued fall in the Euribor rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.33,0)">The spreads fell to 80 basis points for the one-month maturity and 160 basis points for the 12-month maturity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">An interesting analysis related to the current problems in the money markets is presented in Box 7 of the Review which highlights the link between market liquidity and funding liquidity risk, on the basis of evidence from recent data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.68,0)">The results show that a negative relationship between high funding liquidity risk and low market liquidity was established only after the financial turmoil had erupted, while in “normal” times, there is no obvious relationship between the two measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.05,0)">This supports the theoretical proposition   that interactions between the two measures emerge only when banks face funding constraints, that is, when shocks to banks’ funding liquidity can lead to forced asset sales and may depress asset prices, with dire consequences for market liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.36,0)">The tensions in the money market, and more generally the fallout from the financial crisis, have had a significant negative impact on large and complex banking groups in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.32,0)">In the first three quarters of 2008, their profitability suffered further due to the unfavourable financial market conditions and, increasingly, by rising credit costs  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.37,0)">Moreover, those LCBGs that suffered substantial losses in the second half of 2007 remained among the weakest ones in the first three quarters of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">At the same time, however, the regulatory capital buffers of euro area LCBGs improved moderately as a consequence of additional capital raised and slower growth in risk-weighted assets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">While this was largely due to the actions of individual banks aimed at reducing risks in their balance sheets, it also reflected, to a certain degree, the impact of the implementation of Basel II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">In addition, some of the newly attracted capital came in the form of hybrid financing which is reaching prudential limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.93,0)">Nevertheless, the actions that have been taken by governments and central banks since October 2008 to support the banking systems in euro area countries, despite comfortable solvency ratios, highlight the perceived fragility of the global financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Box 9 of the Review analyses alternative ways in which LCBGs can reduce leverage in the process of restoring their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">It shows that by cutting their dividend pay-out ratios, LCBGs could generate rather substantial additional capital buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.52,0)">On the other hand, if the banks decided to de-leverage mainly by shedding assets, this could imply a sharp contraction of credit to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">It is therefore essential that banks use available opportunities to raise new capital, either from private sources or from the public funds provided by governments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.54,0)">The outlook for euro area insurers also deteriorated, as financial performance has weakened and some pre-existing risks facing the sector increased and some started to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.41,0)">Investment income was reduced by the falling values of structured credit products, corporate bonds and equities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.21,0)">In addition, some insurers suffered losses on investments in commercial property.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">All in all, the information available for the first nine months of 2008 suggests that the shock-absorption capacity of euro area insurers in terms of their solvency positions has not been significantly affected, which should help them to cope with the possible materialisation of the risks they face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.65,0)">The size of euro area insurers’ exposures to structured credit products differ considerable across institutions, as shown in   This is a source of vulnerability in the event that the credit market problems were to affect also the valuations of prime or near-prime asset-backed securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.72,0)">Since insurers can hold investments until maturity  , the key risks from insurers’ credit exposures are not temporary losses in value but defaults.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.73,0)">Nevertheless, sharp downgrades of the ratings of structured credit products could force insurers to reduce their holdings or recognise impairments, which would affect their results and capital positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.51,0)">A summary measure of the risks faced by the euro area banking sector is provided by a market-based systemic risk indicator which is depicted in   However, it is important to emphasise that, since July 2008, participants in the CDS market have started to increasingly discriminate across institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">This could be seen as first sign that the market is on its way to a gradual recovery, because the market no longer “penalises” all banks across the board with similarly high spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">That said, CDS spreads are likely to remain high for some time to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Following a series of defaults or near defaults of several global financial institutions after September 2008, the systemic risk indicator decreased substantially, as central banks took coordinated actions, guarantee schemes were approved and some euro area LCBGs were recapitalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Nevertheless, the indicator has remained above the levels of summer of 2008, which suggests that market participants continued to assign a relatively high probability to systemic defaults by both euro area and global LCBGs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The extraordinary measures that have been taken by central banks and governments since October 2008 are summarised in the table on this slide and are described in detail in the Review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In the euro area, the actions taken and the commitments made have helped to stabilise the banking system and should further mitigate counterparty credit risks from trading in the unsecured interbank money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Over time, and once they have been fully implemented, these measures should improve the functioning of the term money markets and the access of banks to wholesale funding markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">This should lower the cost of bank funding and facilitate the provision of credit to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">That said, in order to revive the process of efficient financial intermediation, financial institutions will need to play their part in the adjustment process by taking advantage of these measures to effectively recapitalise and repair their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Overall assessment Let me conclude with our overall assessment of financial stability at the current juncture: the euro area financial system has undergone a further significant test of its shock-absorbing capacity since the finalisation of the June 2008 Financial Stability Review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.32,0)">At the same time, there are a number of risks and vulnerabilities lying ahead with which the financial system may have to cope, notably the possibility of: a further deterioration in the US and the euro area housing markets and the impact this may have on banks’ loan quality and the value of securities backed by mortgage-related assets; a deeper and more prolonged slowdown in both the global and the euro area economy than currently expected that could cause a sharper and broader deterioration in borrowers’ ability to service their debt; a more pronounced de-leveraging by banks, due to persistently high funding costs and concerns about the adequacy of capital buffers, which could negatively affect the flow of credit extended to the broader economy; and an increase in financial market volatility caused by a further unwinding of positions by hedge funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">All in all, given the risks that lie ahead, banks will need to be especially watchful in ensuring that they have adequate capital and liquidity buffers in place to cushion the challenges ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I am now at your disposal for questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.7,0)">Losses related to banks’ operating activities are not included, to the extent that investments in related assets can be segregated from operating losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.56,0)">If a bank’s core business involves mortgage-loan origination, securitisation, or otherwise requires the firm to hold related assets, these losses are included.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.98,0)">Losses from investments in all other banks or firms are included only if the firms or banks in question are not included in the data used to compute these figures, or if the loss affects cash flows, as in the case of fixed income securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.68,0)">Figures are pre-tax and net of any relevant financial hedges and off-setting gains, unless a bank does not report these factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.38,0)">Most recorded losses are the quarterly or accumulated losses that were reported at quarter-end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.83,0)">One important exception is when the company reports provisions for credit losses and charge-offs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.06,0)">In this case, the year-over-year increase in provisions or charge-offs are used instead, in order to minimise the impact of normal operations on the figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.41,0)">Unless it is certain that loan charge-offs are not included in new provisions for losses, these charge-offs are only recorded for 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.42,0)">The underlying assumption is that charge-offs after the end of 2007 are already included in previously recorded provisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.84,0)">Some banks do not expect to fully realise these write-downs, especially in the case of unrealised losses, mark-to-market losses, and loss provisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.95,0)">Inclusion in the figures is not meant to imply that the firm has already incurred such losses, and any reversals or realised gains are included to mitigate the effects on write-down figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.22,0)">Gains and losses from asset sales   and divestitures   are also included.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The after-tax gain on asset sales is reported so as to provide a more accurate picture of its effect on equity, if this data is provided by the firm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Otherwise, pre-tax gains or total proceeds from sales are used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.58,0)">A capital infusion may also be excluded if sufficient information is not available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.34,0)">Information on write-downs and capital raised is limited by the individual bank’s willingness and ability to report it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.81,0)">In general, data is included from the first quarter in which the bank reported related losses on, and the first observations are for Q2/2007.</span>
