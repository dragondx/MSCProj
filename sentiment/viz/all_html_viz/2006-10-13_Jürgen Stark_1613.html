    <h3> Speaker: Jürgen Stark </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)"> The euro area’s role in the global economy Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board and the Governing Council of the European Central Bank,held at The Institute of European Affairs,Dublin, 13 October 2006 Introduction I appreciate the opportunity to speak before the Institute of European Affairs, and I would like to thank the Institute for providing a forum where issues of global economic governance can be discussed and evaluated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">I am also very glad that this gives me an opportunity to re-visit Ireland which in many respects is a model for many other euro area countries with regard to economic dynamism and structural efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Today, I would like to offer you my reflections on the growing role of the euro area in the world economy that leads to additional responsibility for euro area policy makers: by keeping our own house in order we can make a significant contribution to good global economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In my presentation today I will, first, briefly recall the level of integration we have achieved in Europe followed by the euro area’s position in the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Second, in assessing that position and evaluating its dynamics over time we need to take stock of both the achievements that we have made and the challenges that are still ahead of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Finally, I will briefly discuss whether European integration and in particular the European economic and monetary union  , can be a model for other regions in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The euro area’s position in the world economy I would like to start with a very important point, namely the fact that the EU and, in particular, the euro area has become a stabilising element in the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In having deepened integration and enlarged the EU step by step over the last 50 years: starting with European Community for Coal and Steel, followed by the European Economic Community, the single market and, finally, the single currency, Europe has contributed to political and economic stability both at home and globally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.9,0)">What has been achieved was unthinkable by many observers 15 to 20 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In a global perspective the EU and the euro area are unique.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">No other model of supranational co-operation or agreement has achieved this high level of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">With the single market, the euro, and the creation of supranational institutions, economic and monetary integration is well advanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">With a total population of 314 million people, the euro area is larger than the US  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In the classification of the IMF, the euro area is the 3rd largest economic area in the world in terms of real GDP  , after the US   and developing Asia   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The euro area is also one of the most important partners in global trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">And the international use of the euro is growing: nearly one third of all international debt securities are denominated in euro, and the share of the euro in global foreign exchange reserves is around 25%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">And looking at the dynamics, following a few years of lack of economic dynamism, the euro area is now regaining even more prominence in the global economy, thereby contributing to an urgently needed rebalancing in global economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Real GDP growth in the euro area is projected to be in a range between 2.2% and 2.8% this year, which is a significant improvement compared to the growth rate of 1.5% observed in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">According to Eurostat, the official statistical institute for the EU, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, real GDP grew by 0.9% in the euro area in the second quarter of 2006, following strong growth also in the first quarter   – thus leading to an annualised growth rate of 3½% in the first half of 2006, which is the fastest pace in more than 5 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In particular, domestic demand has contributed strongly   to this favourable development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This confirms the view that euro area economic growth has become more broadly based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.25,0)">Let me also tackle briefly the developments in the euro area labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">All available data point to an ongoing improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.83,0)">For example, the unemployment rate has fallen continuously since mid-2004 from a peak of 8.9% to below 8% more recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.42,0)">The number of unemployed persons has declined by 1.5 million over the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.78,0)">Turning to the outlook for price developments, HICP inflation fell to 1.8% in September 2006, from 2.3% in August.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">This notwithstanding, on the basis of current energy prices and the higher quotations of futures markets, overall inflation rates are likely to increase again towards the end of the year and in early 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">As a consequence, inflation is projected to remain elevated at levels above 2% on average in 2006 and is likely to remain so in 2007, while the outlook for energy prices is uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Finally, as my talk today is part of the keynote series on global economic governance, let me briefly refer to the euro area’s current account of the balance of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.55,0)">In July 2006, the 12-month cumulated current account balance of the euro area recorded a deficit of 0.6% of GDP after a surplus of 0.3% of GDP a year earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Indeed, the euro area current account is broadly in balance, thereby contributing to limiting global current account imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">A lot has been achieved These recent developments mostly signal a favourable conjunctural position in the business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">But recent research  suggests that relative to the OECD average, euro area countries and companies have pursued comprehensive reform strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Let me give you a few examples: The corporate sector in the euro area has gained competitiveness and robustness through restructuring and innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In particular, there are indications that the profitability of non-financial corporations has, on average, developed favourably in recent years, driven also by lower corporate taxes, moderate wage growth and rationalisation of the production process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Economic reforms have been launched in many euro area economies: To "make work pay", the average tax wedge has been reduced in most euro area countries over the past ten years, especially for lower wage scales.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">There are first indications that labour market reforms and more recently wage moderation are delivering returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Between 1996 and 2005, employment growth in the euro area has been 1.4% p.a.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">, leading to the creation of more than 11 million new jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Since 2001, seven euro area countries   introduced reforms to public pension systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Moreover, privatisation was very extensive in many euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Last but not least, since 1999 the success of the monetary union has contributed to economic stability and sustainable output and employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.83,0)">Let me very briefly take stock of the achievements: The new political regime with a single monetary policy for the euro area and decentralised but co-ordinated economic policies has been considered by many as a real challenge with an uncertain outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">However, monetary union has functioned smoothly from the very beginning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">In particular, the policy framework of the monetary union has been stable since the beginning of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The only change since 1999 has been a reform of the European fiscal rule book, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The introduction of the euro has helped to consolidate the gains derived from European economic integration over past decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">In the almost eight years since the launch of EMU the ECB’s monetary policy has kept inflation low and generated trust in the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">As the credibility of the ECB’s monetary policy is high, inflation expectations have developed broadly consistent with price stability as defined by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Overall, important steps have been made in the right direction since the mid-1990s, both in European integration and in structural reform efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">However, this does not mean that we can be complacent about the pace and the achievements of structural reforms and European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.29,0)">There is still a lot of work to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In particular, there is still much scope to exploit the benefits of the single market and EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.53,0)">A lot needs to be done Indeed, a closer look at the euro area in comparison with the US confirms that the euro area is still lagging behind the US in major economic indicators: GDP per capita measured in purchasing power parity is still roughly one quarter lower than in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The employment rate in the euro area is around 64%, compared with 72% in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me also say a few words on recent developments in labour productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.88,0)">In the US productivity was 2.2% p.a.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.2,0)">on average between 1996 and 2005, compared with only 1.3% in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The better performance of the US economy mainly reflects strong improvements in the ICT-using sector and, to a lesser extent, in the ICT-producing sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">However, from the first to the second quarter of this year productivity in the euro area increased by 0.5%, following a similar growth rate in the first quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This translates into 2.0% on an annualised basis, in the first half of 2006   , which is clearly above the long-term average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">While this is rather impressive, one should however take into account the very cyclical nature of productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.09,0)">We should therefore keep in mind that the annualised productivity growth rate is rather volatile and may overstate the extent to which recent developments in productivity are above trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.6,0)">Other challenges the euro area is facing include an ageing and declining population as well as the need to undertake further pension and health care reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This points to still existing significant weaknesses on the supply side of the economy and calls for further structural reforms to increase the potential growth rate of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Even an ageing society is capable to increase potential growth, namely by: raising the employment rate; extending working time, in life -, yearly - and weekly terms; and fostering productivity growth through increasing R&D activities and expenditure supporting innovation; as well as through improving education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Thus, further structural reforms are needed to support competition, economic flexibility, innovation, and labour productivity growth in the euro area as well as the international competitiveness of the euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Structural reforms are a necessary condition for permanently higher employment rates and increasing real incomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">They also help to eliminate price pressures that are due to lack of competition and facilitate the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In this context, European policymakers have renewed their commitment to the Lisbon Agenda, which has identified all major areas for which structural reforms are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">While progress in achieving these ambitious goals has been moderate to date, more recently there has been a shift in focus towards growth and employment objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The Partnership for Growth and Jobs and renewed structural reform commitments are welcome initiatives by national governments and the Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">The main issue now is to live up to these renewed political commitments and to rapidly implement these structural reform measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Five steps to higher potential growth Let me propose a direction for structural reforms: in five steps to higher potential growth: First of all, well-functioning labour and product markets are extremely important in fostering higher economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">It is essential for the euro area to ensure that it has a fully operational internal market, allowing a free flow of labour and capital and free trade in goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This would allow the euro area to realise its substantial potential for stronger output and employment growth and to increase its resilience to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.7,0)">Regarding product markets, empirical studies  have shown that lack of competition limits production efficiency and reduces the incentive to innovate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">While substantial progress has been made, barriers to competition remain, notably in the services and network sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">To get more people into work and to increase working hours on a life-time basis, necessary labour supply side measures include further reforms of tax and benefit systems to increase incentives to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Furthermore, the use of flexible forms of work such as part-time and temporary work may also provide further working incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Finally, labour mobility within EMU and higher wage flexibility are also important building blocks for well-functioning labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">A second prerequisite for higher growth in the euro area is the unlocking of business potential by creating an entrepreneurial-friendly economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">This includes lowering costs imposed by public sector administrations for existing firms and business start-ups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me illustrate this very briefly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.48,0)">According to the World Bank, in 2004, the average cost of starting a business with up to 50 employees in the euro area   is estimated to have been around ten times larger than in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Also, in 2005 it took on average 27 days to start-up a business in the euro area, compared with only 5 days in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I strongly support the Presidency Conclusions of the March 2006 European Council that Member States should establish by 2007 a one-stop-shop for setting up a company in a quick and simple way within one week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Third, to fully exploit productivity potential, policies are needed to support innovation  , technological change and human capital building.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">This includes, inter alia, measures to support innovation by higher investment in research and development  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In 2004, 1.9% of euro area GDP was spent on R&D.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The US spent 2.8% of GDP on R&D.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Well-targeted public funding of university research and a strengthening of the interaction between universities and the private sector are important factors that support R&D.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The role of human capital has become more important as a result of recent technological advancements which make economic activity increasingly knowledge-based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.79,0)">So far investment in human capital in Europe is clearly insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.86,0)">In the euro area, only 21% of the working age population have a tertiary degree, while it is 38% in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Fourth, a well developed financial system boosts economic efficiency by channelling resources to the most profitable activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">A financial system also channels resources across time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Empirical studies have documented a positive link between the degree of development of financial systems and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">A number of measures could increase the efficiency of the financial system in the euro area, especially those that promote financial innovation, increase the completeness of markets, reduce transaction costs and increase competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Fifth, as regards fiscal policy, all countries should take advantage of the current economic recovery to consolidate fiscal balances and thereby help to improve long-term financing conditions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">It is also crucial that comprehensive reform programmes strengthen economic incentives and enhance the sustainability of social security systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In several euro area Member States public finances appear to be on track to meet or even exceed this year’s targets as the favourable economic situation, revenue windfalls and effective consolidation measures exert a positive influence on fiscal balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.57,0)">However, in other countries, the current fiscal outlook suggests a shortfall in terms of the required structural improvement in public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.78,0)">This is worrying in view of the objectives and commitments agreed under the revised Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Sound fiscal policies can make an important contribution to sustainable non-inflationary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">They lower risk premia on long-term interest rates and thus generate positive wealth effects, which in turn stimulate investment and private consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Fiscal consolidation is also indicated in order to cope with the acute demographic challenges imposed by an ageing of the European population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">These five steps describe the “homework” to be done to foster growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The proposed measures are also appropriate in addressing global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">They are consistent with the bottom line of the internationally agreed strategy to the adjustment of global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Accordingly, the orderly unwinding of global imbalances requires policy efforts agreed at the international level and to be implemented at the domestic level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The G7 agenda calls for policies that are suitable to address these imbalances, but more generally foster economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In the United States, further action including continued fiscal consolidation is needed to boost national saving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">For emerging Asian with large current account surpluses, greater exchange rate flexibility is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">In the case of Japan and Europe, structural reforms have been identified as the appropriate contribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">EMU a model for other regions in the world?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">While EMU is a success story with respect to the single monetary policy a lot needs to be done in the areas of fiscal policies and structural reforms to fully exploit the benefits of the single market and the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Against the background of what I said above, is EMU a model for other regions in the world?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">In fact, the advent of the euro has rekindled the interest of outside policy makers and academics in the European experience with regional economic integration, this time with particular regard to the monetary sphere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">While this should not lead us to any attitude of complacency, Europe’s monetary success is often seen by others as an exemplary achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">By showing that creating a well functioning monetary union between sovereign Member States is – under given conditions – possible, the launch of EMU in 1999 has given new impetus to the idea of setting up regional arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">To the eyes of their supporters, striving for regional monetary integration is equal to pursuing a higher degree of nominal convergence, issuing a hard currency, strengthening regional institutions, particularly the status of central banks and establishing regional surveillance mechanisms to reign in lax and irresponsible budgetary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The final goal is increasing wealth by enhancing growth and job creation by way of increasing cross-regional trade in a stable macroeconomic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">It goes without saying that reaching such a remarkably positive outcome requires a strong political commitment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The process of integration is a long-lasting one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.93,0)">It cannot be achieved over night.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The political and economic conditions after World War II in Europe as well as “visionary” politicians enabled Europe to deepen co-operation and integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It took nearly 40 years to create a single European market and it took even longer to establish a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">We still have to work hard to exploit the potential of both, the single market and the euro, to the benefit of euro area citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">But each region has to find and to define its own way to integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Let me conclude my remarks by confirming that, while Europe is seen – rightly so – in other regions as a successful example for regional monetary integration, progress towards the same goal has varied around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">This confirms, to my eyes, that achieving a successful monetary union requires a combination of prerequisites.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">First and foremost, it is necessary to combine a steady political willingness with the pursuit of sustainable and coherent economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">India and China.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Duval and Elmeskov  , OECD Working Paper No.</span><span
