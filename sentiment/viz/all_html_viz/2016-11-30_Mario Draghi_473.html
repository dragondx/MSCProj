    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)"> The productivity challenge for Europe Lectio magistralis by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, marking the 100th anniversary of the Deusto Business School, Madrid, 30 November 2016 The euro area economy continues to expand at a moderate, but steady, pace and labour markets are gradually improving, including notably here in Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This gradual upward trend is expected to continue, not least owing to our monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.18,0)">But productivity growth has remained very subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">In 1995, productivity growth in the euro area was on a par with the rest of the world at about 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.16,0)">But now, at below 0.5%, it lags behind the growth rates of the United States, other advanced economies and emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.48,0)">If it persists, this slowdown in productivity growth will matter greatly for our future prosperity, and will have direct consequences for the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy and the cohesion of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.96,0)">Consider first the challenge caused by ageing populations, which many economies will face in the coming decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.55,0)">The share of working-age persons in the total population is projected to decline across Europe, and this is particularly marked in some economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.38,0)">In the absence of change – if output per worker, structural unemployment, and labour participation remain at current levels – population ageing will result in a stark fall of output per capita.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.17,0)">Using the OECD’s population projections, the decline in output per head by 2050 would be 14% in Germany, 16% in Italy and 22% in Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.97,0)">While this scenario is very unlikely to materialise, it shows that current rates of productivity growth are barely sufficient to offset the demographic drag on per capita income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Structural reforms are therefore urgently needed to raise productivity growth and unlock unused labour potential and thereby avoid stagnation in per capita income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">But the benefits of structural reforms to the welfare of people in the euro area extend beyond increasing aggregate incomes and offsetting the demographic drag.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">They also empower other policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Stronger potential output growth aids monetary policy by increasing the equilibrium real interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Higher equilibrium rates provide more room for monetary policy to operate without being constrained by the effective lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">This in turn reduces the likelihood that unconventional measures will be required to counteract future downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">And higher future growth helps monetary policy today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">It encourages households to spend more and firms to invest, reducing the need for monetary policy to support current economic activity and bring inflation back towards 2%, and speeding up the return to more conventional monetary policy settings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">There are benefits for fiscal policy too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">By lifting output and employment and lowering unemployment, reforms improve governments’ structural balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.64,0)">Moreover, higher levels of potential output reduce the current overhang of public sector debt that is impinging on some countries’ ability to carry out stabilisation policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The greater fiscal space also enables governments to redistribute the benefits of reforms across the whole population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.54,0)">Some reforms can have upfront negative distributional effects, which governments may want to offset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Structural reforms also help fully unlock the benefits of the Single Market and thereby improve the cohesiveness of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Increased convergence not only reinforces the integrity of the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">It also builds up the trust among Member States that is necessary to take further integration steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">And finally, structural reforms make the euro area economy more resilient in the face of the disruptive influence of globalisation and digitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">All these reasons highlight the vital importance of structural reforms for the welfare and well-functioning of our union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Let me now briefly consider the factors behind the euro area’s recent lacklustre productivity performance, before setting out some necessary steps for improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.71,0)">Factors contributing to low productivity growth in the euro area There are two underlying sources of labour productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The first is the amount of capital available to each worker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Raising investment is therefore a key part of tackling the productivity challenge in many advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The second relates to how efficiently resources are used, and includes such things as innovation and organisational improvements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This is total factor productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.85,0)">It is in this area that the euro area performance has been particularly weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">There are many reasons put forward for this weakness, but in essence they relate to the role of innovation, technology adoption and efficient reallocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.48,0)">Some argue that innovations now are on a smaller scale than in previous decades and centuries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The argument goes that the 19th century witnessed the diffusion of transformative inventions such as the railway and electricity; whereas nowadays our innovations are things such as an app to order a taxi, rather than phoning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">To an extent this may be true, but the facts seem to say otherwise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.92,0)">If falling total factor productivity growth were caused by slowing progress at the technological frontier, you would expect productivity growth of firms at that frontier to be correspondingly poor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The opposite appears true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">From 2003 to 2013, productivity at global frontier manufacturing firms – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">the top 100 firms globally in each sector in terms of productivity – increased by a quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Productivity growth at global frontier service sector firms was even higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">And, importantly, the performance of euro area firms at the frontier is on a par with that of other advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.48,0)">It is productivity growth among the non-frontier firms that is poor across the OECD countries, explaining the slowdown in aggregate productivity growth across advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Productivity in non-frontier manufacturing firms increased by just 10%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.88,0)">And, for the euro area, the picture for non-frontier firms appears even worse, with non-frontier productivity stagnating in manufacturing and even declining in services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.91,0)">Overall, the picture appears to be not so much a lack of technological progress per se, but a lack of diffusion of progress from the frontier to other firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">In other words, the laggard firms aren’t absorbing the new technology and incorporating it into their production processes to increase their efficiency, possibly due a lack of competitive pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">But labour productivity growth not only depends on the efficiency gains of each firm in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It also depends on the extent to which capital and labour are allocated to the most productive firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.65,0)">Here, again, there are signs of underperformance in the euro area, particularly in the non-tradable sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.75,0)">Recent research suggests that this misallocation of capital and labour is trending upwards in many euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.52,0)">In conclusion, therefore, the euro area’s poor productivity appears a result of poor diffusion of technology from the frontier to other firms, and from an inefficient allocation of capital and labour to relatively low productivity firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Such factors are fortunately more receptive to structural reforms than innovation, which is harder to institute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">There are two main areas that need to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">First, barriers to knowledge diffusion need to be brought down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">This includes fostering a competitive business environment that encourages the adoption of the best management techniques and organisational structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Here, there is a clear role for institutions such as the one whose centenary we are celebrating today to aid this diffusion of knowledge and best practice across firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Second, productive firms need to be able to grow, to attract both capital and skilled workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">This requires well-functioning capital, product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">It is crucial that the Single Market is completed, particularly in the services sector where misallocation is largest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.18,0)">Regulatory barriers that inhibit small firms from gaining headcount need to be relaxed – there is evidence that productive firms choose not to grow rather than cross the threshold and incur greater administrative expenses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Recent reforms in Italy and Spain have sought to address this problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Improving allocation also requires a well-functioning financial system that can direct funds to dynamic firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Adequate institutional and judicial frameworks, such as bankruptcy laws and the ability of banks to enforce collateral arrangements, are also needed to ensure capital is not trapped in unproductive or failed firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The steps taken here in Spain to reduce the legacy effects of the banking crisis will help invigorate the flow of new credit towards profitable and growing firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Bolstering the contribution from labour supply The solution to the demographic challenge lies not just in making current workers more productive, but also increasing the working share of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.12,0)">Structural unemployment is high in the euro area, and has increased steadily for decades with each successive economic cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.47,0)">Labour force participation rates across much of the euro area similarly lag those of the top performers in the OECD by a large margin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Reducing the structural unemployment rate and increasing participation rates to the average levels of the top three economies in the euro area is in many cases sufficient to offset the demographic drag, even assuming output per worker remains the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.39,0)">In the short run, bringing additional workers into the workforce may lower average productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">But lowering structural unemployment helps protect future labour productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.3,0)">Workers who remain unemployed for long periods suffer permanent losses throughout their life, in terms of lower income, productivity and employability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.05,0)">This is particularly the case for young unemployed people, who risk losing important experience in their formative years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.03,0)">The current high rates of youth unemployment are likely compromising the future productivity of this generation – and it’s precisely this group which will have to support a larger number of dependants than previous generations did.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">The labour market reforms in Spain in mid-2012 are an example of a structural reform that has been successful in unblocking the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.56,0)">The unemployment rate peaked at 26.5% in 2013 but is now at 19%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">While still very high, the decline of nearly 8 percentage points in three years against a backdrop of major deleveraging is remarkable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The European Commission estimates the reforms had a cumulative impact of 0.5% on GDP and of 0.8% on employment between 2013 and 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The OECD estimates that the reforms contributed to moderated unit labour cost growth, increased hiring by 8% and reduced job separation by 24%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Analysis by the IMF reached similar conclusions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Other examples of successful labour market reforms in the euro area have similarly resulted in an employment-intensive recovery in the reforming countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Labour markets need to improve to deliver a skilled, flexible workforce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Reducing skill mismatches lowers structural unemployment and enables productive firms to grow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It also importantly addresses one of the main factors explaining the increase in income inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The key here is education, which includes life-long learning and retraining, potentially bolstered by schemes to facilitate re-allocation of workers across sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Breaking down the barriers that create duality in the labour market will enable the unemployed youth of today to become the high-skilled older workers of the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The slowing momentum of reform So, structural reforms to boost productivity and participation and reduce structural unemployment are vital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">And that is why the Governing Council continues to call for such reforms in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.47,0)">Yet reform momentum appears to be slowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.05,0)">Why then, given the clear benefits and urgent need for reforms, are governments reluctant to carry them out?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.34,0)">One factor is the distributional impact of reforms, particularly in the near term, which can make them unpopular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.75,0)">But what is often overlooked in the public debate about structural reforms is the distributional impact of inaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.7,0)">The high rates of structural unemployment, duality in the labour market and people being discouraged from entering the labour market have also a human as well as an economic cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Reducing unemployment is socially positive from a distributional point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">But it is clearly important to design the reforms so that they are as inclusive as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">By counteracting any negative distributional effects of reforms, governments can build broad-based support for further welfare-enhancing reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.47,0)">Of course, not all redistribution resulting from reforms is socially negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Removing inefficiently high economic rents in protected sectors, notably non-tradable ones, can have marked positive benefits on social welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.03,0)">Entrenched special interests can have powerful lobbying operations, though, that governments need to resist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.08,0)">As these barriers to implementing structural reforms are perennial, what then has driven the implementation of reforms in the past?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">The literature on the subject is relatively new, but highlights a number of drivers, in particular economic crises and high unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">For the EU, the Single Market directives are an important driver of product market reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Correct sequencing of reforms can also help – product market reforms can facilitate the subsequent implementation of labour market reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">By eliminating barriers to entry, pro-competition product market reforms can eliminate inefficiencies, in turn promoting higher economic activity and employment, and thereby offsetting possible short-term costs of later labour market reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.13,0)">But what about monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.25,0)">As it turns out, the literature says little about how monetary policy drives the reform process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">One view is that an accommodative monetary policy stance may increase the room for manoeuvre of governments, allowing measures to offset some of the short-term costs of reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.37,0)">But there are certainly some commentators who at present believe that the ECB’s unconventional measures are stifling incentives for reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">To answer this question, preliminary internal research at the ECB investigates the drivers of structural reform in 40 OECD countries over the past three decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">This research supports previous findings in the literature on the drivers of reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.74,0)">On monetary policy, it finds that lower interest rates, if at all, tend to support rather than hinder the implementation of reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">We also see this confirmed by anecdotal evidence in some larger euro area countries, which recently implemented some important labour market reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It seems, then, that we should put more weight on the former view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">By acting in accordance with our mandate, namely to support activity to bring inflation back in line with our medium-term objective, the ECB is in fact also providing space for euro area governments to carry out the necessary structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is a window of opportunity they should seize.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.01,0)">The euro area faces a significant demographic challenge in the coming decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Reversing the decline in productivity growth and improving labour market outcomes are both required to meet this challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.6,0)">Without concerted effort on structural reforms, per capita income growth in the euro area is likely to stagnate, and may even decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">The welfare benefits of structural reforms extend beyond just protecting income per capita.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The distributional impacts of lower unemployment and higher participation are positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Increasing potential output growth provides both monetary and fiscal policy more space to operate in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">By breaking down barriers, reforms allow the full benefits of the Single Market to be realised, increasing economic cohesion and strengthening the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The ECB’s current monetary policy settings are designed to support activity to bring inflation back to our objective of close to, but below, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">In doing so, we are lowering the risk that the current low rates of growth become entrenched, but we alone cannot eliminate that risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Monetary policy is providing support and space for governments to carry out necessary structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is up to euro area governments to act, individually at national level as well as jointly at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Draghi, M.  , “Structural reforms, inflation and monetary policy”, speech at the ECB Forum on Central Banking,
