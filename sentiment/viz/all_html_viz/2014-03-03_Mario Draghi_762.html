    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.93,0)"> Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Brussels, 3 March 2014 Madame Chair, Honourable Members, This is my last hearing in ECON before the end of this legislature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">I would like to first of all thank you, Sharon, for the way you have guided this committee throughout a challenging period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Let me also thank all of you for the frank and fruitful exchanges we have had in the last two-and-a-half years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">It has been an invaluable experience for me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">In these difficult crisis times, discharging accountability in front of an assembly with a true European perspective has been helpful for the public acceptance of our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Moreover, the hearings have always been a welcome occasion to discuss the state of Economic and Monetary Union between two genuinely European institutions and to debate about what is the right way forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">I am very much looking forward to continuing this approach with the new ECON committee from July onwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">I would like to take the opportunity of this last hearing to take stock of the monetary policy that the ECB has conducted over the last five years and to review what has been achieved in the euro area over the course of these years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me then also offer our assessment of the challenges that lie ahead and that will await the new Parliament and the new Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.74,0)">Before I start to go into detail in these three areas, let me however remind you that the next meeting of the ECB Governing Council takes place on Thursday.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.09,0)">In view of the so-called purdah period, you will understand that I will not be able to give detailed answers on our monetary policy stance today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Five years of monetary policy – the ECB has delivered In the last five years, the ECB has continued to take the necessary measures with a view to maintaining price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.87,0)">Let me turn back to the first hearing of this Parliament’s term which took place with my predecessor in September 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.16,0)">At the time, the economy was just bottoming out in the aftermath of the great contraction which had ensued after Lehman’s failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.3,0)">We were witnessing negative inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In this environment, the outlook was seen to be broadly in line with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Inflation was projected to increase toward levels close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.2,0)">The key ECB interest rates were kept on hold at the very low level to which they had been brought in several stages since the autumn of the preceding year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Some phasing-out of non-standard measures was announced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.91,0)">However, in May 2010, sovereign debt markets froze in various euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.02,0)">Financial fragmentation took a new and unfamiliar form, with financial conditions and the transmission of our monetary policy varying to a great extent across Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">We responded by introducing the Securities Markets Programme, focused on purchases of government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.58,0)">Initially, while the economic impact of the sovereign debt crisis was limited and largely confined to vulnerable economies, the rapid global recovery put upside pressure on energy prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.28,0)">This drove up inflation also in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">We decided to raise interest rates in early 2011 given upside risks to the medium term inflation outlook stemming from energy prices and from ample monetary liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.55,0)">However, the sovereign debt crisis deepened and the euro area entered a second recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The inflationary pressures that had emerged before receded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Therefore, we lowered interest rates in a series of steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.25,0)">Stress in sovereign debt markets quickly undermined the wholesale funding conditions of banks based in those Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">To forestall a credit crunch, we introduced refinancing operations with maturities of up to three years, in a context of full liquidity allotment at a fixed rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.82,0)">As the mutual exposures of banks and their sovereigns fed an adverse, self-reinforcing confidence crisis, investors started to fear that public and private liabilities issued in certain Member States would not be redeemed in our common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">A significant redenomination risk arose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">As you know, the integrity of the euro area is an absolute precondition for us to be able to deliver on the mandate prescribed by the Treaty and in particular to ensure a smooth transmission of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In order to preserve this integrity, we thus announced our readiness to conduct Outright Monetary Transactions with the specific purpose of removing compensation for that risk from the financial pricing of securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This announcement reversed the destabilising capital flows that redenomination fears had encouraged in spring 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.81,0)">While financial markets had been on a steady course toward normalisation for some months, in late spring and summer of 2013 the euro area money market – not unlike elsewhere in the global financial system – became subject to external shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">We noted a sustained increase in expected interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.8,0)">This was unwarranted in view of our underlying macroeconomic conditions, and was not in line with the Governing Council’s policy intentions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In July last year we therefore clarified the orientation of monetary policy going forward: we offered forward guidance on the future path of policy conditional on the evolving outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">All our measures, standard and non-standard, have been taken to serve our primary objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.77,0)">And they have delivered: since June 2009   the average inflation rate in the euro area has been 1.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">In exceptional circumstances, our measures were exceptional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">But our commitment to our primary objective has not changed, and our strategy has remained the guide of our action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Our credible commitment to these core elements is reflected in medium to longer-term inflation expectations remaining firmly anchored in line with the Governing Council’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Five years of economic and governance reforms – the euro area is more stable and resilient The last five years have not only seen effective monetary policy-making in the euro area – we should also remind ourselves that much has been achieved in the field of economic policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Four years after the first Member States requested financial assistance, today we can safely say that the worst has been averted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The political will of all actors involved has been strong enough to defend the integrity of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.41,0)">Many had underestimated this will.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">And more than that: Contrary to the bleak picture that some are trying to paint these days, the euro area is – in terms of economic fundamentals and institutional set-up – on a better footing than it was at the beginning of this Parliament’s mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">It is clearly moving in the right direction – the glass is at least half-full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.0,0)">To a large extent, this can be attributed to the correction of economic policies at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Imbalances are receding and foundations are being laid for improved competitiveness and stronger growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This is especially true for programme countries, which have undertaken a remarkable effort to consolidate public balance sheets, repair their financial sectors and reform the structure of their economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Beyond national policies, the euro area as a whole has become more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">In these turbulent years, when the return to national remedies often looked tempting, the European Parliament with its true European perspective played a crucial role in ensuring truly European solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.71,0)">I am aware that the institutional approach that had to be taken at some instances has created some discomfort especially within your house.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">But overall, let us recognise what has been achieved: First, the six-pack, the two-pack and the Fiscal Compact have made the governance framework more commensurate to the challenges of a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This was an important step towards sound public finances in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Second, improved financial regulation   and the gradual steps towards a true banking union   will importantly reduce the risk that a crisis of the magnitude that we have just experienced will materialise again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.79,0)">Third, in 2010, there had been no arrangements in place to deal with Member States losing market access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.51,0)">This absence had created major uncertainty in markets about the way forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">With the ESM and the two-pack, both a permanent funding instrument and a governance framework have been created.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This has been a major step forward and will ensure that in the future, the euro area will be better prepared to respond to such crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.47,0)">In historic perspective, five years are a blink of an eye.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In less than five years, the euro area has taken a remarkable leap forward that has kept us together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.79,0)">This cannot be highlighted enough in the weeks to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The next five years ahead – towards completing the Union I have no doubt that from July on the next parliament will continue to assume the important role this house has played in the last legislature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.07,0)">The challenges that still lie ahead of us are too important and too complex to indulge in complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It is too early to claim “mission accomplished”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.49,0)">People in the euro area are still suffering from the inevitable adjustment process following years of accumulated imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.01,0)">Unemployment remains unacceptably high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Citizens are judging Europe on its capacity to deliver jobs and sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The years to come are about creating a more perfect union that caters to these objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Foremost, this means delivering on commitments made in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Member States need to keep their promises to correct imbalances and to reform the structure of their economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Fiscal policies have to be brought in line with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact and of the Fiscal Compact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Fiscal consolidation should be designed in a growth friendly manner while structural reforms will boost potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.55,0)">This concerns all Member States, not just those who looked at some point into the abyss of losing market access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.7,0)">This concerns also the European institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">They have to ensure that common rules are thoroughly and evenly applied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Delivering on past commitments also means keeping the promise made by Heads of States or Governments in June 2012 to complete banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">It means swift transposition of agreed directives into national law and a stringent application of the adopted regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">It also means that a strong second pillar of banking union, a Single Resolution Mechanism, needs to be agreed before the end of this legislature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Creating a more perfect union also requires filling the remaining gaps in the architecture of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">A genuine and comprehensive Economic and Monetary Union as outlined in the Four Presidents Report should still remain our long-term objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">This does not mean pushing integration as far as we can.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.57,0)">This is neither economically necessary nor politically realistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">It means aligning economic governance and policies of Member States where appropriate to ensure that positive spillovers are enforced while negative externalities are minimised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Sharing sovereignty in crucial policy areas is certainly one way to accomplish this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.52,0)">It is not for a central bank to prescribe solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.23,0)">This is a political prerogative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">But it is my hope both as a central banker and as a European citizen that the upcoming electoral campaign will serve as an opportunity to engage in a debate on solutions for Europe’s common way forward.</span>
