    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.26,0)"> Speech Cross-border banking since the crisis – lessons for supervisors Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 10 Years Vienna Initiative - Anniversary Conference 2019, in Vienna, Austria, 27 March 2019 The crisis has shown that the banking sector is deeply interconnected worldwide, and that a banking crisis can quickly spread from one country to another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.58,0)">It also laid bare a number of weaknesses in the global regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">But after long and tough negotiations, we agreed on the Basel III framework, which addresses most of the weaknesses found in global regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">It will help make global financial markets safer by ensuring that global banks and banks with cross-border activities have to comply with a common framework of minimum capital, liquidity and risk management standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.4,0)">The crisis clearly showed that supervision should not stop at national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">And it also showed us that cooperation between home and host supervisors is key to understanding the risks banks are exposed to when doing business across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In recent years, cooperation between supervisors has increased significantly, on the back of new global and European standards for home/host cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Cooperation between supervisors has become natural; in fact, it has become essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This cooperation has been institutionalised via supervisory colleges and crisis management groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Standards now apply when information is exchanged between host and home supervisors, and when joint fact findings and assessments are due.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And various criteria now apply when supervisors from different countries have to agree on joint action regarding banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Of course, it is easier to cooperate in theory than in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And it is easier to cooperate in normal times than in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">The Vienna Initiative was an important example of cooperation in crisis times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">And with the Vienna Initiative 2.0 in particular, we have seen how important it is to provide structures and platforms for home/host cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.96,0)">It is undeniable that, in times of crisis, the interests of home and host supervisors may diverge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.01,0)">But without cooperation, it would be very difficult to maintain financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Breaking this kind of prisoner’s dilemma requires trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But trust cannot be built over a few days of talks at the height of a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Trust requires us to understand each other’s priorities and constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And this takes time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In a way, this should be seen as an investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">As a supervisor, you should invest your time in building trust with other authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">It will pay off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In practice, the fact that this lesson has not been fully learned, means there are still obstacles to cross-border banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In Europe, we have gone one step further in ensuring that banks in the euro area are supervised according to one approach – an essential part of the response to the crisis was to create a single supervisor for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The single rulebook forms the basis for this supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.91,0)">But this rulebook is not as single as supervisors would like.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">There are still some important areas in urgent need of harmonisation, not only to ensure a level playing field, but also to promote cross-border banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.98,0)">I will mention just a few: Fit and proper rules are not harmonised at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.87,0)">Many crisis-related supervisory competences are not harmonised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">There are still some options and national discretions open to Member States, which means banks can be treated differently for reasons other than the underlying risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">We see that cross-border banking has recovered elsewhere but not in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.71,0)">European banks still lag behind in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.97,0)">In part, this is also due to ring fencing, which limits banks’ ability to freely move liquidity and capital within groups in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">I understand that taking the first step in eliminating ring-fencing is daunting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.8,0)">Host country supervisors fear being left to foot the bill of costly crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.5,0)">For small economies, or large economies with a large number of foreign banks, this is a challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">But it is a challenge we need to find a common solution to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">And we need to find this solution before the next crisis hits.</span>
