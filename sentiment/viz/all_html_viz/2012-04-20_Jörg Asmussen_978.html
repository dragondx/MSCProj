    <span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)"> Key issues about the crisis and the European response Intervention by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the Center for Strategic and International StudiesWashington, 20 April 2012 It is a pleasure to be here today at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and I would like to thank Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg for his kind invitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In recent years a common theme in U.S. foreign policy discussions was whether to disengage from Europe and focus on the Pacific.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Today it seems that people in Washington are more interested than ever in European affairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.97,0)">Unfortunately, it is for entirely the wrong reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">How nice it would be to go back to those days of being irrelevant!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">I would like to set the stage for our discussion today by addressing some of the key issues about the crisis and the European response to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">These issues get to the heart of the major debates in the U.S. and Europe at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.73,0)">They are complex and they require us to think long-term and avoid simplifications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Ultimately, they are about what kind of Europe we want for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.53,0)">In particular, I will focus my intervention on three questions: Is the worst of the crisis over?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Is the European response to the crisis killing growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.23,0)">Is the ECB’s response to the crisis swamping the world with liquidity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.61,0)">Is the worst of the crisis over?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.92,0)">Policy-makers are often asked if the worst of the crisis is over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.34,0)">It is a difficult question to answer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.17,0)">If we are optimistic we are accused of cheerleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.9,0)">If we are pessimistic we risk panicking the markets and setting off self-fulfilling cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.29,0)">So we have to go by what the data are telling us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">And the data show a clear stabilisation in the global economy since last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The U.S. is showing signs of a sustained recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.25,0)">Data releases have consistently surprised on the upside throughout the first quarter of this year, although April was more mixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Survey data point to a moderate expansion in economic activity in early 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.37,0)">Unemployment is now at the lowest level since January 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.21,0)">In the euro area, survey data confirm a stabilisation in economic activity at a low level in early 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We continue to expect the euro area economy to recover gradually in the course of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The outlook is supported by strong export growth to the U.S. and emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.54,0)">Downside risks remain, however, related to a possible worsening of the sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Financial markets are also now generally less volatile – although we must closely monitor the situation in the Spanish government bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.59,0)">Certainly the doomsday predictions from the fourth quarter of last year seem to have been avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.22,0)">We should not forget that, only five months ago, der Spiegel, the leading German weekly magazine ran an article entitled “A continent stares into the abyss”, which declared that the end-game for the euro had begun.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.4,0)">The front cover of The Economist magazine in the same week asked “Is this really the end?”, set against an image of a burning 1 euro coin hurtling towards oblivion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.44,0)">What changed in this time?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.58,0)">In my view, the explanation is actions taken at three levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">First, Member States recognised the seriousness of the situation and implemented major reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Spain has begun addressing its competitiveness problem with the most significant labour market reform in a generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It is also improving central control over regional spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Italy is increasing competition and modernising its public administration to increase its potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The debt exchange in Greece was successful, which gives the country a fresh start to address its fiscal and competitiveness issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Ireland and Portugal have continued to implement their EU-IMF programmes, which are both on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Second, Europe has strengthened its economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Fiscal rules have been reinforced through the agreement on the fiscal compact, which obliges all euro area countries to run a structural balanced budget.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It also shifts the onus for enforcement away from Brussels and onto national institutions, encouraging greater ownership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Monitoring of economic policies will go deeper through the new “enhanced surveillance” legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It allows the Commission to send missions to countries experiencing or threatened with financial difficulties and recommend policy changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This gives the Commission the power to demand some reforms that the U.S. federal government could not demand of a U.S. state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Euro area firewalls have been strengthened by the decision to increase the total resources to around I trillion US dollars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Altogether, this presents a convincing package for markets: a tough new set of rules, a strong regime for monitoring those rules, and a credible safety net to back it up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Third, the ECB has played its part by preventing a funding crisis in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The two 3-year LTROs launched in December and February have eased bank funding pressures and stopped further deleveraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This should over time support lending to firms and households across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">These actions have pulled the euro area back from the very dangerous situation we faced last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.67,0)">But the crisis of public and private debt in some countries is clearly not over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">The recent rise in Spanish yields is evidence of this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is no longer a problem that can be addressed through bigger firewalls or a more active ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">It can only be addressed through consistent and determined reform, even if it is painful in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.78,0)">In the Spanish case the shift in market sentiment is a result of poor communication on deficit targets and delays in announcing the budget.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.21,0)">In other words, Spain currently has a credibility problem with the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">But this can be fixed by taking measures to regain credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Overall, we should not wait for a ‘silver bullet’ to end the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.93,0)">It does not exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">The end of the crisis will come only after a series of comprehensive steps taken over a number of years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This means all Member States and EU institutions playing their part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Let me stress that we are greatly helped in this task by excellent transatlantic cooperation, not least between the ECB and the Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Among other things, the provision of dollar swaps lines has been a key weapon in fighting the crisis since 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">So the U.S. is also playing an important role in supporting the European recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Is the European response to the crisis killing growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">This leads into my second question: is the response I just described – fiscal consolidation and structural reforms – killing growth in Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is important to understand that we see things differently in Europe and the U.S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">In our view, strong public finances are a pre-condition for sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We see fiscal consolidation as supporting growth, because it creates confidence effects that will support consumption and investment in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.64,0)">Certainly, the short term effects of consolidation can be negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">We recognise this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">That is why we always recommend that consolidation is accompanied by productivity-enhancing structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">This means inter alia opening up closed professions, increasing the efficiency of public administration and improving judicial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">These are reforms that will ultimately benefit the majority of people, by increasing the growth-potential of these economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Take the example of Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">The labour market reforms I mentioned are essential to increase employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.6,0)">The Spanish labour market has for too long been organised in a way that protects insiders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.02,0)">This is what lies behind the very high rate of youth unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">It may be the case that these reforms will not return some of the current problem countries to pre-crisis growth rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">So there will inevitably be calls for more stimulus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.19,0)">But we should keep in mind that the last ten years were not representative: it was a boom period, built on credit, creating ever larger imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.27,0)">That party is now over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">We need to learn the lessons from it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.55,0)">And the lesson from the bursting of a debt bubble cannot be to load up on more debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">These countries need reforms that undo previous excesses and re-build their economies on a more sustainable basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is the direction in which Europe is currently heading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.67,0)">And there is really no alternative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.54,0)">There is one area, however, where I fear we are not learning the right lessons in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.37,0)">Several European countries face a vicious circle where weak domestic banks cause fiscal difficulties for governments, which in turn undermines public debt sustainability and further damages banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.12,0)">In the U.S., such a feedback loop does not exist, because federal institutions act as shock absorbers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">They prevent local crises from becoming systemic: for example, banks can be recapitalised through the U.S. Treasury and resolved through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">In Europe we need to look to the U.S. for inspiration in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This is why I have called for a European bank resolution authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.23,0)">Is the ECB’s response to the crisis swamping the world with liquidity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.69,0)">Let me turn now in more detail to the recent actions by the ECB – in particular, the question whether the 3-year Long Term Refinancing Operations   have swamped the world with liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.93,0)">Behind this question is the implication that increasing central bank liquidity always leads to distortions, be it inflation or currency volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.84,0)">But this misunderstands what central bank liquidity is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">ECB liquidity is a very specific form of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It can be used only to make payments between banks with accounts at the ECB and to meet reserve requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There is no automatic mechanism which converts this liquidity into loans or asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Banks take such decisions based on factors like their financial strength, their risk aversion and the demand for credit by non-financial corporations and private households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.31,0)">So we should not make simplistic assertions about one factor leading to another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.0,0)">We should ask: what are we seeing in the data?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Looking at credit growth in the euro area, we see few signs of distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The LTROs have certainly prevented an abrupt deleveraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">But loans to the euro area private sector increased by only 1.1% in February, compared with an average of around 7% since the start of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Looking at capital flows to other parts of the world, we see a broadly balanced picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The euro has in fact appreciated in effective terms since we conducted the first LTRO in December 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">There have been significant capital inflows due to renewed interest and confidence by foreign investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The strongest effect of the LTROs has been on bank funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Euro area banks issued EUR 55 billion in senior unsecured bank debt in the first two months of this year, more than the whole amount in the second half of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is exactly what the LTROs were intended to achieve: to prevent a bank funding crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Over time we expect this to feed into higher credit for firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">When this happens, we will be constantly alert to any threats of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Our commitment to price stability is steadfast and credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">And observers recognise this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Following the two 3 year LTROs market indicators of inflation expectations – that is, investors risking their own money – show no signs of inflation above our medium-term objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">So to conclude, the euro area still has a lot of work to do to put itself back on a sustainable footing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.14,0)">This work is difficult because it goes to the root of our economic problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">But it is also essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.69,0)">Solutions that would paper over these problems by creating more debt are not in Europe’s long-term interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">They would solve this crisis by creating the conditions for the next one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">But we also need to be patient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The euro area is made up of 17 different democracies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.55,0)">And as you know very well in Washington, democracy is sometimes messy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.76,0)">Events may not play out as an economist would determine in his or her model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.6,0)">We may not take the most direct route to our destination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">But important thing is that, in the end, we get there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">I am confident that in Europe we are heading slowly but surely down the right track.</span>
