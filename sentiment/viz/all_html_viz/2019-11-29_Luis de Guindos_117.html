    <span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)"> Closing remarks Closing remarks by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the VIII High-level Policy Dialogue between Eurosystem and Latin American central banks Cartagena, 29 November 2019 After two days of fruitful discussions, I would like to thank you for a lively and honest exchange of views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">I am grateful for your openness in sharing experiences and for the positive discussions on topics that are highly relevant for policymakers everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Let me briefly summarise the key topics we addressed and give you my main takeaways from this meeting: We looked at fostering growth and trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.77,0)">Protracted weakness and the persistence of prominent downside risks are not only common factors in many of our economies, but are also global phenomena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.17,0)">The weakness in global trade growth – which has decelerated sharply in recent quarters  – is particularly pronounced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.22,0)">Trade tensions and increased protectionism are key drivers of the observed weakness in trade and can also explain part of the subdued momentum in global activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">While some countries might have benefited from positive trade diversion effects, such benefits may have been more than offset by elevated trade policy uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.18,0)">Current subdued GDP growth rates are, however, also homemade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.2,0)">Not sufficiently addressed fiscal and structural weaknesses and low levels of investment typically explain subdued growth figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.35,0)">In addition, political events – and sometimes tensions – aggravate the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Still, the specific country experiences with policy mixes targeted towards increasing potential growth, productivity and investment, while also addressing inequality, are among the most interesting takeaways for me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">And the important role of institutions in the reform process has once again come to the fore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">On the positive side, there are pockets of opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">There are, for example, efforts in both the euro area and Latin America to open up further and to facilitate trade, though the situation differs significantly across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">There are clear benefits of opening up and facilitating trade and integration – which seem too often forgotten in the public domain these days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">However, it is also evident that the most sustainable overall welfare gains are only seen when sufficient attention is given to redistribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.08,0)">Inequality is a cause for concern, not just in many Latin American countries but also in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We also reflected on global financial governance and the Eminent Persons Group   report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The EPG recommendations are comprehensive and far-reaching.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Reform proposals cover many issues: Development Capital flows and financial stability Risk surveillance Enhancing the Global Financial Safety Net and Governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The proposals have varying degrees of ambition and detail, and the same is true for the follow-up work in the G20 and in other fora.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">We reviewed the proposals on the table, most notably on strengthening global financial resilience through increased surveillance, particularly of risks, and through better integrated advice on monetary policy, macroprudential policy and capital flow measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.57,0)">While we acknowledged that all of the topics covered in the report are clearly relevant, approaches to address them are at times controversial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.78,0)">We also discussed the role of central banks, which is limited given their domestic mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Still, there is recognition that, for example, capital-sending countries have a stake in global financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.97,0)">Major central banks, including the ECB, are therefore analysing the impact of monetary policy spillovers on financial markets and international capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Driving forces behind many topics discussed are international organisations, often cooperating with each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.7,0)">There were also some concerns on the process and the fact that it is mostly driven by the G20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Given the large number of topics, there was also some discussion on whether some prioritisation is desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">More generally, in some areas further work and analysis is needed to strengthen our understanding of underlying issues, before the right reforms can be formulated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.49,0)">But don’t get me wrong: more analysis cannot be a pretext for inaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">In fact, there was a general consensus that progress is needed on many issues mentioned in the EPG report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The discussion also highlighted that cooperation and multilateralism are key to finding solutions, even if many of the problems also need to be addressed at the domestic level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.81,0)">Turning to global financial stability, its environment is challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.2,0)">Risks are increasing and economic growth in many countries is slowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.09,0)">We identified some of the major vulnerabilities, many of which, common to most countries around the table, such as high indebtedness, signs of mispricing of financial assets and increased risk-taking in the non-bank financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.46,0)">Risks differ in some cases and include political instability, capital flow volatility, high levels of non-performing loans or low bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">It is crucial for us to not only directly address the visible vulnerabilities, but also to prepare for the unpredictable events by strengthening resilience in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Important actions in this regard are: the full and timely implementation of international bank regulation standards; countercyclical macroprudential policies for banks; appropriate regulatory and macroprudential frameworks in the non-banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">We finally also widened the concept to include not only financial but also economic resilience to promote economic and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">There is no one-size-fits-all solution, but any policy mix requires adequate macroprudential, fiscal and structural elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.25,0)">Finding the right policy mix is a complex exercise, but the real obstacles are usually institutional, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">getting political approval and ensuring implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">We also reflected on the role of central banks and international organisations in helping to strengthen resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">While acting within their mandate central bank tasks have generally widened and expectations for action on a wide range of issues have increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Our discussions were not only pleasant but insightful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The meeting also confirmed that Latin America is an important partner for us in Europe in this changing world and demonstrated the value of our bilateral and multilateral cooperation.</span><span style="background-color:
