    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)"> One year of SSM Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, at an international conference on "One year of SSM effective and efficient supervision in a volatile world?"</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">organised by the Institute of Law and Finance, Frankfurt, Germany, 2 November 2015 Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me thank the organisers of this conference for their kind invitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">I very much welcome this opportunity to share our experience of one year Single Supervisory Mechanism, in particular as our first year anniversary is only two days ahead of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Back in November 2014, in a speech for the start of the Single Supervisory Mechanism  , I compared the new system, the SSM, to an athlete at the start of his career.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We only had a short period of training before going into our first competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Today, almost one year later, we have gained experience and won some contests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me mention some figures to give you some insight into the sport we practice: The SSM directly supervises 122 banking groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">From January 2016 onwards this number will increase to 130.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The balance sheets of these banks count for 25 trillion euro in assets and 82% of the banking business done in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Overall, the ECB issued more than 1.200 supervisory decisions last year; our planning cycle for the first year included more than 8.000 activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Not only did we hire 1.000 new staff members at the ECB, but we also integrated 5.000 staff members from 26 national supervisory authorities, who were formerly responsible for supervision in their home country, into the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Since November 2014, the SSM is responsible for directly supervising 1200 individual banks, which until that point in time had been supervised according to 19 national interpretations of European law and according to specific national regulations, following a national supervisory tradition with varying degrees of quantitative and qualitative elements, with a historically grown reporting universe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">It was a busy first year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">And it was a successful first year as we made progress on many fronts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We achieved a lot regarding our main objective: we improved the resilience of 122 significant banking groups, of the 19 national banking systems, and of the European banking system as whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The comprehensive assessment was the most publicly visible success, but many smaller and less visible steps followed and will still follow on our way to a safer and more sound banking system in the Euro Area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As the SSM changed the way supervision addresses problems and communicates what it expects to be done by banks, it also changed the timing and the way banks, their management and their owners acknowledge shortcomings and find solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">One important step led to a common methodology for the supervisory review and evaluation process, the core of supervisory activities and the basis for the capital level the SSM expects a bank to hold according to its individual risk profile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Starting with 19 different supervisory practices and information levels, it was pivotal to set a basis of quantitative as well as qualitative information about individual banks and the differences in national banking systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">We can now reap the fruit from having a single European supervisor by moving our capacity for benchmarking to a European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">But it was not only a busy year, it was a very special year, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Everything we decided, we decided for first time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Everything we did set a precedent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.93,0)">Thus, everything had to be discussed in the Supervisory Board of the SSM, consisting of the representatives of the 26 national supervisory authorities as well as of 6 ECB representatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We formulated supervisory policies in many major areas, for example large exposure limits, the fitness and properness of board members, conditions for changes in qualifying holdings, prerequisites for capital reductions and issuances, model approvals, capital and liquidity waivers, IPS etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We also discussed and agreed on concepts and processes for supervisory planning, onsite inspections, risk analysis, reporting of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Integrating 19 national supervisory cultures and traditions with a wide range of administrative practices demanded and still demands organisational and methodological rigour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.41,0)">This rigour is sometimes misinterpreted as being not proportional or not in line with qualitative supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">But common concepts and methods have helped and are helping us to put in place the fundamental pillars of a truly European supervisory approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Some stakeholders had grown fond of some habits and customs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Those customs had to be abandoned to make room for a new common approach, as the objective of the SSM is not to preserve 19 national approaches but to foster convergence towards best standards of supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is not my intention to only look back at our past achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We cannot lean back and hope for easy wins in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.51,0)">There are still a lot of challenges ahead of us, which we have to face and address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.98,0)">First, there are issues for which we still lack a common approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">For example, what are our expectations regarding banks’ liquidity risk management?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">What contingency planning do we expect from banks for outsourced services?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">To answer these questions, we will establish common administrative practices via the already described process of collecting national and international best administrative practices, of benchmarking concepts and by taking into account the lessons learnt from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Second, we need to further refine our benchmarking by using the knowledge we gained last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Last year, we had to be tough on banks and on us to collect a lot of harmonised quantitative as well as qualitative information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">This was necessary to lay the foundation for our work and to exploit that we are one of the biggest supervisors of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">We are exceptionally well placed to look for the best practices and to identify emerging risks by using our unique database.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Good benchmarking combines strong analysis and data-driven assessment with expert judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">It allows taking into account the specificities of individual banks while still fostering consistency of assessments across banks and countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Good benchmarking looks at risks from multiple perspectives and helps to develop a deep, holistic understanding of each institution’s overall risk profile and viability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Third, we need to further analyse in detail and for each topic individually where we are able to create a harmonized approach within the SSM, where we are able to remove uneven playing fields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We already did so for the options and national discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In November we will consult on the legal text we drafted for executing the discretion given to us regarding the 122 OND identified and decided upon by the SB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Apart from the famous ONDs, the current legal environment in which we operate is characterised by many different interpretations and national gold plating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In this context, we face a particular challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.67,0)">It goes without saying that the SSM applies national law; consequently, the SSM is not always able to ensure a level playing field when national laws diverge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.12,0)">Things get even more difficult when national supervisory practices are transferred into national law limiting the usual range of discretion needed by a supervisor to correctly do his job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">These new national rules risk not removing but creating new elements of fragmentation and supervisory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude by recalling a key lesson from the recent financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.55,0)">The crises did not solely result from weaknesses in the regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.98,0)">It is important to remember that the supervision of banks did not function optimally, either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We can all agree that banks should be subject to consistent prudential requirements based on their business model, risk profile and governance arrangements; to only name the most important characteristics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.71,0)">Prudential requirements should not be driven by the location of a bank’s business or headquarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Ultimately, banks which face comparable economic and financial conditions should receive the same supervisory treatment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This is why a truly European Banking supervisor, the SSM, was created.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The SSM’s first year of supervision was overall a successful one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.6,0)">But we continue to face challenges so there is no reason at all to stop training.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We have to stay vigilant and keep on with the work we have started.</span>
