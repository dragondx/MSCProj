    <span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)"> Monetary policy in the crisis – Confronting short-run challenges while anchoring long-run expectations Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the Journées de l’AFSE 2013 - La crise de l’Union Economique et Monétaire  : Enjeux théoriques et perspectives de politique économiqueUniversité d’Orléans, 17 May 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen, dear colleagues,   It is a great pleasure to speak to you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">I would like to use this opportunity to reflect on a fundamental tension lying at the heart of monetary policy: A central bank’s success in ensuring macroeconomic stability depends on it having a credible commitment to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">And to build and nurture such credibility, it should have a track record of responding in a consistent, transparent and predictable way to shocks hitting the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.21,0)">At the same time, financial and macroeconomic disturbances are sometimes of a scale and complexity that they alter the underlying structural relationships between key economic variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">This, in turn, challenges monetary policy-makers to temporarily adapt their established strategies to a new environment without undermining their inflation-fighting credentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.1,0)">The current crisis provides a salient case study of such a tension: starting with a loss of confidence in the solvency of certain financial institutions, the crisis quickly morphed into a broad-based impairment of private financial intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.62,0)">As a consequence, the link between monetary policy impulses and economic aggregates – which is the structural relationship most relevant for central banks – was severely affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Confronted with this new environment, central banks across the globe have expanded their toolkits to compensate for their reduced influence on economic outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The measures they took have in many cases helped to stabilise the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.04,0)">But they have also triggered a lively debate on where to draw the line between crisis-fighting efforts on the one hand – and a general departure from established principles of monetary policy on the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">I would like to consider how central banks can resolve the tension between anchoring long-term expectations and flexibly confronting short-term challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">I will argue that the key to success lies in a clear-cut hierarchy between the different elements of a monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In doing so, I will highlight two distinct elements: the objective of policy and the conduct of policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The monetary policy objective of a central bank should always be the overriding concern and guiding principle of any policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Building on the credibility that derives from having a firm and stable commitment to its objective, the central bank should then flexibly tailor its policy conduct to the specific macroeconomic disturbances that it has to face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">As I will demonstrate, the ECB’s monetary policy strategy during the crisis has consistently taken this approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Elements of a monetary policy strategy Let me first briefly expand on the distinction between the different elements of a monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What I refer to as monetary policy objectives are the overarching economic goals of a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">For most central banks around the globe, these goals include – as a primary component – the pursuit of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This objective is often complemented by ancillary policy preoccupations, such as minimising deviations from sustainable growth and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In the modern central banking universe that has emerged since the macroeconomic failures of the 1970s, no one would doubt that while price stability is a desirable medium-term goal for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Avoiding excessive economic fluctuations around the trend and minimising financial instability, however, often has a different status.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">These objectives are ancillary because they have more to do with the path to the medium-term objective – a path that should minimise unnecessary fluctuations under way – than with the medium-term objective itself, which remains price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">That being said, central banks attach different priorities to these ancillary policy goals as they seek to steer the economy to its steady state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the US, for instance, the Federal Reserve System has a dual mandate: maximum employment and stable prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">By contrast, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union clearly specifies price stability as the primary objective for the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.57,0)">I will come back to this distinction between the Eurosystem and the Federal Reserve at a later stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.47,0)">The conduct of monetary policy refers to the way a central bank goes about achieving its objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This usually includes systematic monitoring of specific indicators or macroeconomic aggregates that the central bank uses as guideposts towards its final objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The aggregates are chosen because of their close empirical association with the variables underlying the ultimate monetary policy objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.24,0)">They may include, for example, broad monetary aggregates or market interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In addition, the policy conduct involves certain instruments which a central bank uses to steer the financial conditions under its direct control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.12,0)">These include reserve requirements, the monetary base, as well as the key interest rates at which the central bank provides liquidity to market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.96,0)">Changes in monetary policy strategy have very different implications, depending on which of these two constituent elements – policy objectives or policy conduct – they affect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.98,0)">From a practical perspective, objectives are more difficult to change, inter alia, because they are usually enshrined in law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.57,0)">By contrast, the conduct of policy is, to a large extent, at the discretion of the respective central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In the euro area, for example, the price stability objective has “constitutional” status: it is explicitly laid down in Article 127  of the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">At the same time, the institutional framework leaves considerable scope for the Eurosystem to calibrate its policy measures so that it achieves its price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There is one exception to this general fact, which I will turn to soon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Interactions between the conduct of monetary policy and its objectives The success of a monetary policy strategy depends on the interaction between these elements: the more credible a central bank’s commitment to its objective, the more flexibly it can adjust its monetary policy conduct to specific challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">There are two reasons for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">First, if expectations are firmly anchored by the central bank’s objective, short-term “innovations” in policy conduct will not induce market participants to fundamentally re-assess their anticipations of where the economy will stabilise in the medium term, when all the current shocks have dissipated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is particularly relevant in crises when the central bank is prompted to expand its toolbox so as to confront exceptional circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.61,0)">By contrast, without a firm commitment to its objective, the adoption of new, temporary instruments may be misinterpreted as a profound shift in the central bank’s overall strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.28,0)">And this can change the way society perceives the basic parameters of the monetary policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.22,0)">Inflation expectations – one prominent parameter of how the regime is perceived by the public – can become unanchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Second, a credible commitment to the objective allows a central bank to tailor the strength and timing of its monetary policy response more specifically to the shocks that hit the economy from time to time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.04,0)">Macroeconomic disturbances can be broadly categorised according to whether they affect mainly the demand side or the supply side of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.89,0)">In the case of a negative demand shock, both economic activity and inflation will tend to fall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.39,0)">Typically, a financial crisis is one example of a negative demand shock: credit conditions are restricted, aggregate demand is restrained and firms are encouraged to undercut their competitors, thereby exerting downward pressure on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">To the extent warranted by the magnitude of the shock, the central bank thus faces an unambiguous policy prescription, namely to provide additional monetary accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.08,0)">In the case of a negative supply shock, the central bank has a policy dilemma as economic activity and inflation move in opposite directions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.19,0)">A drop in productivity is a case in point: an increase in companies’ cost per unit of output makes production less rewarding, and thus lowers the amount of goods and services supplied relative to demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.26,0)">Here, the central bank either temporarily accepts higher inflation, or – in an attempt to keep inflation right on target – it reinforces the disturbance driving down output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">But this trade-off is weakened when the central bank can credibly commit to its price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Knowing that the steady state remains the ultimate goal of policy, private agents will not factor in the temporary increase in inflation into their price- and wage-setting behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">As a consequence, the central bank can afford a more measured conduct of policy in the face of a negative supply side shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Of course, this is not to say that central banks have carte blanche to adopt any tool or tactic that may appear suitable for dealing with any short-run challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.14,0)">The way policy is conducted can, in itself, impinge on the central bank’s credibility to meet its objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.38,0)">One example is the monetary financing of fiscal deficits, which may severely undermine the capacity of a central bank to freely decide on an appropriate course of action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The flexibility of policy conduct is clearly limited to those measures that preserve the central bank’s room for manoeuvre to independently determine its monetary policy stance – now and in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">To summarise, for a central bank to be able to confront short-run challenges while anchoring long-run expectations, it must stick to three principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">First, it has to consistently and unambiguously align any policy action with a clearly specified objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Second, it has to adjust its policy conduct flexibly to the specific nature of the macroeconomic shocks hitting the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.27,0)">And third, in doing so it has to design its policy conduct in a way that does not bind its hands and thus possibly jeopardise its medium-term policy objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The monetary policy strategy of the ECB Let me relate this analysis to the monetary policy strategy of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As I mentioned earlier, the Treaty unambiguously establishes price stability as the primary objective of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">On this basis, the Governing Council has communicated an explicit definition of price stability, namely a range of positive inflation rates below 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is a range at which inflation does not distort the allocation of resources in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Since the inception of the euro the Governing Council has broadly fulfilled this mandate since the growth rate of the euro area harmonised index of consumer prices has been on average 2.07%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This clear objective, together with the ECB’s track record, has firmly anchored inflation expectations in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.24,0)">Since 1999, the average inflation expectation by professional forecasters at a five year horizon has been on average 1.91%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In our framework, inflation is obviously an indicator of pre-eminent policy relevance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.94,0)">But it is not the only one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.4,0)">In conducting its policy, the ECB has looked at a broader set of indicators which from time to time have released signals which conflicted with those which we extracted from our inflation forecast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Under our monetary pillar, in particular, monetary and financial trends have acquired such a prominent analytical status that, we think, they allowed a better identification of the origin of macroeconomic disturbances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This in turn has provided for a more robust approach to policy overall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This monetary pillar “spare tyre” has been relevant in conditions of persistent supply shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me give an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.61,0)">Since the 1990s and for much of the last decade, inflation in a large number of mature industrial economies remained quiescent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Many underlying determinants can explain these worldwide conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">A regained control of inflation expectations by the major monetary authorities was certainly a prime cause of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">But other factors contributed to a sustained trend of disinflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.36,0)">They include the delayed impact on productivity of the digital and internet revolutions that burst upon the scene in the early 1990s as well as the supply chain implications of China’s emergence as the world’s manufacturing powerhouse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Positive supply side shocks were either generated domestically or imported through an expanded trade intensity of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.01,0)">In the euro area, despite the upward pressures that the ongoing adjustment in relative price levels across Member States was exerting on the euro area price index, “price pressures”- defined as the difference between the year-on-year harmonised inflation rate observed in each quarter and the upper ceiling of our price stability range of 2% - were absent or even negative in the years preceding the Lehman debacle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Had the ECB relied on inflation as a summary statistic of the state of the economy, the conclusion would have been that the economy had reached an ideal state of balanced, non-inflationary growth – the “Great Moderation”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Our monetary pillar was sending a quite different signal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The growth rate of the broad monetary aggregate M3 doubled during the recovery that followed the bursting of the dot-com bubble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.27,0)">At the same time, premia paid by borrowers on various categories of debt contracts had plunged to levels unseen in the recent history of finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Credit growth closely followed the rampant growth rate of M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.9,0)">These indicators – which are an integral part of our monetary analysis – were sounding the alarm in an otherwise complacent policy environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.41,0)">The resulting cacophony of indicators gave some headaches to the ECB staff who had to interpret them and also to policy-makers, who were forced to challenge the rosy outlook offered by the mainstream narratives of the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.33,0)">Now, in retrospect, we know that the undertone played by the monetary analysis, which appeared so much out of tune at the time, was in fact the counterpoint, the hidden score of financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.94,0)">Lehman’s demise and what followed revealed the score of the hidden voice, and its drama.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.75,0)">The moral I draw from this episode is the following.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">The price stability objective needs to be reinforced, in the day-to-day conduct of policy, by an intense strategic focus on monetary and financial indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.41,0)">When financial markets create excessive leverage – too much credit – and engage in imprudent maturity transformation – too much bank money – reacting to financial booms under the monetary pillar will not only ensure price stability but also counteract the build-up of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Vice versa, very subdued credit dynamics, such as those we are currently observing, provide crucial signals of how long the accommodative monetary stance is warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This probably requires a better understanding of the ebb and flow of liquidity and the drivers of endogenous money creation inside the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But the possibility of activating this fail-safe policy mechanism largely depends on how the price stability objective is defined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The fact that inflation can move within a certain range is an important pre-condition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Indeed, the Governing Council’s specification of the ECB’s primary objective has two characteristic features, which complement its monetary pillar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">First, it is a range of values, not a point target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Second, it is based on a medium-term orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.2,0)">This has two implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">First, there is some flexibility as to where inflation could be within the range at any point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">In 2003 the Governing Council announced that within the range of inflation rates consistent with price stability, a rate “close to 2%” should be the aim of policy in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">But there is scope for inflation to vary within the range along the way to convergence with the medium-term policy aim, and many path configurations are possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.21,0)">Second, the medium term itself is not a pre-set time span, but it is dependent on the underlying shocks that may explain inflation dynamics from time to time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.32,0)">The former type of discretion – related to the path of convergence of inflation to its medium-term level – is critical when supply shocks are positive, that is, expansionary and disinflationary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This dimension of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy is not always appreciated, but is important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">When inflation pressures are absent or negative and positive shocks to aggregate supply feed financial buoyancy – the conditions which prevailed in the late 1990s and for a good part of the 2000s – having a range definition of price stability, rather than, say, a point target, is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.67,0)">The possibility of letting inflation temporarily drift down within its price stability range when faced with clear signs of financial exuberance increases the chances of hitting the inflation objective over the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The latter type of discretion – related to the time horizon – is crucial in the presence of transitory negative supply shocks and demand shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.96,0)">For example, a cost-push shock deriving from a spike in commodity prices pushes measured inflation upwards and is a drain on demand and economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">In the face of such a disturbance, the medium-term horizon affords some time for the shock to work its way through the economy and allows the ECB to “look through” it to a time when the shock is forecast to have subsided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">This in turn ensures that the central bank is not forced to introduce further macroeconomic volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.14,0)">As for a demand shock, the policy-relevant time horizon shrinks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.47,0)">A negative demand shock which is recessionary and potentially deflationary will have to be counteracted quickly and forcefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.04,0)">This is in fact what the ECB did during the most acute phases of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This is what we have to do if confronted with severe downside risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Against this background, let me briefly come back to the comparison between the ECB’s monetary policy framework and that of the Federal Reserve System in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As mentioned earlier, the mandates of these two central banks differ: the ECB’s framework entails a clear ordering of objectives in which price stability ranks first, whereas the Fed’s dual mandate focuses on both price stability and maximum employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.75,0)">Some observers have invoked this difference in mandates to argue that the ECB is, by comparison, not well placed to support employment and growth in downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.36,0)">But, in fact, this argument overstates the practical difference in policy-making arising from these different mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">To see this, we should bear in mind that monetary policy can only support real economic aggregates in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">By contrast, long-term economic growth is determined by the structural characteristics of the economy, including the supply of labour and capital, as well as overall productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Any attempt by monetary policy to permanently lift the economy above the growth potential determined by these factors is bound to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The Fed’s dual mandate is not at odds with this principle, I believe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.94,0)">As I read it, the employment dimension of the Fed’s dual mandate is not meant to influence the structural path of unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In fact, as I said before, it serves as an explicit acknowledgement that the central bank will be wary of employment dynamics when steering output back to its structural path after economic shocks have perturbed labour market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">But, as I just explained, the ECB’s price stability definition and policy horizon also allow for substantial flexibility in calibrating the policy response to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Due to this flexibility, the ECB can pursue its long-term price stability objective without triggering socially costly short-run fluctuations in output and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In this regard, it is in line with the key purpose of the Fed’s dual mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The ECB’s crisis response In the euro area crisis, the ECB’s capacity to react flexibly within its stable framework has been tested exhaustively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.91,0)">One challenge that has rendered this crisis particularly complex is financial fragmentation between Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.19,0)">Two equally sound and productive businesses incur distinctly different costs of capital depending on whether they are located in an economically vulnerable country or in a more stable country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">However, funding conditions for firms and households constitute a key channel through which monetary policy impulses translate into consumption and investment decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.31,0)">As a consequence, changes in our main policy rates have had uneven effects across countries, thus undermining the singleness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The ECB has responded to this with a range of non-standard monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In doing so, it has adopted solutions that have addressed the specific short-run challenges, while reconfirming its medium-term price stability commitment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.57,0)">Let me give three examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">The two 3-year very long term refinancing operations   that we launched in late 2011 and early 2012 aimed to alleviate adverse funding conditions for banks which were unable to satisfy their additional liquidity needs in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">By removing the liquidity constraints on credit supply, it has avoided a major credit crunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.82,0)">Without the launch of the two refinancing operations, banks would have defaulted on their obligations coming due in the market, or would have discontinued and withdrawn existing credit lines to companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The liquidity injection was on a large scale, amounting to around €520 billion – taking into account the shifting of liquidity out of other operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">It helped to counteract the fragmentation, in that a large share of the overall liquidity uptake under the VLTROs came from banks in vulnerable countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.32,0)">At the same time, the interest rate on these operations is indexed to the ECB’s main policy rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.26,0)">Thus, if the ECB were to change this rate for monetary policy reasons, the costs for the remaining period of the three-year VLTROs would also change accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.84,0)">Hence, the three-year liquidity provision which took place at times of extreme stress does not hamper the ECB’s capability to transmit changes in short-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In a similar vein, the programme for Outright Monetary Transactions has been designed with a view to combatting fragmentation while preserving the credibility of the ECB’s monetary policy objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">By being tied to an effective macroeconomic adjustment programme, the initiative prevents the intervention on government debt markets to eliminate “redenomination risk” – the unwarranted perception of a risk of euro breakup - from becoming a subsidy for unsustainable national policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.89,0)">The European Stability Mechanism will impose on sovereign issuers the same solvency conditions as those imposed by the ECB on banks when it provides them with liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">And sovereign solvency is a necessary condition to avoid fiscal dominance on monetary policy, and thereby for the ECB to fulfil its medium term objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">A third example is the ECB’s action to improve the transmission to the real economy of the impulsions provided by the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The broadening of the range of assets accepted as collateral to monetary policy operations makes it possible for euro area banks to better mobilise claims on the real economy, and therefore to lend more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The ECB is today exploring options to further strengthen lending to the real economy and, in particular, to small and medium-sized enterprises, which form the backbone of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.19,0)">But the ECB can only act within its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.52,0)">Assuming non-profitable assets today present in the balance sheets of banks, or seeking to artificially eliminate differences in financing costs arising from different risk environment or from insufficient capital would amount to substituting actions not taken by other actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.55,0)">This would be to the detriment of the central bank’s independence and freedom of action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">To sum up, the ECB has stringently followed the guidelines necessary to confront short-run challenges while anchoring long-run expectations, and it will continue to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.42,0)">The crisis has exposed the balancing act lying at the heart of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">On the one hand, central banks are key participants in addressing short-term challenges that the economy faces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">On the other hand, their crisis-fighting efforts have to be designed and communicated in full consistence with their long-run price stability mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">To successfully manage this balancing act, monetary policy-makers must clearly distinguish between their objective, which serves to firmly anchor market expectations, and their conduct of policy, which should flexibly adjust to the specific challenges at hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The ECB’s strategic framework contains the necessary elements to achieve this balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Financial conditions have generally improved in the euro area over recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The ECB will continue to effectively accompany the recovery that should materialise provided that reform efforts continue both at the level of each euro area economy and to strengthen the governance and efficiency of our economic and monetary union.</span>
