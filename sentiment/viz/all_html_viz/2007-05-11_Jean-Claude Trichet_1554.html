    <span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)"> The current state of European financial integration Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat the invitation of the University of StirlingStirling, Scotland, United Kingdom11 May 2007 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to again thank the University of Stirling for the honour of having appointed me, some few hours ago, as Doctor honoris causa of this highly esteemed university, located in the heart of Scotland, in these beautiful surroundings just between the Scottish Lowlands and the slopes of the Highlands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">I would also like to thank the university for organising this dinner with the Scottish business and financial community, under the chairmanship of Dr. Callum McCarthy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">In the more recent past, the European Monetary Union has led to the creation of a new currency, the euro, which has been adopted by 13 European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Today, I would like to share with you some thoughts on the benefits that our new currency, the euro, has brought to the European economy through the process of European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">With my remarks, I basically aim to sketch out some features that we consider to be important in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">At the same time, I would like to stimulate your interest and invite the academic world to undertake research and economic analyses on this matter that is of fundamental importance to the European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">So let me start by telling you that the ECB has adopted a definition of financial integration: we consider a market for a given set of financial instruments and/or services to be integrated if all potential market participants with the same relevant characteristics   face a single set of rules when they decide to trade in those instruments and/or services,   have equal access to the set of instruments and/or services, and   are treated equally when they are active in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Furthermore, I would like to mention a related but also distinct concept, namely the one of financial development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Financial development   refers to the process of financial innovation and organisational improvements in the financial system that reduces asymmetric information, increases the completeness of markets, increases opportunities for agents to engage in financial transactions through   contracts, reduces transaction costs and increases competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">These definitions lead me to pose two basic questions: What are the economic benefits from European financial integration and development?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">What are the main achievements as well as the potential, remaining obstacles for further financial integration in Europe, and are there initiatives underway that address them?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In this respect, I would like to draw your attention to a new report entitled “Financial integration in Europe”  , which the ECB published for the first time at the end of March and to which I will also refer in my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I will structure my remarks into two parts, in which I will try to answer the two questions that I have posed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The economic benefits from European financial integration and development With respect to the economic benefits from financial integration and financial development, I would like to distinguish three implications, for   monetary policy,   the stability of the financial system, and   economic growth and welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The impact of financial integration on monetary policy Financial integration is of key importance for the ECB, given the relevance for the conduct of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">To start with, let me argue that the euro area money market is highly integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The ECB monitors the state of financial integration for the different financial market segments on the basis of a set of quantitative indicators that the ECB has developed and which are described in the new report I mentioned earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In a nutshell, the evidence confirms that the degree of integration varies according to the market segment, and that integration is generally more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">In particular, the unsecured money market reached a stage of “near-perfect” integration almost immediately after the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.75,0)">One of our indicators, the cross-country standard deviation of the average overnight lending rates among euro area countries, was as low as three basis points already in early 1999 and has since decreased to between one and two basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">There is another dimension that is of relevance for the effective and efficient conduct of monetary policy: the monetary policy transmission mechanism, which encompasses the different interest rates set by the banks in the euro area countries for the financial products, such as for example the interest rate on a mortgage loan that a bank offers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Generally speaking, highly integrated and developed financial markets allow economic agents to share risks more effectively, thus improving the ability of firms and households to offset the consequences of idiosyncratic shocks that could affect the national economies of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">With more integrated financial markets, the dynamic adjustments to such shocks are likely to be more similar across the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Since monetary policy decisions are implemented and transmitted through the financial system, the degree of financial integration affects the effectiveness of this transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I would like to mention in this context that the Eurosystem Monetary Transmission Network, which is a network composed of the ECB and national central banks of the Eurosystem, conducted an in-depth analysis of the transmission mechanism a few years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The main finding was that the monetary transmission mechanism operated in a broadly similar way in each euro area country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">At the same time, the analysis suggested that some of the remaining differences could eventually be related to financial factors and the degree of integration of financial markets across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Also some research by ECB staff   indicates that there are still differences in bank deposit and lending interest rates across euro area countries, whose cross-country dispersion is higher than the intra-regional dispersion of the same rates in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.26,0)">However, it is still an open question whether the remaining heterogeneity of financing conditions observed across euro area countries reflects a lack of financial integration in the euro area or rather other factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For example, recent research presented last November at an ECB conference in Madrid shows that part of this heterogeneity can be explained by the different characteristics of domestic depositors and borrowers on the demand side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.55,0)">The observed cross-country heterogeneity of retail bank rates would therefore not be due to the existence of obstacles to cross-border capital movements or the lack of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">In other words, thanks to the significant progress achieved in the euro area in terms of financial market integration over the past years, financial factors have become less likely to cause differences in the impact of monetary policy transmission across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The impact of financial integration on financial stability With respect to the second implication, namely the impact of financial integration on the stability of the financial system, I note that the merits of having capital flowing freely across borders have, for many years, been subject to an active debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">A number of channels could enhance the stability of financial markets and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">First, the removal of capital controls and financial integration gives access to a wider range of assets and therefore helps to diversify risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Second, integration can make markets larger and more liquid, thereby enhancing their resilience to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Third, the greater liquidity, information acquisition and competitiveness of markets through the entry of foreign participants may contribute to better pricing of financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">And finally, competitive pressure arising from foreign financial institutions entering a country will enhance competition, strengthen market discipline and thereby favour robust and healthy financial institutions in the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Of course, despite the positive effects of financial integration on financial stability, we are also aware of new challenges that arise in a more financially integrated world, such as the greater connection of asset prices that may influence cross-border contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Probably the most famous example of the benefits of financial integration for financial stability is the difference in the number of bank failures during the Great Depression between the United States and Canada, where Canadian banks were larger and faced less banking restrictions than in the U.S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.54,0)">Between 1923 and 1935, no Canadian bank failed, while from 1930 to 1933, more than 9,000 US banks suspended operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">More and more research studies have recently argued in favour of a positive relationship between financial integration and financial stability, especially for financially developed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.39,0)">For example, recent research by ECB staff found that, for all the banking crises in the world between 1980 and 2004, more open countries tend to experience less severe crises than more closed ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.26,0)">For the same period, other studies also show that more competition in the banking sector significantly decreased the probability of systemic banking crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The impact of financial integration on economic growth and welfare I now turn to the next economic implication of financial integration, namely that it raises the economy’s potential for stronger non-inflationary economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">For example, a research study conducted by London Economics a few years ago estimated the benefits of the integration of European bonds and equity markets to be around 1% of additional GDP growth over a ten-year period, or approximately EUR100 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">I would like to mention two possible channels through which financial integration can foster economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">First, financial systems serve to channel funds from those economic agents that have a surplus of savings to those with a shortage; and to trade, hedge, diversify and pool risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">These functions are facilitated by financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">As a result, there is a better sharing and diversification of risk and a greater potential for stronger non-inflationary economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In this respect, it is worth underlining the finding by Asdrubaldi, Sorensen and Yosha     that, in the United States, capital markets would smooth out 39% of the shocks to gross state product  , the credit channel would smooth out 23% of such shocks and the federal government, through the fiscal channel, 13%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.47,0)">Around 25% of the shocks are not smoothed out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Hence, in the United States financial markets and financial institutions would contribute 62% to the absorption of state idiosyncratic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We therefore see from the US example that the financial channel can be much more important than the fiscal channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This is an additional reason to speed up financial integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">In a more recent study, the same authors found that the EU’s situation has begun to converge towards the situation of the United States since the late 1990s and that there is already a still modest but non-negligible insurance through inter-state capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">The authors notably found that in the Euro Area  , capital markets would have smoothed out about 10% of the country-specific shocks to GDP between 1993 and 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">A second channel through which financial integration fosters economic growth is cross-border banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As I mentioned earlier, the integration of banking markets, in particular of the retail component, is less advanced than for example the integration of the euro area money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In this respect, cross-border banks play a key role in the process of banking integration and in the way financial integration affects economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">They enhance competition in the euro area banking markets and provide a channel for the spreading of innovation in financial products and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">They also promote convergence towards more efficient, less costly banking services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The positive effects of cross-border banking are also apparent with respect to the new EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">For example, some authors showed that foreign lending in Central and Eastern Europe stimulates growth in firm sales, assets, and leverage in these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.84,0)">Further research also explains that foreign banks also offer on average lower lending rates than domestic banks, which stimulates investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Foreign bank entry may not only increase the level of output, but also decrease output volatility and dampen the business cycle in the new EU Member States, as the credit supply from foreign banks has also been found on average to be less sensitive to local economic conditions than that from domestic banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">To sum up the effects of financial integration on economic growth, I would like to stress the important role of the euro, whose introduction has brought about huge benefits resulting from increased financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Research presented at an ECB conference in 2005 in Vienna indicates that the introduction of the euro would have been associated with an average increase in the growth rate of physical investment of about 5 percentage points for the Euro Area countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Although this average hides differences across countries  , the euro seems to have had positive effects on investment growth in most Euro Area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">As these findings were particularly strong for industries that depend on external finance  , the author argued that this could be explained by the increase of financial integration after the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The impact of financial development on economic growth Finally, I would like to highlight that as the process of European financial integration is gradually taking place, it is important to also be aware of the related process of financial development and modernisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">By speeding up the reallocation of capital from declining to evolving and promising industries – the Schumpeterian process of “creative destruction” – both processes of financial integration and financial development positively influence the efficiency of a financial system, ultimately leading to a higher potential for economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">There are many channels through which financial development and modernisation may affect economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I will consider three of them:   the depth, or size, of the capital markets,   transparency and information and good corporate governance, and   the impact via the legal system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The size of capital markets has a positive effect on economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Qualitative evidence suggests that in the EU the gains from financial integration and financial development stem not only from increased investment, but also and mainly from increased productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">ECB staff recently found additional evidence that the reallocation of capital from declining industries to industries with high investment opportunities and high productivity is faster in countries with developed financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">For these countries, investment is also more responsive to technical innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">These findings suggest that countries with more liquid capital markets and a developed banking system should grow faster on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Some authors have calculated that if the average size of capital markets in the EU was the same as in the US – that is, broadly 450% of GDP, instead of 220% with an overall indicator measuring total financing in the economy by aggregating bank credit to the private sector, stock market capitalisation and the outstanding amount of domestic debt securities issued by the private sector   – then annual GDP per capita growth in the EU would probably be significantly higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The production and dissemination of information is a crucial part of the functioning of a financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This is the second channel through which financial development and modernisation affect economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">For example, sufficient public reporting by firms alleviates the control problem between outside investors and firm insiders, with beneficial effects on the cost of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.52,0)">In the same vein, corporate governance addresses potential conflicts between investors and firm managers, as well as among investors  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Better governance ensures that their interests are more aligned, so that investors obtain better returns and invest more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.27,0)">For example, some authors using European data have recently shown that deviations from the principle of proportional ownership   lead to lower firm values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Finally, reliability and efficiency of legal systems are also important for the performance of financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.73,0)">The inter-temporal nature of many financial contracts implies that investors relinquish control of their funds for a promise of future cash flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The legal system ensures that such contracts are honoured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Research shows for example that international banks’ investment decisions are sensitive to the enforcement of creditor rights   and that private credit and market capitalisation are strongly correlated with the enforcement of shareholder rights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Achievements, challenges and ongoing initiatives to advance European financial integration I would now like to turn to the second part of my speech and move from the economic analysis of the implications of financial integration and development to some very practical initiatives aimed at fostering further progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">In this respect, I would like to highlight some major achievements, some remaining challenges and some concrete initiatives underway to address these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I will structure this along the different segments of the financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">I mentioned earlier that the euro area unsecured money market is integrated to a nearly perfect extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">This success has also been sustained by the high degree of integration of the large-value payment systems, to which our so-called TARGET system – which has been available since the very start of Monetary Union – contributes in an important way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The launch of the single currency necessitated a real-time payment system for the euro area to provide the payment procedures necessary for implementing the ECB’s single monetary policy, and to promote sound and efficient payment mechanisms in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">TARGET is the real-time gross settlement   system for the euro offered by the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It is used for the settlement of central bank operations, large-value euro interbank transfers as well as other euro payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">To better meet the users’ long-term needs and prepare for the enlargement of the euro area, the Eurosystem is currently developing the next generation of TARGET, namely TARGET2.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The launch of this single technical platform in November this year will promote further financial integration, in particular through a harmonised service level, a single price structure, and a harmonised set of cash settlement services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">It is, however, also true that the euro area short-term debt securities market has witnessed only a limited degree of cross-border activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.44,0)">This may partly be due to the fact that short-term debt securities issued by euro area residents have very similar risk characteristics and therefore offer little scope for international diversification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Our respective indicator, which gives the share of short-term debt securities issued by euro area residents and held by other euro area residents, shows a rising trend – from 7% in 2001 to over 12% in 2005 – but the absolute numbers are small when compared with the corresponding indicators for the bond and equity markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">With respect to the absolute size of the short-term debt securities market, I would like to highlight the Short-Term European Paper   initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">This initiative by the European banking industry promotes the development of a pan-European short-term paper market through market players’ voluntary compliance with a core set of standards encompassed in the STEP Market Convention, which was signed in June 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">By the end of March this year, 35 STEP-compliant programmes, amounting to €201 billion, had been launched under the STEP label.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.23,0)">The ECB regularly produces statistics on yields and volumes in the STEP market and publishes them on its website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">With respect to bond markets, euro area cross-border holdings of long-term debt securities have increased strongly – from about 10% at the end of the 1990s to nearly 60% in 2005 – suggesting that investors are increasingly diversifying their portfolios across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As a way of testing the idea that, in integrated markets, bond yields should react to common factors, rather than local ones, one can also make a regression of changes in yields of individual government bonds against changes in yields of a benchmark bond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">In the ECB’s new report, we show that the estimated coefficients of this regression varied substantially up to 1998, but converged afterwards towards 1, which is the level of perfect integration, suggesting that the euro area government bond market has reached a very advanced stage of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But let me stress an important point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It has to be borne in mind that movements related to changes in the credit risk perceptions by the market do not signal a variation in the degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.06,0)">Such “local news” will continue to have an impact on bond yields in different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Integration of European government bond markets means that yields converge across countries to the extent that the underlying bonds have identical risk-return characteristics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.94,0)">A government bond of a country with a higher fiscal deficit is riskier than a government bond of a country with a lower deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Consequently, it is to be expected that yields in the first case are higher than government bond yields of the country with a lower deficit, even with perfect integration of government bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">There is, therefore, no contradiction between integrated markets, as shown by our indicators, and the ECB’s view that markets should accurately price different budgetary policies into bond yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Finally, the quantity-based measure of euro area equity market integration also indicates a rising degree of integration in the equity markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Between 1997 and 2005 euro area residents doubled their holdings of equity issued in another euro area country to nearly 30%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">This implies that, following the introduction of the euro, euro area investors have partially reallocated their equity portfolio from domestic holdings to holdings elsewhere within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.03,0)">As a remaining challenge to the integration of euro area securities markets, I note that the euro area securities clearing and settlement infrastructure underpinning both bond and equity markets is not yet sufficiently integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Several initiatives to achieve an efficient and integrated market infrastructure are underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Last November, for example, at the European Commission’s request, the relevant European industry associations and their members signed a “ European Code of Conduct for Clearing and Settlement”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The Code represents the first self-regulatory approach in the area of EU clearing and settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The ECB welcomes this initiative and acknowledges the commitment by the industry to implement the Code.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In this respect, let me also mention that the Eurosystem is considering developing a single platform for the settlement of securities in central bank money – the so-called TARGET2-Securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.09,0)">The scope of this project is restricted to the settlement layer of the post-trading activity regarding securities settled in central bank money and does not involve custody services and other activities, which remain separate economic activities performed by the central securities depositories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Our next step will now be the definition of user requirements, and these will benefit from a public consultation which we launched on 26 April 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Last but not least, I would like to mention the European retail banking markets which also still display fragmentation in their retail payment infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The introduction of the euro as the single currency of the euro area will only be completed when consumers, businesses and governments are able to make cashless payments throughout the euro area from a single payment account anywhere in the euro area using a single set of payment instruments as easily, efficiently and safely as they can make payments today in the domestic context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">However, we also see progress in this field as the current fragmentation of the European retail payment infrastructures is being addressed by the so-called Single Euro Payments Area   project that has been initiated by the European banking industry with a view to creating a Single Euro Payments Area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">SEPA can be described as an integrated market for payment services which is subject to effective competition and where there is no distinction between cross-border and national payments within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Improved payment service levels will benefit the end-users with transparent prices and cost-efficient services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">SEPA will allow the payments industry to become more efficient, thereby providing significant savings and benefits to the wider European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The Eurosystem supports this project in a catalyst role, by providing guidance to banks and the payments industry in setting objectives and defining high-level requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">I am very glad to report that the self-regulatory approach chosen for SEPA is working well and that we expect the European banking industry to launch the first SEPA instruments according to schedule on 1 January 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Concluding remarks Ladies and gentlemen, This brings me to the end of my remarks in which I have sketched out the basic economic implications of the process of European financial integration and development as well as some of the major achievements, remaining challenges and initiatives underway.</span><span style="background-color:
