    <span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)"> Financial globalisation and integration: What’s next?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">A forward-looking perspective Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBConference on “Financial Globalisation and Integration”Frankfurt am Main, 17-18 July 2006 Introduction It is a great pleasure for me to present the closing remarks of this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I don’t think it would be fruitful to touch upon every issue that this conference has addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I would rather focus my intervention on the role of public policy, in particular institution building, in the adjustment of global economic and financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Being the last speaker, I would like to start by putting some of the findings presented over the last two days in the context of the ongoing policy debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I will then turn to the main focus of my speech – the role that institution building, especially in emerging markets, can play in the adjustment process going forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.45,0)">Policy debate Economic and financial imbalances between the main economic regions of the world continue to widen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.91,0)">This is hardly sustainable over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.65,0)">The case for a policy adjustment becomes more and more relevant as it is increasingly risky to assume that market forces alone can foster the necessary adjustment without a significant cost to the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The policy assignment, agreed in international fora such as the G7 foresees that: the U.S. should reduce domestic absorption, in particular through fiscal consolidation; Europe and Japan should focus on structural reforms that would increase GDP growth and boost domestic demand; Asia and other emerging economies should enhance flexibility of their exchange rate regimes and foster domestic absorption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Such a message is consistent with what we have learned in this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Further evidence supporting such a coordinated adjustment effort has been provided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Several conference papers   find that reductions in the government deficits do lead to improvements in external balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">This evidence can be added to the existing empirical literature suggesting that a policy of fiscal consolidation in the U.S. would indeed help the adjustment of global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Other papers   have highlighted the role that Europe and Japan can play in the adjustment process,  in particular the fact that structural reforms are associated with lower current account positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The role of exchange rates in addressing global imbalances has also been discussed extensively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">As argued in several papers  , the effectiveness of currency appreciations or depreciations as a policy tool for addressing global imbalances needs to be carefully assessed, taking into account the impact on countries’ external positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Further research on this topic is certainly needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This conference has also contributed to the debate about whether the adjustment of global imbalances will be benign or disorderly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">As has been pointed out, recent monetary policy developments might work in favour of a benign adjustment, since the interest rate increases recorded in the United States over the last two years should contribute to cooling domestic absorption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.12,0)">Indeed, as shown by Bems, Dedola and Smets, the tightening of monetary policy has a negative effect on absorption and a significant positive effect on the trade balance in the U.S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The role of institutions Turning now to the main theme of my remarks I would like to further explore the link between institutions and international capital flows and global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This link has been identified in several conference papers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">2.1 Institutions and international capital flows Let me start with the definition of institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">According to Douglass North “Institutions are the rules of the game in a society … that shape human interaction.”   As an implication, institutions “… structure incentives in human exchange, whether political, social or economic.” I will focus my remarks mainly on domestic institutions and will thus not touch on the reform of the international financial institutions, such as the Bretton Woods ones, which is certainly an important issue but may be less directly linked to the issue of improving the allocation of global capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I will also limit myself to economic institutions, because of their primary importance for economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.92,0)">Economic institutions include the structure of property rights and the maturity of markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Broadly seen, economic institutions help to allocate resources efficiently, and determine a fair rewarding of the factors of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.72,0)">I now come to the so-called “Lucas Paradox of international capital flows”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">According to the standard neoclassical theory capital should flow from rich to poor countries until the return to investment is equalized in all countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.5,0)">In reality the opposite happens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">In what is considered now a classic example, Robert Lucas compares the U.S. and India in 1988 and shows that the marginal product of capital in India is about 58 times higher than that of the U.S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Such a large return differential should have generated a massive capital flow from the U.S. to India, which, however, did not occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Research has empirically investigated the reasons for the lack of capital flows from rich to poor countries and found that institutional quality is a key variable explaining the Lucas Paradox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">2.2 Adjustment channels Let me now discuss how the quality of institutions in emerging economies can affect global imbalances and their adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.18,0)">Some emerging economies have recorded what Ben Bernanke has called a “saving glut”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">High savings have led these economies to run huge current account surpluses and finance the large U.S. current account deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.67,0)">Current account deficits or surpluses are, per se, neither bad nor good – they may simply reflect inter-temporal consumption smoothing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">If a borrowing country uses these resources efficiently, the repayment of the debt should raise no problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">One would expect emerging economies to borrow from abroad in order to finance their investment needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In fact, we are currently observing the reverse pattern: on aggregate, capital is flowing from emerging economies to developed ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In some cases capital is flowing back to Emerging Market economies through the form of FDIs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.21,0)">Some EME, like China, actually record both a current account surplus and a capital account surplus, which is the sign of a significant domestic imbalance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The weakness of domestic institutions is at the heart of this imbalance There are several channels through which improvements in the quality of institutions can contribute to the adjustment of global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I will discuss three of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The first channel concerns property rights and their link with the development of financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Better property rights deepen financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">The access to credit is easier and more spread out in well developed financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Less binding credit constraints allow for more inter-temporal borrowing and lending, and hence better consumption smoothing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.69,0)">More developed financial systems in emerging economies would reduce precautionary saving and contribute to diminish the current account surplus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The second channel refers to the provision of government services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Either directly or indirectly, through regulations and incentives, the State should provide citizens with social security services such as health care, education and pension plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The lack of this kind of services, not only by the public, but also by the private sector, increases precautionary savings and thus increases the current account surplus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The paper by Faria, Mauro, Minnoni and Zaklan offers an illustration of how this channel works.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Institutional quality in a broad sense, including human capital, has been one of the driving forces attracting international capital over the two major waves of financial globalization – the one of the 19th century and the current one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Finally, the third channel refers to the role of institutions in reducing the risk of expropriation for investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The argument draws on recent research by René Stulz and the conference paper by Kho, Stulz and Warnock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.41,0)">If the quality of institutions is weak, investors risk expropriation by the state or by those who control firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">States should ultimately grant and protect the rights of investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Significant expropriation risks lead to highly concentrated corporate ownership which limits “… economic growth, risk-sharing, financial development, and the impact of financial globalisation.”   Reducing expropriation risks leads to less concentrated ownership, which in turn may generate more investment, domestic as well as foreign, and higher economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">This would contribute to lower external surpluses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The benefits from better institutions in emerging markets go beyond the direct contribution to the adjustment of global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.96,0)">A weak institutional environment also affects, for example, the borrowing behaviour of emerging economies, contributing to what is known as the “original sin”, whereby investors are less willing to denominate their loans in the local currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.91,0)">Similarly, investors are less willing to issue long term debt or to invest resources through other arrangements, such as foreign direct investment, that inhibit the withdrawal of funds from the market at a relatively short notice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Thus, better institutions can also make emerging markets more resilient to financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.74,0)">Improving institutions is not easy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It requires first and foremost the recognition that existing institutions are not adequate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This recognition has to be made by the insiders, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.2,0)">those that participate in or run existing institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.97,0)">Several EME seem to live in a state of denial, pointing to other critical factors, most often external, explaining financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">This is why several countries have looked for an alternative to the strengthening of institutions, consisting in accumulating large stocks of foreign reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Foreign reserve accumulation has been a   substitute for institution building, with a view to increase the country’s credibility in the eyes of foreign investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.84,0)">In contrast to institution building, however, the sizable foreign reserve accumulation has further contributed to the build-up of imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.5,0)">Such a policy has also been very costly to the economy, taking into account efficiency losses, and is not sustainable over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.12,0)">2.3 The relative quality of institutions One issue that is often forgotten is that the quality of institutions changes over time in both developed and emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As the quality of institutions improves in emerging markets, it might be improving even more in developed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">In recent years financial markets in countries such as the U.S. and some European economies have deepened more than those of emerging countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The relative advantage of advanced countries’ financial assets might, ceteris paribus, have increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.6,0)">A recent study by the International Monetary Fund   finds some evidence that in several Asian economies the quality of economic institutions has actually diverged from that of advanced countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This might explain why, in spite of some improvements, South East Asian economies have continued to experience net capital outflows over the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">2.4 Some illustrations Even if the competition in the quality of institutions toughens, in light of the improvements recorded also in the advanced economies, substantial gains can nevertheless be obtained in the absolute improvement of institutions in EME.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">For economies of South East Asia, especially China, this would contribute to reduce the savings rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Recent developments in two of the most dynamic regions of the world – South East Asia and Central and Eastern Europe – offer an interesting comparison of the effect of better institutions on the saving rate and external position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Over the last decade countries of Central and Eastern Europe have achieved significant improvements in their institutional environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">According to a study by the IMF, the quality of economic and political institutions in Central and Eastern Europe improved by more than in any other region and by some measures is now higher than in the economies of South East Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">These improvements were to a large extent achieved through the EU accession process, which provided powerful incentives for economic and political transformations, including the build-up of sound economic institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.16,0)">It is interesting to observe that economic growth in Central and Eastern Europe over the last decade has been accompanied by substantially lower aggregate savings ratios than in South East Asia  and with current account deficits rather than surplus, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">a new inflow of capital rather than a net outflow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Developments in Central and Eastern Europe appear to be more in line with the prediction of the neoclassical theory, whereby capital should flow into, rather than out, of relatively poor countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">This seems to confirm the hypothesis that the difference in net saving rates is attributed to the pace at which institutions have improved over time in the two regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The economic literature has evidenced several empirical regularities concerning cross-border capital flows and asset holdings over the last quarter of a century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">First, both flows and stocks of assets and liabilities have increased rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Second, most of the increase in cross-border flows has been among developed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.88,0)">Third, current account imbalances have increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">While the U.S. has been the biggest contributor the imbalances, many other large economies have seen their net external positions widen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.82,0)">These facts are consistent with the view that differences in the quality of institutions can explain the observed pattern of international capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.71,0)">Conclusions It is clear that the recent trend of increasing current account imbalances cannot persist indefinitely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Eventually, through market forces or with the help of coordinated adjustment policies, the current trends will have to be corrected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">For policy makers it is preferable that the adjustment is smooth and consistent with continued strong economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">To achieve this, policy makers need to take responsibility for implementing the right policy actions, including the development of well-designed institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">While the academic literature has mainly focused on differences in economic institutions as the cause of differences in economic development,  some further attention could be paid to the impact that institutions can have on capital flows and global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">This conference has certainly made a contribution in that direction.</span>
