    <h1> Financial stability risks and macroprudential policy in the euro area </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the ECB and Its Watchers XIX Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2018 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Vítor Constâncio </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)"> Financial stability risks and macroprudential policy in the euro area Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the ECB and Its Watchers XIX Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 14 March 2018 Ladies and Gentlemen, I am grateful for the opportunity to address you at the nineteenth edition of the ECB’s Watchers conference, which has become a reference point over these first two decades of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.2,0)">As interest rates across the globe have remained at very low levels for an extended period of time, supported by very accommodative monetary policies, possible related financial stability concerns came increasingly to the fore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.78,0)">In particular, the question of whether monetary policy should “lean against the wind”, countering a build-up of possible imbalances, has been debated once again, harking back to similar discussions held in academic and policy fora in various waves over the past decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">However, contrary to some critical comments on our monetary policy, financial stability in the euro area has been preserved all along.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In my remarks today I will briefly recall the academic debate and revisit the arguments that led to the understanding that macroprudential policies are best placed to address financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">I will then illustrate how the use of macroprudential policies can be welfare-improving, in particular in a monetary union where the single monetary policy is not well-suited to deal with financial imbalances that typically arise at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I will conclude with a review of the current situation in various asset markets, which, apart from some pockets of vulnerability, do not signal any credit-fuelled bubbles that would justify wide-spread policy action at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Monetary policy, “leaning against the wind” and macroprudential policies The debate on “leaning against the wind” – using monetary policy to curb financial imbalances and overvaluations in asset prices – intensified in the late nineties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The practice implies increasing policy rates pre-emptively, above what would be adequate, for attaining the goal of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The BIS composite asset price index, relating asset prices with the evolution of credit, as in Borio, Kennedy, and Prowse   raised the possibility of using monetary policy interest rates to contain credit increase and avoid overstretched asset valuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.65,0)">However, later in the decade, Bernanke and Gertler   argued forcefully that monetary policy should only respond to fluctuations in asset prices, to the extent that they affect forecasts of inflation or the output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The authors highlighted that, in normal times, convergence of price and financial stability objectives usually holds, relating financial stability to the absence of excessive movements in asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.74,0)">In their view, when targeted inflation is assured or below target, monetary policy should not become over-restrictive just to pre-empt possible asset bubbles due to two main arguments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.59,0)">First, the early identification and precise measurement of price bubbles in real time was difficult, if not outright impossible; second, even if such price misalignments were observed, it was argued, monetary policy would not be able to deal with them adequately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.83,0)">This was because the interest rate adjustments necessary to contain asset price bubbles could not be easily calibrated based on theory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.39,0)">Furthermore, the increase of rates needed to curb an asset price bubble could be significant with substantially negative impact on growth and inflation, thus compromising the mandatory goal of monetary policy and affecting its credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Contrasting this view, Cecchetti et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">and Borio et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">called for a more active role of monetary policy in addressing financial stability risks .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.88,0)">They argued that if expected inflation were to remain unaffected by an asset price bubble, which would be the case if the bubble was not too long lasting, then reacting only to expected inflation would not prevent bubble-induced macroeconomic volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.78,0)">In this first stage of the debate, the arguments hovered around a view of financial stability associated with asset price behaviour and concentrated on whether monetary policy rates, viewed as the only monetary policy instrument, should be used to serve the two objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.49,0)">The financial crisis changed the terms of the debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.09,0)">The notion of systemic risk , referring to impairments in the financial system with material consequences for the real economy, substituted the narrow concern of overvaluations in asset prices, while naturally also including them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">The second change relates to the emergence of a new policy area – macroprudential policy – with its dedicated set of policy instruments that have been intensely researched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In all major jurisdictions at least some instruments have been granted, in different degrees, to central banks and constitute a clear alternative or complement to monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This development has allowed monetary policy freedom to pursue its own purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.42,0)">At the same time, the 2008 crisis confirmed that private credit booms are responsible for most of the financial crisis as shown by Schularick and Taylor in a series of papers .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Several research papers, have however, shown that increases in interest rates may even increase rather than decrease credit and the debt-to-GDP ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.8,0)">In fact, higher interest rates also increase the debt service burden and lower the income of the borrowers, who then borrow more to smooth consumption as shown by Alpanda el al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">, Gelain et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">and Korinek and Simsek  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">This reinforces the preference for the use of macroprudential policy to deal with financial stability concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Accordingly, the main view became that two separate policy functions should be the norm, keeping the pre-crisis, price stability-oriented, monetary policy frameworks largely unaffected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Nevertheless, some alternative views go to the extreme point of advocating the full merger of monetary policy and macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.72,0)">My own view is that the two policies are different and should remain separate, as convincingly argued in Svensson   , implying that monetary policy should not respond to financial stability concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">The new main justifying argument for this stance is that macroprudential policy is now available and is the most effective tool for safeguarding financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.67,0)">This is because policy instruments directly address excessive leverage behaviour and do not have the same cost or negative spillovers of a “leaning against the wind” policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Costs and benefits of “leaning against the wind” Contributing to this debate, I want to investigate three points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">First, what are the costs and benefits of “leaning against the wind” by monetary policy in the euro area; second, how does it compare with macroprudential policy and third, how do macroprudential policy and the financial cycle interact with regards to the cost and benefits of “leaning against the wind”?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The analysis is based on a simple theoretical framework brought forward by Svensson  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The model includes a flexible inflation-targeting central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">The cost of “leaning against the wind” is measured by the increase in unemployment following a monetary policy pre-emptive tightening, and benefits are related to a lower probability and severity of financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The empirical results are based on a monetary policy shock in a calibrated DSGE model for Sweden and several empirical studies that help to calibrate some of the effects considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.74,0)">Svensson argues, that “leaning against the wind” not only has a cost in terms of a weaker economy if no crisis occurs but, in addition, the costs of a potential crisis would be even more substantial if such a policy was used, by means of a second round of unemployment cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.6,0)">Contrary to all previous studies, it takes into account that the severity of a crisis depends on the situation prevailing before the crisis eclodes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In turn, this is dependent on the effects of the pre-emptive increase in interest rates, above what was necessary to control inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The empirical analysis of Svensson concludes that the marginal costs of using monetary policy to “lean against the wind” by far exceed the benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">In other words, the cost of higher unemployment as a result of the monetary policy tightening far outweighs the benefits of the reduced probability and severity of financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.46,0)">Svensson’s conclusions have been criticised by Adrian and Liang   and by several BIS researchers for not properly accounting for systemic risks and the persistence of the financial cycle, which risks ignoring the long-lasting effects on the real economy that financial crises may have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Accounting for these elements, it is argued, would create a case for a more active use of monetary policy to lean against the financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Svensson   has responded forcefully to these criticisms and to shed further light on this debate, two of our researchers have recalibrated Svensson’s model for the euro area using a DSGE model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.6,0)">Figure 1 shows that the direct recalibration comes to the same conclusion for the euro area as Svensson’s result does for Sweden; namely, that a monetary policy that tries to “lean against the wind” is associated with substantial net marginal costs  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.28,0)">The result also holds when the key financial variable in Svensson’s model   is replaced by a more broad-based and persistent financial cycle variable along the lines argued by some of Svensson’s critics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In order to establish the link between the financial cycle and the probability of the start of a crisis, a composite indicator for cyclical systemic risk is included and its value overtime is an outcome of the DSGE model used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Considering now macroprudential policies, for illustrative purposes, we introduced a macroprudential policy measure of a 1 pp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">increase of the capital buffer requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">When modifying the model in this way, we observe   that this measure is more effective in reducing the probability and severity of financial crises   and that the negative impact on unemployment   is somewhat lower, than a monetary policy that tries to “lean against the wind”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Overall, the marginal benefits of macroprudential policy outweigh the marginal costs; especially also in the case where the financial cycle   is taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.29,0)">In the euro area context, the relative effectiveness of macroprudential policy to tackle the build-up of financial stability risks is even more pronounced owing to the fact that, in a monetary union, a single monetary policy is not well-suited to deal with financial imbalances emerging at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Such imbalances are indeed better tackled with targeted national macroprudential measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">To illustrate this point, we consider a situation of a country-specific gradual rise of 10% in house prices over a two-year horizon, fuelled by strong demand and loose credit conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">For simulation purposes, we used a two-country DSGE model calibrated to euro area countries with a single monetary policy and the possibility to conduct country-specific macroprudential policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The baseline simulation assumes that monetary and macroprudential policies are unchanged for two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Against this background, two policy responses to mitigate the housing market imbalances are contrasted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In the first scenario, we assume that a cap on loan-to-value ratios   is introduced in the booming region, while monetary policy is kept constant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In the second scenario, the monetary policy rate is raised in the spirit of “leaning against the wind”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The respective simulations are presented in Figure It turns out that the macroprudential measure is able to contain the asset price increase in the booming region   and to better shield the rest of the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.24,0)">By comparison, a tightening of monetary policy delivers significantly more cross-country heterogeneity and negative cross-border spillovers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">To sum up, there are synergies and trade-offs between monetary and macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.84,0)">These interactions may become even more pronounced in a monetary union where monetary policy, by definition, will be focusing on area-wide economic and financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In such circumstances, macroprudential policy targeting imbalances building up at the national level within the monetary union can help to achieve better policy outcomes in terms of price and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Safeguarding financial stability in the euro area Let me now turn to our actual experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Our price stability mandate continues to require maintaining a very accommodative monetary policy stance which has been decisive for the economic recovery and gradual normalisation of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Naturally, the resulting low interest environment in the euro area, similarly to all major jurisdictions, continues to generate a search for yield by market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.05,0)">Nevertheless, contrary to some alarmist views, euro area asset prices currently do not point to signs of a general overvaluation in the euro area and certainly not of credit-fuelled bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.99,0)">There are, of course, specific market segments that require close monitoring and there is margin for contagion if a significant financial price correction occurs worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me go through the major asset classes in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Euro area stock prices have been on an overall upward path but generally do not appear to be exceptionally elevated by historical standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In particular, the cyclically adjusted price/earnings ratio remains moderate, in contrast to developments in the U.S.  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.01,0)">However, developments in the U.S. are not irrelevant for the euro area: as seen in February, a sudden correction could, to some extent, spill over to euro area markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">More broadly, the sharp movements that took place in the U.S. equity market in February 2018 demonstrated how sentiment can change very quickly – and market participants should be well aware of this risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.68,0)">In an environment characterised by search for yield and depressed volatility, technical factors can greatly amplify initial market movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This reflects the fact the volatility itself has become an asset class on which investors take positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">However, following the peak reached during the correction at the beginning of February 2018, markets now expect a somewhat higher volatility in stock prices, up from the record-low levels seen during the past year  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.35,0)">Turning to fixed income markets, euro area sovereign bond yields are hovering at very low levels and have stayed well-anchored throughout the recent repricing episode.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.65,0)">Spreads across euro area sovereigns have remained narrow  , reflecting the significant fiscal consolidation and structural reform efforts made in the aftermath of the sovereign crisis and the significantly improved macroeconomic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">While the ECB’s expansionary monetary policy has also undoubtedly supported bond prices, judging from forward rates, market participants expect a smooth adjustment in global monetary policy rates without much turbulence  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Nevertheless, term premia remain low and in fact still negative in the U.S. A possible normalisation of term premia towards historical averages would point to some scope for adjustment in bond yields  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.25,0)">Corporate credit spreads have also remained at low levels in the euro area and yield compression has been particularly impressive for the riskiest, high-yield segments  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.08,0)">This has resulted in lower investor compensation than has historically been the case for the level of default risk embedded in the bonds, in other words, negative excess bond premia  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">This very sanguine pricing of corporate bonds is based on expectations of continued comfortable debt servicing burdens and vigorous earnings growth, what is sometimes called “pricing for perfection”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.0,0)">But this delicate investor sentiment can be quickly swayed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.91,0)">Furthermore, we have recently observed that in some high-yield markets, such as leveraged loans, the spread compression has sometimes been accompanied by higher borrower leverage and contracts with lower investor protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.55,0)">Should this become more wide-spread, it could fuel vulnerabilities to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">These developments, therefore, warrant close monitoring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Finally, turning to real estate markets, our analysis suggests that, at the aggregate level, residential property prices may – at most – be somewhat more elevated than what would be justified by fundamentals  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Going into detail, we do see signs of overvaluation in certain areas and large cities, where housing prices have increased at a faster pace than household incomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The hunt for yield has also contributed to continued increases in the prices of prime commercial properties, which have already reached historical highs in many euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.14,0)">Indeed, there are indications that values may be stretched in this segment and investors need to be aware of the associated risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Although potentially of concern for individual investors, we should place this market into perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.72,0)">Whereas residential mortgages constitute around 16% of the assets of euro area banks on average, the corresponding figure for commercial property loans is 7%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.31,0)">Moreover, prime commercial property constitutes only a sub-segment of this market and, consequently, is relatively small in size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.96,0)">Therefore, we currently do not see systemic consequences arising from the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">To sum up, apart from the few pockets of vulnerability I mentioned, the overall financial stability picture in the euro area reveals no signs of generalised asset market bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Moreover, the crucial factor of private sector leverage fuelled by bank credit, does not seem to have markedly contributed to vulnerabilities, as asset price increases have not been accompanied by excessive credit growth overall .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The cross-country and cross-sector heterogeneity of localised vulnerabilities underlines the advantage of macroprudential policy in containing financial stability risks, namely, the possibility to activate policy instruments in a targeted manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">National authorities in overall nine countries have decided the introduce Loan-To-Value   and Debt-To-Income   type of measures  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">These measures influence the provision of credit and raise resilience by curtailing the tails in the risk exposure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Given their effectiveness, the ECB Governing Council called upon governments in all euro area countries to implement the legislative basis for borrower-based measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">In addition to the borrower-based measures, some authorities have raised risk weights for exposures to the real estate sector to increase bank resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">To further enhance resilience and to address potential cyclical systemic risks, Slovakia has activated the countercyclical buffer and Lithuania has announced the intention to do the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Finally, as regards capital buffers to counter the “too-big-to-fail” problem, the decisions relate to eight globally important banks   and more than one hundred domestic systemically important financial institutions in all euro area countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.71,0)">The capital- and borrower-based macroprudential instruments I just mentioned are targeting risks among the banking sector and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But given that the growing fraction of credit intermediation is conducted by non-bank financial institutions, they do not necessarily reach beyond the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Europe should thus expand the toolkit to cover maturity mismatch and leverage also in the non-banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The ongoing review of the macroprudential framework in the EU provides an excellent opportunity to make these necessary tools available to macroprudential authorities on a common legal basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The secure financial stability environment has been fostered by a host of macroproprudential measures adopted by member states and not objected by the ECB that, as you know, has the competence to top up national measures and analyse their spillovers to neighbouring countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The institutional setup in the euro area, with distinct roles assigned to monetary policy for the maintenance of price stability and to macroprudential policy for safeguarding financial stability, is well placed to achieve both of these objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">In my remarks, I have shown that this is supported by the academic consensus and empirical evidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In a monetary union with a single monetary policy, this set-up allows deploying targeted macroprudential policies wherever imbalances may be emerging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.41,0)">In general, in view of the present international situation that may trigger financial market turbulence with contagion for the euro area, there is no margin for complacency and inaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In this perspective, the European legal macroprudential policy framework needs to be enhanced by introducing new instruments, including for non-banks, and by allowing Member States and the ECB more flexibility to activate those instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Apparently the forthcoming review of the CRD IV/CRR will not deliver the comprehensive reform of the macroprudential framework which would be important in order to continue safeguarding financial stability in the euro area.</span>
