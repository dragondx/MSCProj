    <h3> Speaker: Jörg Asmussen </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)"> Building Banking Union Speech by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Atlantic Council,London, 9 July 2013 Ladies and gentlemen, Let me thank the Atlantic Council for inviting me here to speak today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This event is part of the Atlantic Council’s Transatlantic Finance Initiative, and in recent weeks we have been reminded again just how important the transatlantic relationship is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">We have seen how policy decisions in the United States can have immediate impact on markets here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Similarly, when I speak to American colleagues I often hear how the euro area’s reaction to the on-going crisis is seen as key risk factor for the outlook there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">To emphasise this interconnection, just yester-day negotiations started on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which is expected to give an annual boost to the EU and US economies of around 120 billion euro and 95 billion euro, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">This underscores why strengthening dialogue through events such as these is important, to better understand how and why policy decisions in the US and the euro area are being made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">And in that context, I would like to use my intervention today to discuss a key issue for the euro area that also has a strong transatlantic dimension: Banking Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But before I turn to this, let me briefly say a word about the UK.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I understand that there is in-tense debate going on at the moment about the UK’s place in the EU, and a lot of questions are being asked about the value of continued membership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">But I firmly believe that the best place for this country is to be at the heart of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">That is where it can have most influence on the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">And that is where the EU can benefit most from its contribution, not least in transatlantic relations where the UK traditionally has a special link to the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">I therefore hope that, when the current debates are resolved, the UK returns to that position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">That said, it is clear now that the euro area will move faster than others in terms of economic and political integration: there will be a Europe of different speeds, with the euro area as its engine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.08,0)">But this need not be a threat to the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The key is to ensure that integration remains open to all: the Fiscal Compact, where 25 out of then 27 countries chose to join, and the SSM, which is open to non-euro area countries, show how this can be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Moreover, as we have seen today in the case of Latvia, the euro area is still attractive to new members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">And for the time being, this trend should be helpful for this country: it will allow the UK to find a place in the EU that suits it, without holding back others that want to go further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Supervision Let me start by reviewing the state of play of the key elements of Banking Union, beginning with the Single Supervisory Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As you know, the SSM Regulation is still being discussed by the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.84,0)">The Parliament has scheduled a vote on the Regulation for its plenary session on 9-12 September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.03,0)">If this vote passes, the text would then have to be agreed with the Council and enter into the official journal, which could take a few weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This means that we can tentatively conclude that the ECB will take over supervision in September or October 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Following the approval of the Regulation, the members of the Supervisory Board can be ap-pointed and we will start the general recruitment of staff for the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This is key to get the SSM moving, as a number of major decisions can only be taken when the Supervisory Board is in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.79,0)">That said, this has not prevented us from progressing with the preparatory work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Technical preparations have been on-going since September 2012, involving officials from the ECB and the national supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Some of the key issues we are working on are as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">First, a full mapping of the euro area banking system, so we can identify which are the significant and less significant banks – that is, those which will and will not be directly supervised by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Our current estimate is that we will directly supervise around 130 banking groups operating in the euro area which covers approximately 85% of euro area bank assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Second, we are developing a common supervisory model, which lays down how the different layers of SSM – national supervisors and the ECB – will work together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The aim is to create, for each banking group we supervise, a joint supervisory team that vertically integrates supervisors in Frankfurt with those in the national competent authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">As part of this work we are also developing a supervisory manual which will create a unified supervisory approach across all SSM jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This will apply to issues like off-site and on-site reviews, risk assessments and model validations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is worth noting that the task we are undertaking here is comparable to the challenge of set-ting up the ECB and European System of Central Banks in the late 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">One difference is that central bankers in Europe had been cooperating for decades, not least to maintain the various European exchange rate regimes, and met frequently in the Committee of Governors in Basel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This meant that there was already a largely homogenous culture on which we could build.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In the supervisory field, however, cooperation has historically been looser, and as a result there are several different supervisory traditions and philosophies that we need to unite into a single system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In other words, we are working together to create a single supervisory culture and find our leitmotif, but it will take time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Third, we are preparing to conduct a comprehensive assessment of all banks that will come under direct ECB supervision, which is required by the SSM Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The assessment will involve a Balance Sheet Assessment  , including an Asset Quality Review, to be conducted by the ECB together with the national supervisors and assisted by external expertise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This will then feed into the overall stress test to be conducted by EBA, in cooperation with the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Technical work on the design of the BSA is al-ready underway, and it will accelerate through-out the summer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">While the methodology and timing of the assessment can only be finally established when the Supervisory Board is in place, we currently expect the whole exercise to start in Q1 of next year and to be completed be-fore the SSM takes over supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We want this exercise to be rigorous to restore confidence in the European banking sector after two previous stress tests failed to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.42,0)">This means that it may reveal capital shortfalls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is therefore essential for market confidence that supervisors and governments make clear ex ante how such shortfalls would be dealt with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">I am pleased that the recent European Council has acknowledged this issue and called for backstops to be in place before the assessment is completed – otherwise we would not be in a position to undertake it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The first backstop for any capital needs will of course be the market, and for the time being national budgets and the existing ESM facilities will form the second and third line of defence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Direct bank recapitalisation via the ESM – with the exception of very rare and unlikely cases – will only be available once the SSM is fully operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">A further issue we are working on is the accountability arrangements with the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We place a high priority on this, because supervision may directly affect citizens’ and companies’ property rights and therefore has to be given full democratic legitimisation at the right level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">We believe that level is the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">We expect the discussions to be finalised soon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">I mentioned above the EBA, and some of you may be wondering what the creation of the SSM will mean for this authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">In my view, the SSM will in fact be very positive for the EBA, for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">First, the EBA will remain responsible for developing regulatory policy and technical standards that will form the basis of a single rulebook for banks across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The creation of the SSM should help this pro-cess, as having a significant number of countries participating in the SSM will reduce the scope for coordination failures, thus making the EBA’s coordination function easier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At the same time, the interests of non-SSM members will be protected by double-majority voting: for a vote to pass, there will have to be a majority by voting weight of all EU members, plus a simple unweighted majority of the euro-zone "outs" and the "ins".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Second, the EBA is currently developing a supervisory handbook which reflects best supervisory practices across the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">The ECB is cooperating closely with the EBA to ensure that its own supervisory manual and the EBA handbook are fully consistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Here again, the existence of the SSM should help the EBA’s work, as all SSM members will naturally converge in their supervisory practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Resolution Let me now turn to the other key element of Banking Union, which is a Single Resolution Mechanism operating under a single legal framework for resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Looking at the US financial sector shows the value of a strong and clear resolution regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.77,0)">The FDIC has resolved around 480 smaller banks since the start of the crisis, and it is probably no coincidence that there a few concerns there about “zombie banks”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Dodd-Frank has created a similar resolution framework for larger banks, strengthening market discipline and reducing distorted incentives linked to “too big to fail”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.2,0)">This is what we should be aiming for in Europe: we cannot afford to have a regime that is too weak or too complicated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The process of building a stronger resolution framework has now begun with the recent agreement by the ECOFIN Council on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive  , which now needs to be agreed with the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Overall, I welcome the Council general approach and hope that the Trialogue process with European Parliament can be completed swiftly after the summer break.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">But let me single out two issues that I find positive in the agreement, and two which I believe could still be improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Starting with the positives, it is important that we have now established the principles that bail-out is out, and bail-in is in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Under the Council approach, banks can only be recapitalised with resolution financing arrangements – such as a resolution fund – after a minimum level of bail-in equal to 8% of the total li-abilities including own funds, has been imposed on shareholders and creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">While this of course does not mean that taxpayers will never again be on the line, it should give them more protection, and sharpen incentives to exercise discipline in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The second positive is that Council approach on BRRD contains a depositor preference rule which puts some types of deposits at the end of the resolution pecking order and exempts insured deposits from bail-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Depositor preference is important to give the same reassurance to depositors in all parts of the euro area, especially smaller depositors like ordinary citizens and micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, who will be given preference over depositors from large corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Moreover, it helps reduce financial fragmentation based on varying credibility of national de-posit guarantee schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As deposit guarantee schemes will be given highest priority in resolution, they should only have to pay out in extreme cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">This means that the existing arrangements backstopped by individual countries should be sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The two issues which I believe could be improved are as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.14,0)">First, the entry into force of the bail-in tool un-der the Council approach would be 1 January 2019 at the latest, and in my view, this is too late.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.35,0)">It means that there is a time gap where a harmonised resolution framework has entered into force but one of the key resolution tools is not available to national resolution authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.66,0)">In the interim, not having access to this tool may impact the timely and orderly resolution of an institution or result in possible ad hoc national solutions which should be avoided in a Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The European Parliament proposal for bail-in to enter into force in 2016 is an improvement, but January 2015 would be better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Markets will in any case anticipate bail-in earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Second, the arrangements for bail-in could be more rules-based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The ECB has always argued for discretionary exclusions from bail-in to be limited so as to make the rules of the game clear for global investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The Council approach gives the resolution authority powers to discretionarily exclude any type of liability for reasons of impossibility within a certain time frame, or to avoid wide-spread contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In our view, there would have been a benefit in defining ex ante the categories of liabilities that could have been excluded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.89,0)">This means that investors will lack certainty about how the new framework will be used, and in my view it may slow down the process of reducing financial fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For instance, there will inevitably be a political economy dimension to how national resolution authorities decide to exercise their discretion, with creditor classes that have particular importance in different national contexts likely to be favoured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.15,0)">This will affect the level-playing field between Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Moreover, the BRRD foresees that after 8% of a bank’s liabilities have been bailed-in, the national resolution authority has the option to use its resolution fund to bail-out a further 5% of the bank’s liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">However, some countries will have larger resolution funds than others, for instance if they have more banks paying into the fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">This means that these countries would be able to bail-out more domestic banks before they exhaust the fund than those with less resolution resources available, who would need to use more bail-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This will also not help reduce fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">The Single Resolution Mechanism   – comprising of a European resolution authority and a single resolution fund – could remedy both these fragmentation problems of the BRRD, which is a further reason why it is so essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">First, a central authority would not be influenced by national preferences when applying discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Second, a single resolution fund, financed by levies on the whole banking sector and with a European backstop, would be effectively de-linked from national budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">However, these benefits will of course only apply to countries that join the SSM and SRM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Moreover, it is essential that the European resolution authority will be in a position to act swiftly – if needed over a weekend for example – in order to avoid uncertainty about its course of action with a specific bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">As you know, we await the release of the Com-mission’s proposal on the SRM which is expected tomorrow, and I expect it goes in this direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As to its institutional structure, the first-best option would be to entrust a newly established agency with full decision-making powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">If this is not feasible in the short run, a second-best option would be to use the ESM for this purpose for an interim period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Conclusion Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.57,0)">There is no doubt that the banking system in the euro area is suffering from a confidence problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.78,0)">Investors remain unsure about the health of banks’ balance sheets; about the rigour of their supervision; and about the capacity of fiscally-constrained countries to resolve banks that are no longer viable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">This is why advancing with Banking Union is such an urgent priority for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">It is essential to build trust in the banking sector; to increase transparency over asset quality; and to ensure that banks that need to be wound down, can and will be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">From the perspective of the ECB, it is also indispensable to reintegrate financial markets and so to restore the even transmission of our monetary policy across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The progress made so far has been impressive, by any measure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The SSM is a milestone in European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But this is no time to rest on our laurels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.61,0)">We cannot afford a half-baked Banking Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">So I hope that, as of tomorrow, policy makers will now take up with urgency the task of building a strong SRM.</span>
