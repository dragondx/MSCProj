    <span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)"> Working together for growth in Europe Introductory remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,at Deutscher Bundestag, Berlin, 28 September 2016 Introduction Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of the Bundestag, Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for your invitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It is a pleasure to speak here in in the halls of the Committee on the Affairs of the European Union, where you bring the debate about European integration to the Bundestag, the heart of German democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">As President of the ECB, I am here today to explain our policies and discuss with you how the ECB is acting to fulfil the mandate that was democratically conferred upon us by the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.25,0)">As members of the Bundestag, you know what the concerns of the German people are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">I look forward to hearing about these concerns and addressing them today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.45,0)">When I came to the Bundestag four years ago, we were at the height of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Today, the euro area is in better shape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">To protect price stability, the ECB used its instruments in a manner it had not done before and developed new tools – all within our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">We reduced our interest rates to very low levels, provided targeted financing to support banks’ lending to firms and households, and started a large-scale asset purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In my introductory remarks I want to make three points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">First, I want to explain why we are pursuing our policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">I want to show how our monetary policy has maintained price stability and countered the threat of a new “Great Depression”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Our measures are working: they are contributing to keeping the recovery on track, thus creating jobs and ensuring a recovery that ultimately also benefits savers and pensioners in Germany and the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.83,0)">But I do understand that people have concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We take these concerns seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I will therefore discuss in more detail – and this is my second point – how our measures affect people’s finances and welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.9,0)">As with any monetary policy decision, our measures have distributional effects on citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.42,0)">But, on balance, savers, employees, entrepreneurs, pensioners and taxpayers across the euro area, including in Germany, are better off because of our actions – today and tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Finally, I will talk about what else is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The ECB does not operate in a vacuum: other economic policies are essential to complement our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Without them there will be no strong and sustainable recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">These other policies are a precondition for interest rates to rise again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The ECB’s actions have safeguarded price stability Let me start with the reasons for our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.53,0)">The ECB acted because inflation drifted away from our aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The EU Treaties gave the ECB the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This objective binds me and my colleagues in the ECB Governing Council, where our decisions are the result of collegial debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.1,0)">We are held accountable for these decisions in the European Parliament, where I attend four regular hearings per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.88,0)">Furthermore, our decisions are subject to judicial review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is what I mean when I say: with our measures, we follow the law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.75,0)">Sometimes people wonder whether price stability doesn’t mean inflation of 0%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.34,0)">It does not, because both inflation that is too high and inflation that is too low for too long can damage the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">A steady, measured rate of inflation below, but close to, 2% in the medium term acts like a cushion that protects our economies from drifting into the dangerous territory of negative inflation even when there is just a minor economic shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.48,0)">Once expectations of falling prices become ingrained, consumers postpone purchases in anticipation of even lower prices, while firms hold off making investments because they do not know whether they will pay off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.89,0)">This downward spiral continues until the economy collapses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">There are therefore very good reasons why central banks are so careful to avoid inflation that is either too high or too low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">You would rightly expect us to act if inflation is significantly above our objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We also need to act when inflation is close to 0%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">How do we achieve our price stability objective?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.57,0)">When inflation is too high, central banks raise interest rates to break the upward trend; when inflation is too low, they lower interest rates to achieve the opposite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Lower interest rates ease overall financing conditions in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">This in turn stimulates investment and consumption, which then induces inflation to pick up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.78,0)">But when lowering interest rates alone may not be sufficient to return to inflation rates that are in line with price stability, central banks may need to use other instruments to ease monetary and financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This is why we launched other measures, such as our asset purchase programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And we are by no means unique in this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Around the globe, central banks of the major advanced economies like the US, the UK and Japan have all embarked on large-scale sovereign bond purchase programmes to fulfil their mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Our measures have delivered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">We estimate that they will raise the inflation rate by more than half a percentage point, on average, over 2016 and 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">They will also contribute to increasing real euro area GDP growth by more than one and a half percentage points cumulatively between 2015 and 2018, which will support job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.61,0)">The effects of our policies Low rates are a symptom of the underlying economic situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.98,0)">They reflect weak long-term growth trends and the protracted macroeconomic slump that has resulted from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">And the ECB’s monetary policy has provided significant accommodation to limit the negative effects of the global and euro area-specific shocks on the economy, thereby mitigating their disinflationary impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But very low rates are not innocuous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.76,0)">They affect people’s finances and welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me start with the effects of our policies on savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.92,0)">Yes, the current low interest rate environment reduces the nominal return on saving accounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.06,0)">But what counts for savers is not the nominal interest rate but the real interest rate, which is the nominal interest rate minus inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.81,0)">Real rates are also low, but there have been many episodes of low, or even negative real interest rates in Germany well before the introduction of the euro, as a recent Bundesbank study has shown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Moreover, savers can on average still earn satisfactory rates of return from diversifying their assets, even when interest rates on deposit and savings accounts are very low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This has also been the case in Germany according to another recent Bundesbank study.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">But most importantly, whatever financial assets savers hold, they will benefit from a recovery of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">So the interest of all of us, including German savers, is the highest possible sustainable growth in Germany and the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Through our efforts to bring inflation back towards 2%, we have contributed to higher growth and the creation of more jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.72,0)">In Germany, exports are benefitting from the recovery in the euro area, unemployment is at its lowest level since reunification, people’s take-home pay is increasing noticeably, and venture capital is pouring into Berlin’s silicon alley.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.88,0)">We should also not forget that people in your constituencies are affected in different ways by our measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.87,0)">They are affected as savers, borrowers or taxpayers, and in many cases as all three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.95,0)">What a household may lose in terms of little interest on their bank account, it might save in lower mortgage payments for their home.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">And it might benefit from rising bond and stock prices in their retirement fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.59,0)">In fact, evidence shows that between 2008 and 2015 interest payments by households in Germany, as a percentage of gross disposable income, fell more sharply than interest earnings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">And the low financing costs for government bonds help to balance the budget and reduce debt at a considerable speed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">This is good news for the Finance Ministry - and thus for taxpayers - which saved in 2015 alone approximately EUR 28 billion on lower than expected interest payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We should also consider the full effect of low interest rates on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.99,0)">Those who blame ECB policy for the mixed performance of certain German financial firms have been very vocal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">But what has been forgotten is that many banks have been able to more than offset declining interest revenues with higher lending volumes, improved loan performance and lower interest expenses, all of which are beneficial to both the banks and their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.62,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy is not the main factor for the low profitability of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">While some banks’ business models may indeed need to adapt to the current low interest rate environment, they also need to address their own structural issues, such as overcapacity, the stock of non-performing loans and the potential impact of technological innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.51,0)">Low profitability is closely linked to low operational efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In Germany cost to income ratios are on average relatively high compared to other jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let us be clear, however, there is no one size fits all banking model and we have different types of banks that are successfully operating in Germany and in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.27,0)">Of course, low interest rates for a long period might carry the risk of overvaluation in asset markets as a result of the search for yield.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This is why we closely monitor potential risks to financial stability that might emanate for instance from local real estate markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.26,0)">But at the moment we are not seeing any overheating in the euro area or the German economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">While we do observe a somewhat stronger increase in residential real estate prices, notably in large cities in Germany, such increases are not the reflection of a bubble, as lending is growing only moderately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.93,0)">Moreover, overall household debt-to-income levels are comparatively low and stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Where signs of excessive risk-taking emerge, macroprudential measures at the national level should be the instrument of choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">They allow exuberant financial developments to be addressed in a more targeted way, while monetary policy contributes to the stability of the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">So far I have discussed the reasons for our measures and their effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">To summarise, our policies allow the recovery to take hold so that we will be able to raise interest rates again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">After all, the interest earnings that the savers understandably crave need to be generated first in the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In a stagnant economy there is little to be shared out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It should also be noted that the level to which real interest rates can eventually return when the economy strengthens is not determined by monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Instead, it depends on the economy’s long-term growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.71,0)">Productivity and demographics play a decisive role in this, and the development of these factors has not been favourable in Europe in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is a phenomenon we also see in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">For long-term interest rates to rise in the future we therefore need more investment and structural reforms to lift growth and productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">As Wolfgang Schäuble said in this house a couple of weeks ago when he presented the budget for 2017: we will only get out of this phase of low interest rates if we have more sustainable growth in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">The need for decisive action at the national and European level This leads me to my final point: policy-makers across the euro area, need to seize the opportunity to deliver reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">At the height of the crisis, all Member States and citizens showed an enormous commitment to keeping the euro area together when the critics were already talking about the euro’s demise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">But we cannot stop here: we need to make sure not only that the euro survives, but that our Economic and Monetary Union thrives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">If we want to succeed, we will need to find common solutions for the problems that we all face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">If we want to preserve the European social model, we will need to bring labour and product markets in line with the realities of the digital and globalised world of the 21st century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">If we want savers to benefit from higher interest rates in the future, we will need to create investment opportunities to put these savings to a productive use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This is about raising productivity and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This is about structural reforms that are a necessary complement to our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And Member States have to do their part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I have highlighted this many times in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In fact, I emphasise it every six weeks at the ECB’s press conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And where we face common supranational challenges, and currently there are several such challenges, there is no alternative to acting jointly as Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Consider the transformative power of the deepening of the Single Market at the end of the 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This opened up new opportunities and it continues to benefit European companies and individuals alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Consider what can still be achieved with the Digital Single Market, the energy union and the capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.07,0)">Without a well-functioning Single Market, our firms would lose access to a market of 500 million consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Without a Single Market, we Europeans would have little global leverage to uphold our values, such as our respect for the right to privacy on the internet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Together we are immeasurably stronger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">The ECB is vigorously counteracting risks to price stability using all necessary tools within its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Our monetary policy has supported growth and employment and will eventually bring inflation back to our aim of below, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Low interest rates today are necessary for a return to higher interest rates in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">What we need now is to allow our measures to develop their full impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">And in order to reap the full benefits of our monetary policy measures, other policy areas must contribute much more decisively, both at the national and at the European level.</span>
