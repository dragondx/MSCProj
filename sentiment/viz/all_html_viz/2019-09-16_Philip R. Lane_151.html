    <h1> Reflections on monetary policy </h1>
    <h2> Keynote speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at Bloomberg, London, 16 September 2019 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Philip R. Lane </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.51,0)"> Reflections on monetary policy Keynote speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at Bloomberg, London, 16 September 2019 I will divide this speech into two parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">First, I wish to review the current economic and financial environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Second, I will discuss the monetary policy decisions taken by the Governing Council in last week’s meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.34,0)">The euro area economy Incoming information is signalling a more extended slowdown in euro area growth dynamics than previously expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.98,0)">As I will discuss, this slowdown is mainly due to external developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.85,0)">While domestic demand is resilient, persistent uncertainties related to protectionist policies and geopolitical factors are taking a toll on economic sentiment and are clearly weighing on the euro area manufacturing sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.65,0)">On the international front, the latest survey data indicate that global activity remains subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This is the case in both emerging market and advanced economies, which suggests that a common factor is at play  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.13,0)">The manufacturing sector has been affected most strongly, in particular for capital and intermediate goods, as well as for durable consumption goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.0,0)">Since these goods are highly tradable, their production is sensitive to developments in international trade, which continues to be weak  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.18,0)">Global trade and, consequently, euro area foreign demand have slowed substantially in recent quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">2 for advanced economies excluding the euro area and 53.1 for emerging market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.12,0)">Long-run average refers to the period from 1999 onwards for euro area and advanced economies and 2005 onwards for emerging market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.65,0)">Latest observation: July 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.99,0)">One obvious source of weak trade dynamics is the uncertainty surrounding the international trading system, due to the rise of protectionism and geopolitical factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.31,0)">Although the direct effects of individual tariff measures on economic activity have been contained, prolonged uncertainty and the prospect of an escalation of trade disputes are indirectly affecting the world economy by weighing on economic sentiment and global investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.97,0)">Not only are protectionist measures a near-term headwind for the world economy, they can also give rise to allocative distortions that affect the level of potential output and the potential rate of productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.23,0)">While these trade tensions are prominent, we should not ignore the fact that other factors are also affecting the manufacturing sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Some emerging economies   are rebalancing away from export-orientated manufacturing towards domestically-orientated services sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.97,0)">In addition, following an exceptionally strong performance in 2017, the global technology sector has started to cool  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Several key Asian economies specialise in tech production, with Asian tech exports accounting for 10 percent of global trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.94,0)">These economies are closely linked to one another through integrated supply chains, such that the slowdown in tech production has affected economic activity in a number of countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.11,0)">Latest update: August 2019   and July 2019  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.59,0)">Turning to the euro area, real GDP growth slowed from 0.4 percent, quarter on quarter, in the first quarter of this year, to 0.2 percent in the second quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.15,0)">This slowdown was due to a contraction of net exports, reflecting the weakness in the external environment, while domestic demand remained resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Consumption is robust and households continue to signal optimism about their future financial situation  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">We expect positive consumption dynamics to continue to be supported by easy financing conditions, improving household balance sheets, higher disposable income on the back of fiscal stimulus, further - albeit slowing - employment gains, and rising labour income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The strength of employment growth has been a central feature of the euro area recovery in recent years and, so far, the labour market has been relatively resilient to the current slowdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Employment is still increasing: the number of people employed has risen by 11.2 million since the employment trough in mid-2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.33,0)">The unemployment rate stands at 7.5 percent, its lowest level since July 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Despite some moderation, surveys such as the purchasing managers’ index   continue to signal positive overall employment growth in the third quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">For the construction and services sectors, the PMI employment indices remain above their long-run averages, pointing to labour market resilience in sectors less exposed to trade tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.73,0)">However, in the more externally-oriented manufacturing sector, employment indicators have been in contractionary territory for four months, illustrating that the euro area labour market is not immune to global developments  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.45,0)">The continued threat of protectionism and other geopolitical risks, such as the possibility of a disorderly Brexit, are clearly weighing on confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.29,0)">Business investment has been slowing down since early 2018 and was relatively subdued in the first half of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.99,0)">The negative effects of persistent uncertainties on the euro area economy are especially evident in the manufacturing sector, which is most exposed to trade developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me elaborate on the contrast between developments in the manufacturing and services sectors, which is evident in activity, confidence, employment and price data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.24,0)">The manufacturing sector has been underperforming the more domestically oriented services sector since 2018  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.51,0)">The PMI manufacturing output index has been in contractionary territory for seven consecutive months, decreasing to 47.4 in the first two months of the third quarter, compared with an average of 48.5 in the second quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">By contrast, the services PMI remains in expansionary territory and has edged higher, on average, in the third quarter to date, when compared with the previous quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">So the gap between weak manufacturing and resilient services activity has further widened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.69,0)">While the services sector contributes over 70 percent of total value added in the euro area, the extended weakness in manufacturing is weighing considerably on overall activity levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.11,0)">In addition to its adverse impact at the aggregate level, the slowdown in manufacturing has an asymmetric effect across member countries and different sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">For example, while Germany accounts for 28 percent of euro area GDP, its contribution to euro area manufacturing value added stands at 39 percent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.91,0)">By contrast, France represents 21 percent of euro area GDP but only 13 percent of manufacturing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.65,0)">Comparing national business climate indicators shows a relatively pronounced deterioration of sentiment in Germany, where the Ifo index for manufacturing has fallen to its lowest level since December 2009  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.72,0)">Although the euro area services sector remains resilient, there is no room for complacency: the longer the weakness in manufacturing persists, the greater the risk of adverse spillovers to other sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.51,0)">In Germany, for example, service providers reported in August noticeably less optimistic expectations for the near future, and have become more pessimistic in their assessment of the current business situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.18,0)">Possible knock-on effects from anaemic industrial activity to other sectors of the economy therefore need to be closely monitored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.96,0)">As a result of continued global uncertainties and their impact on confidence, the short-term growth outlook has been revised down in the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Real GDP growth is now projected to be 1.1 percent in 2019, 1.2 percent in 2020 and 1.4 percent in 2021.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.75,0)">Compared with the June Eurosystem staff projections, growth for this year was revised down by 0.1 percentage points, and for next year by 0.2 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.99,0)">Notwithstanding the downward revisions to the growth outlook, the balance of risks remains tilted to the downside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Furthermore, I would characterise the distribution of risks as bimodal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">In one scenario, global trade tensions and Brexit could be resolved positively, while in another scenario, trade-related uncertainty could linger and risks associated with a disorderly Brexit could materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.99,0)">Latest observation: August 2019  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.17,0)">Turning to nominal developments, inflation continues to fall short of expectations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.33,0)">Headline inflation remains well below our inflation aim, while core inflation has been hovering around 1 percent for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">At one level, the reduction in labour market slack is translating into higher compensation per employee   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.2,0)">However, the pass-through of higher wages to domestic price pressures remains muted, it follows that firms are absorbing higher unit labour costs through lower profit margins  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.6,0)">While the reasons for this limited pass-through have yet to be fully explained, a contributing factor is the weakness in the manufacturing sector, as reflected by weaker supply chain price pressures compared with the services sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.64,0)">The European Commission’s indicators of three-months-ahead selling price expectations show that they have deteriorated in the manufacturing sector but have held up well in the services sector  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">“Understanding low wage growth in the euro area and European countries”, Occasional Paper Series, No 232, ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.76,0)">The blue line shows deviations of compensation per employee growth from its model-implied mean.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.69,0)">Contributions   are also shown as deviations from their model-implied mean.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Contributions are derived as in Yellen, J.L.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.34,0)">“Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy”, speech at the Philip Gamble Memorial Lecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst.Latest observation: Q4 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.99,0)">Latest observation: August 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.99,0)">Meanwhile, market-based indicators of future inflation outcomes have stagnated at historical lows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">For instance, although the likelihood of deflation remains limited, the market assessment of the probability of low inflation over the next five years, as derived from options prices, has increased substantially since the turn of the year  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.75,0)">Latest observation: 12 September 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The ECB staff projections published last week now point to headline inflation of 1.2 percent in 2019, 1.0 percent in 2020 and 1.5 percent in 2021.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.61,0)">Compared with the June projections, the profile for headline inflation has been revised down by 0.1 percentage points in 2019 and 2021, and by 0.4 percentage points in 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.14,0)">Although the downward revisions to headline inflation are partly due to the volatile energy component, projections for HICP inflation excluding food and energy have also been revised down on account of weaker data outturns, softer activity, indirect effects from lower energy prices and persistent past over-predictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.54,0)">Last week’s policy meeting also took place against the background of a pronounced fall in risk-free rates that we have been observing since the start of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.78,0)">In part, this is a global pattern, with US long-term yields also declining  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.79,0)">This suggests that there is a substantial shared component in the decline in long-term rates that reflects a significant weight being attached to sub-par long-term outcomes for growth and inflation across advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.43,0)">The downward revision in long-term yields incorporates the market’s assessment that central banks will respond   to adverse developments in the inflation outlook by lowering policy rates and further contributing to the easing of financial conditions through the compression of term premia  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.5,0)">While the lower rates that we have observed have contributed to an overall loosening of financial conditions since the start of the year, it is important to keep in mind that long-term rates that are declining due to a deterioration of the economic outlook, an adverse shift in the risk distribution or revised calculations of the equilibrium real interest rate offer only limited easing potential, especially if they are not backed up by active use of the policy toolkit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The case for a monetary policy response was clear, and a comprehensive package of measures was judged to be the most effective way to support the convergence of inflation to our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This was essentially a clarification of our reaction function: our determination to act when inflation falls short of our medium-term inflation aim is just as strong as our determination to act when inflation exceeds that aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Stating clearly our commitment to symmetry is important, since the formulation of our aim – “below, but close to, 2 percent” – risks being misunderstood, particularly in an environment of falling inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.57,0)">We also stressed in July that both realised and projected inflation have been persistently below levels that are in line with our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This was also an important facet of our communication because the “close to” formulation of our inflation aim does not provide a precise numeric anchor for inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In line with our commitment to symmetry, the downward revisions to the projected inflation path warranted a vigorous policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">We therefore announced a broad-based set of measures designed to complement each other in providing monetary stimulus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Our measures will lock in financial conditions across various segments of the market that are sufficiently supportive to foster a reacceleration of growth and the anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Favourable financing conditions will pass through to the borrowing costs of businesses and households, which will sustain investment and consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Greater business and household expenditure, in turn, is one key condition for inflation to converge to our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In addition, our policies create a cushion to insulate the economy from the materialisation of downside risks by reducing uncertainty about future financing conditions and underpinning confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me first outline our adjustments to the instruments that primarily affect the expected path of short-term interest rates and thereby the expectations component of long-term interest rates: the level of the key policy rates and forward guidance on the expected path of these rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.19,0)">We decided to lower the interest rate on the deposit facility by 10 basis points to -0.5 percent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the context of ample excess liquidity, the deposit facility rate is the anchor for the EONIA market interest rate – which is the starting point of the monetary policy transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The EONIA anchors the overnight indexed swap curve in the euro area, which in turn underlies the pricing of many financial instruments and, in particular, underpins the reference rates that are important for loan rate fixation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.3,0)">Lowering the deposit facility rate therefore affects the entire term structure of interest rates and, ultimately, the funding costs that matter for businesses and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Negative rates have supported the portfolio rebalancing channel of the asset purchase programme   by encouraging banks to lend to the broad economy instead of holding onto liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The impact of the cut in the deposit facility rate on the term structure of interest rates is reinforced by our forward guidance, which now strengthens the conditionality criteria for interest rate normalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We strengthened our state-contingent forward guidance in a number of ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">These enhancements complement our emphasis on symmetry by clarifying our reaction function with respect to developments in the inflation outlook: the strengthened guidance provides a clear signpost for rate expectations by linking our policy to more stringent conditions for the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Specifically, the guidance now gives a clearer indication of what we want to see before policy interest rates start to normalise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">As communicated last week, we expect to keep the key ECB interest rates at present or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This formulation provides a conditionality framework with a number of elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">First, we want to see inflation rising to a level that is sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.28,0)">This reflects our communication in July: realised and projected inflation are too low relative to our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Second, we have preserved the forward-looking formulation of our forward guidance, since the guidance has a medium-term orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This reflects the general principle that monetary policy takes time to display its full effects and thus should be forward-looking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Third, we have added two safeguards to anchor the notion of sustainability, which has always been part of our guidance but is now more clearly stated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">The phrase “robustly converge” means that the Governing Council wants to be sure that the process of convergence is sufficiently mature and realistic before starting to lift policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">The qualification that convergence needs to be “consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics” means that the trajectory of realised inflation should underpin our inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">State-contingent forward guidance is especially effective under conditions of elevated uncertainty since it facilitates a smooth adjustment to the evolution of macroeconomic and financial conditions in both directions: expectations about the future policy path will respond in a stabilising manner to the emergence of positive or negative news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">We also retained the so-called easing bias by stating our expectation to keep the key ECB interest rates “at present or lower” levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.05,0)">We judge that, if needed, we can further lower the deposit facility rate and, with it, the overnight money market rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.94,0)">As a result, there is no reason for the distribution of future short-term rate expectations to be skewed upwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.67,0)">Finally, we dropped the date-based leg of our forward guidance since the strengthened state-contingent information, which links our policy more tightly to the inflation outlook, provides sufficient guidance to markets on the future path of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">We also decided to restart net asset purchases at a monthly pace of €20 billion as from the beginning of November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Our purchases are expected to run for as long as necessary to reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates, and to end shortly before we start raising the key ECB interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">In addition, we reiterated our intention to continue reinvesting, in full, maturing principals for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Renewed net asset purchases and the revised forward guidance on policy rates also imply an expansion of the reinvestment envelope and the automatic response of the reinvestment horizon to the evolution of the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Finally, based on our projections on the size and evolution of the purchasable universe, we are confident that the envisaged purchase volumes will be consistent with the current parameters of the APP for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.52,0)">Additional net asset purchases and, by implication, the revised reinvestment horizon reinforce the accommodative impact of our policy rates in several ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.54,0)">First, by affecting term premia, net purchases and reinvestment complement the downward impact on long-term interest rates exerted by our policy rate forward guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The APP therefore provides further support to the funding costs that matter for businesses and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Second, asset purchases entail a signalling channel by demonstrating our commitment to use all instruments in pursuit of our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.49,0)">This not only influences the expected path of short-term policy rates, and thereby long-term interest rates, it can also have a powerful effect on the formation of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Third, the APP entails wealth effects on the balance sheets of banks and other entities, providing further impetus to investment and consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Fourth, new net purchases and a prolonged reinvestment horizon mitigate the passive tightening in the monetary policy stance that happens mechanically as the APP portfolio ages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.22,0)">One of the channels through which asset purchases work is the duration channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.69,0)">By absorbing duration risk from the market, the APP reduces the risk compensation required by investors, which puts downward pressure on term premia and yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.13,0)">As the bonds we hold in our portfolio come closer to maturing, however, the overall amount of duration risk that is tied up in our portfolio progressively falls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.66,0)">As a result, the downward impact on risk premia – and thereby on long-term interest rates – resulting from the duration channel weakens over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Adding to the stock of asset purchases – both directly and through the reinvestment channel – will keep this portfolio ageing effect at bay  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">, Nyholm, K., Radde, S. and Vladu, A.L.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">, “Tracing the impact of the ECB’s asset purchase programme on the yield curve”, Working Paper Series, No 2293, ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The reinvestment horizon is assumed to be five years starting in the month after the announced end of net purchases at each point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.02,0)">The chart does not account for the new asset purchases announced in September 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">To ensure the continued smooth transmission of our monetary policy stance, we decided to adjust the parameters of the new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations   and announce a two-tier system for reserve remuneration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Both measures serve to mitigate the risk of possible side effects of the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance on bank-based intermediation undermining the sustained convergence of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.07,0)">With respect to the TLTROs, we eliminated the 10 basis point spread over the key policy rates entailed in the initial pricing of the operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The interest rate in each operation will now be set at the level of the average rate applied in the main refinancing operations over the life of the respective TLTRO.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.91,0)">For banks whose eligible net lending exceeds a benchmark, the rate applied in the TLTRO III operation will be lower, and can be as low as the average interest rate on the deposit facility prevailing over the life of the operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">In addition, the maturity of the operations will be extended from two to three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">These changes will not only ensure the smooth transmission of monetary policy, they will also preserve favourable bank lending conditions and support the accommodative stance of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In particular, extending the maturity from two to three years will better align the operations with the typical maturity of bank-based financing of investment projects, thereby enhancing the support that TLTRO III provides to the financing of the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The adjustments to the TLTRO III parameters signal that the Governing Council can act in an agile manner and fine-tune its monetary policy instruments, as needed, to ensure that they are efficient, effective and proportionate to the risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Complementing the TLTRO III operations, the two-tier system for reserve remuneration – which will take effect on 30 October 2019 – supports the bank-based transmission mechanism, as it will mitigate the adverse side effects of negative interest rates on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This system has been calibrated to strike a balance between, on the one hand, offsetting the direct cost of negative interest rates on bank profitability, thereby helping to sustain the pass-through of low policy rates to bank lending rates, and on the other, preserving the positive contribution of negative rates to the accommodative stance of monetary policy and the continued sustained convergence of inflation to our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Reconciling these two goals is possible, since the value of funds in the money market is determined by their cost at the margin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">That marginal cost will continue to be set by the rate on our deposit facility, and it will not be influenced by the higher remuneration that banks will receive on the portion of their reserves that will be exempt under the new scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The excess liquidity that will be created in exchange for the additional bond purchases that start in November will also further increase the non-exempt amount, which has already been calibrated in such a way as to preserve a high level of trading activity in the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">In any case, we will actively monitor conditions in the money market and adjust parameters as necessary to maintain an active trading environment and to ensure that the easing effects of a reduction in the overnight interest rate are transmitted effectively through the entire yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">To sum up, the measures we announced last week complement each other and together constitute a powerful package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">As I previously noted, the evidence shows that our monetary policy measures have been an effective response to the environment that the ECB has faced in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.69,0)">The cut in the deposit facility rate lowers the anchor for the entire term structure of interest rates, while the forward guidance on interest rates steers expectations of the short-term interest rate path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The forward guidance protects the short to medium-term segment of the yield curve from unnecessary volatility by eliminating residual uncertainty about the expected rate path over the forward guidance horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In addition, it helps to steer the long end of the yield curve by affecting the expectations component of long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Renewed net asset purchases reinforce the downward pressure on long-term rates by reducing risk premia, and also complement the impact of forward guidance on the expected short-term rate path by signalling the Governing Council’s commitment to maintain a highly accommodative monetary policy stance for a prolonged period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">New net asset purchases will also mitigate the mechanical upward pressure on long-term rates that ensues from the gradual ageing of our portfolio and the associated loss of duration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Both the net asset purchase horizon and the reinvestment horizon are linked to our interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">They will therefore adjust dynamically to changes in the inflation outlook and work in the background to keep a lid on medium to long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Meanwhile, the changes in the TLTRO III parameters and the two-tier system for reserve remuneration will ensure that lower market interest rates are effectively passed through to the interest rates banks charge their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.75,0)">Concluding remarks The convergence of inflation towards the Governing Council’s aim has recently slowed and partly reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The comprehensive package of measures decided last week will help to support the convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2 percent in a sustained manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Our policy decisions will affect inflation by supporting favourable financing conditions, and thereby growth, as well as by underpinning inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">It is clear that a highly accommodative stance of monetary policy will be necessary for a prolonged period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Forward guidance on the key ECB policy rates is a very powerful instrument and remains our principal tool, together with the level of our key policy rates, for adjusting the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The asset purchase programme is an important complement to our interest rate policy and will dynamically adjust in line with our policy rate forward guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Backed by our assessment of the empirical evidence, we are confident that our monetary policy measures remain effective in fostering a reacceleration of growth and, thereby, inflation convergence, and we are determined to adjust all of our instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation converges durably to our aim, in line with our commitment to symmetry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The ECB’s mandate for price stability is unconditional, and the Governing Council is unwavering in its commitment to achieve its inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Finally, as I have outlined today, our monetary policy decisions are driven by our assessment of the macroeconomic and financial environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">As noted in last week’s introductory statement, other policy pillars play a critical role in determining the long-term and short-term prospects for the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Growth-enhancing institutional and structural reforms and a more growth-friendly composition of public finances can play important roles in boosting the long-run potential of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">At the cyclical level, fiscal policy can contain the impact of adverse shocks through the operation of automatic stabilisers and, where feasible and effective, through the timing of discretionary fiscal measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">All else being equal, the more fiscal policy contributes to boosting long-term growth potential and providing cyclical stabilisation, the quicker will be the effects of monetary policy interventions on inflation and the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">After the procyclical tightening of the aggregate fiscal stance in response to the euro area sovereign debt crisis, and a neutral stance during the economic upswing, the current mildly expansionary euro area fiscal stance is providing some support to economic activity  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">In view of the weakening economic outlook and the continued prominence of downside risks, governments with fiscal space that are facing a slowdown should act in an effective and timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Where fiscal sustainability is ensured, the potential effectiveness of countercyclical fiscal policy is reinforced in the current environment, given that fiscal multipliers are higher in a low interest rate environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">At the same time, governments in countries with high public debt should pursue prudent policies and deliver on structural balance targets.</span><span
