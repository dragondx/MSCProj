    <h2> Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, Exchange of Views on Financial Services Policy 2005 - 2010, European Commission Brussels, 18 July 2005 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)"> Financial services policy 2005-2010: the ECB’s view Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, Exchange of Views on Financial Services Policy 2005 – 2010, European CommissionBrussels, 18 July 2005 Introduction I would like to thank the European Commission for the invitation to participate in this important event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">I am sure that all discussions today on the Commission’s Green Paper on Financial Services Policy in 2005-2010 will be highly beneficial for finalizing its thoughts on the matter, which will be reflected in the White Paper to be issued by the end of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">The definition of the main priorities for financial services policy in the years to come is an important milestone in the pursuit of further financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Although it should be recognized that financial integration in the EU has proceeded apace in recent years, in particular as a consequence of the introduction of the euro, further progress still needs to be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">While the objective of financial integration is inherent in the achievement of the Single Market, it is currently also extremely important in the context of the Lisbon reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Financial integration is a key factor in the development and modernisation of the financial system which, in turn, can lead to greater productivity and competitiveness, a more efficient allocation of capital and the potential for greater and more sustainable non-inflationary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">For example, an empirical study by London Economics  estimated additional growth resulting from financial integration of the European bond and equity markets to be 1.1% over a decade or so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me give you the views of the ECB on the proposals put forward by the Commission, noting that the Eurosystem is preparing a contribution on this subject, which will be issued shortly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I should underline that the interest of the Eurosystem in the pursuit of financial integration is closely related to the tasks which have been given to it by the Treaty, including the conduct of the single monetary policy, the promotion of smooth payment and settlement systems and the contribution to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I will start with some general considerations and then turn to some specific areas, notably financial regulation, financial supervision, and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">General considerations Speaking generally, let me express broad support for the key policy orientations set out in the Green Paper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Over the next five years, financial services policy should aim primarily at consolidating and simplifying existing Community legislation, while ensuring that the measures adopted thus far under the Financial Services Action Plan   are effectively and consistently implemented and enforced at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Behind this broad orientation lies the shared notion that the main efforts to remove residual legal and regulatory obstacles to the free provision of financial services in the EU have been achieved with the FSAP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Therefore the adoption of new Community legislative initiatives should be evidence-based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The role of public intervention in regulating the EU financial sector remains important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.3,0)">First, developments in financial markets will always pose challenges to the existing regulatory framework that have to be considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.22,0)">Second, the consistent and correct implementation of FSAP measures at the national level remains a challenging task for all authorities involved, notably the Commission, national governments and supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Third, the importance of the work of consolidating and simplifying the existing EU regulatory framework proposed by the Commission should not be underestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Indeed, this work represents a window of opportunity for rationalizing the existing rules applicable to financial institutions, especially those operating on a cross-border basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It also involves the pursuit of synergies among the several EU public policies applicable to the financial sector, notably financial services, consumer and competition policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">If this process is successful, responsibility for promoting financial integration will then chiefly lie with financial institutions themselves, which should exploit the framework promoted by public authorities to expand their activity across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In this context, I would emphasise that this is also dependent on the ability of the financial industry to coordinate its members effectively whenever common initiatives are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This applies for instance in the areas of payment and securities clearing and settlement systems, where common infrastructures benefit cross-border transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In this field there is also a specific role for public authorities, notably to serve as catalysts for coordination among market participants, thus facilitating the emergence of market-led initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">One example is the role played by the Eurosystem in the promotion of the Single Euro Payments Area – SEPA – project, where the ECB, together with the European Commission, strongly supports the integration of retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Financial regulation Turning to the area of financial regulation, let me highlight three aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">First, there is a need to proceed with the adoption of the remaining measures envisaged in the FSAP in order to complete the regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In this respect, from the ECB’s perspective, the planned legislative work in the field of securities clearing and settlement is very important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">An efficient securities clearing and settlement infrastructure is of fundamental importance for the integration and efficiency of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Therefore, the ECB supports the Commission’s intention to put forward a proposal for a directive on securities clearing and settlement for two reasons: a directive will help remove residual barriers – as identified by the “Giovannini Group” – to efficient EU clearing and settlement arrangements and will also provide a legal basis for securities clearing and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In this context, the work which has been conducted jointly by the ESCB and the Committee of European Securities Regulators   in setting standards on clearing and settlement systems can assist the competent authorities in their oversight and supervisory activities in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Second, with regard to possible new legislative initiatives at the Community level, we agree with the principle – put forward by the Commission – that stronger efforts should be made ex-ante to better evaluate their possible costs and benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">As to the areas where such efforts could potentially be made, those identified by the Commission, notably retail financial services and asset management, certainly warrant reflection and attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">In the area of retail financial services, the suggested combination of targeted regulatory action and more active application of competition policy could be the way forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As regards asset management, one of the main issues seems to be whether regulatory treatment at the EU level targeted specifically at the category of hedge funds is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Whereas I think it is legitimate to reflect on the pros and cons of possible regulation, I strongly believe that any regulatory response, if it proves necessary, should be taken in a coordinated manner at the international level  , given the global nature of the hedge fund industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Third, the envisaged process of consolidation of existing legislation represents an opportunity not only for rationalization but also to promote a truly common set of rules for financial institutions, especially those operating on a cross-border basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This principle seems to be contained in the Commission’s proposal to launch a feasibility study on whether the relevant rules at the national and the European levels could be structured as a “financial services rulebook”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">I support this concept: a financial services rulebook may constitute a significant contribution to reducing complexity and possible inconsistencies in the overall regulatory framework for the single financial market as well as possible legal uncertainties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">More generally, I believe that the Lamfalussy framework contains all the elements needed to effectively pursue the objectives set out by the Commission in the area of financial regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Financial supervision Turning to the area of financial supervision, the ECB shares the “evolutionary” approach proposed by the Commission which is based on:   the definition of and agreement on policy objectives;   the full exploitation of the current institutional framework; and   the notion that the creation of new structures should only be considered if the current set-up is deemed unable to fulfil such objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Concerning policy objectives, there is broad agreement that financial supervision should have two main aims.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The first is to facilitate the development of cross-border finance, both in terms of financial institutions   and products and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">There is clearly potential for this development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Let me mention a few figures with regard to the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.68,0)">The number of credit institutions in the euro area declined from around 12,000 in 1985 to 9,500 in 1995 and to 6,400 in 2004, which is mainly attributable to mergers and acquisitions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.77,0)">These operations have mainly taken place between institutions based in the same country: between 1985 and 2005, cross-border transactions accounted for less than 20% in terms of number and value of all M&A deals in the euro area and in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Cross-border transactions are however increasing: since the setting up of the euro, between1999 and the start of 2005, cross-border M&A operations accounted for about 30% of all deals in terms of numbers and 24% in terms of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The second objective is to maintain the effectiveness of supervisory standards and action as the financial markets become more and more integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The current institutional set-up, and in particular the Lamfalussy framework, provide the appropriate infrastructure for achieving these broad policy objectives, if it is used to the maximum extent possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This entails pursuing two operational goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">The first is the achievement of supervisory convergence by the Level 3 committees which should deliver consistent supervisory action on a cross-border basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Eventually, the success of the Committee of Banking Supervisors  , CESR and the Committee of European Insurance and Occupational Pension Supervisors   will be measured mainly on the basis of their ability to deliver effectively on the issue of supervisory convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Looking at CEBS – the committee most involved so far in the area of supervisory convergence, whereas CESR and CEIOPS have focussed more on their advisory role for draft Community legislation – the experience thus far is encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Based on the number of consultation papers released by CEBS reflecting agreement among banking supervisors on a number of issues  , one cannot fail to note that substantive progress is being made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.79,0)">Of course, a major challenge in this field remains compliance by individual supervisors with the non-binding deliberations of the Level 3 committees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Transparency of implementation measures by supervisory authorities is expected to play an important role in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">The second operational goal is the deepening of the cooperation between home and host authorities for the supervision of financial groups operating across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This is an essential step for reconciling within the existing framework the interests of supervisory authorities and of the industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Cross-border cooperation among supervisors should become so smooth and effective in practice as to be perceived by the industry as unified action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">In the banking sector, the work being undertaken by CEBS in this area to develop a robust model for coordination and cooperation to be used by all supervisory authorities provides an important contribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">In addition to a cooperation framework, willingness on the part of supervisors to cooperate effectively on an ongoing basis is also important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.37,0)">Lack of progress on this front would fuel demands for a revision of the current institutional set-up as implicit in the notion of “lead supervisor” advocated by part of the banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">The review of the Lamfalussy approach due by the end of 2007 should represent the opportunity to form a comprehensive judgement about the effectiveness of progress made in the supervisory field and the possible way forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Let me add on the subject of supervision that the ECB fully supports the planned review by the Commission of the current regime for liquidity supervision, which represents an exception to the general principle of home country control as the host authority is responsible for the liquidity supervision of a foreign branch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Developments in financial markets, such as centralisation of liquidity management by banks and the introduction of the euro, call perhaps for reconsideration of host country responsibility for liquidity supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The ECB intends to contribute to this work, given the interest of central banks in liquidity matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Financial stability I now turn finally to the area of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This remains one of the main objectives of financial services policy at the EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The interaction between financial integration and financial stability is a complex one and thus warrants close attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Financial integration can provide the necessary conditions for a smoother absorption of shocks by financial institutions and offers them more options for managing and diversifying their risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">On the other hand, particular attention has to be given to the profound challenges to financial stability due to the structural transformation of the financial system, including intensified cross-border links.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Therefore, effective arrangements for financial stability need to be maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">I would say that significant progress has been achieved in this field over the years, particularly as a result of the activities of the Economic and Financial Committee   as well as the work of the Eurosystem, with support from the ESCB Banking Supervision Committee  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I would just mention in this respect the EFC recommendations in the area of financial stability and crisis management and the agreements, in the form of multilateral memoranda of understanding, on cooperation in crisis situations among the central banks, banking supervisors and ministries of finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Looking ahead, I see three areas where public action could focus: financial stability assessment, management of financial stress, and deposit insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">First, as regards the assessment of the financial stability of the EU, the current set-up based on the EFC Financial Stability Table, mirroring the Financial Stability Forum, is certainly useful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The periodic discussions in the Table allow views to be formed at the EU level of the main areas of vulnerability for the financial system and the strength of its resilience to potential shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The ECB contributes to these discussions by providing the outcome of its euro area-wide financial stability monitoring, conducted with the support of the BSC and reflected in the Financial Stability Review which, since December 2004 has been made available to the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Although the monitoring of economic risks is well developed in this context, there is room for enhancing the analysis of risks of a more structural nature and having a cross-sector dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">To that end, closer collaboration between the Level 3 committees and the BSC is desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Second, as regards management of financial crises, further clarification of the arrangements for effective cooperation among the relevant authorities is a major priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">For instance, the BSC and the CEBS are jointly developing proposals for further enhancing cooperation between central banks and banking supervisors, particularly in terms of identifying best practices for handling financial crises and building up operational network mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Furthermore, the Green Paper refers to emergency liquidity assistance   as an area where a review would be undertaken by all the relevant parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I would like to note that the provision of ELA is a central bank function and an agreement exists within the Eurosystem on how this facility operates in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is my perception that there are no specific issues relating to the provision of ELA which need to be addressed at the EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Third, as regards deposit insurance, which is an important component of the financial safety net, the ECB supports the initiative of the Commission to review the existing Deposit Guarantee Directive to ascertain whether greater convergence of national schemes is desirable from the perspective of both financial integration and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">The main areas of this review appear to be the reduction of national differences, which may become particularly relevant in the case of cross-border banking, and the pursuit of formal cooperation between the different national schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">* * * Let me conclude by underlining once again the broad support for the key orientations put forward in the Green Paper and by thanking the Commission for its close and transparent cooperation with all interested parties during the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">London Economics  , “Quantification of the macro-economic impact of integration of EU financial markets”, Report to the European
