    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.58,0)"> State of play in the European banking sector Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, IIF Annual Meeting, Washington D.C., 13 October 2017 It is quite difficult to present my views on the state of the euro area banking sector in such a short statement – there are more than 100 large and medium-sized banks in 19 countries, with substantial differences between them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">But what I can say is that the banks are in a better position than they were.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">They are better capitalised and have improved their liquidity situation and their governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.19,0)">They are making slow but steady progress in tackling all the well-known challenges and adapting their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Still, supervisors are paid to demand more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">So we want quite a few banks to adapt more quickly to the new environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Digital technology is rapidly gaining traction in the banking world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">It brings new opportunities but also new competitors for each and every bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">And we are seeing more and more banks incorporating a digital dimension into their strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.58,0)">However, they are doing so at varying speeds and we are not always satisfied with their progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">All banks need to focus on transforming their services more quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.44,0)">Interest rates are still low, weighing on the profits of many banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.08,0)">This situation makes it imperative for them to adjust their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Some banks still need to diversify their sources of income, manage their costs more diligently and become more efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.39,0)">Legacy assets, such as non-performing loans, are still high in some parts of the banking sector in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.28,0)">They depress banks’ profits and curb their ability to finance the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The good news is that we are seeing some progress here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.11,0)">The proportion of non-performing loans in the euro area fell from more than 7% in the second quarter of 2015 to below 6% at the beginning of 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Still, I think the banks need to be more ambitious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.56,0)">We are not satisfied with the strategy of each and every bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Some need to act more decisively – and we will push them to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.15,0)">And finally, Brexit is on the horizon, and will have a major impact on the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.51,0)">Most of all, it will affect those banks which access the European market from the United Kingdom and vice versa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">They have to prepare themselves for other forms of market access – and quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.62,0)">All this is happening at a time when the banking sectors of some countries still need to consolidate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let’s turn to Europe’s banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It now rests on two pillars: alongside banking supervision, there is a mechanism that allows us to resolve banks without disrupting the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.4,0)">Banks can fail, and they will fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">That became clear earlier this year when the new system passed its first test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What is still missing, though, is the third pillar of the banking union: a joint deposit insurance scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">But the first two pillars alone ensure that the most critical aspects are covered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.32,0)">Banks, their owners and their creditors not only have to comply with stricter rules and more intrusive supervision; they are also subject to greater market discipline as it has become clear that they can be allowed to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">It is up to each bank to endeavour not only to survive but also to prosper in these circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">And the good news is that it is possible to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Our analyses have revealed that there are a number of banks which consistently outperform their peers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">So there is progress and hope, but only for those who understand this new world, accept it, and act accordingly.</span>
