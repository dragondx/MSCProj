    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)"> The success of the euro and its impact on European companies Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the Congress on Small-sized Enterprises, organized by Confindustria, Bari, Italy, 18 March 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Signore, Signori, è per me un grande piacere contribuire oggi al dibattito sulle sfide poste alle imprese italiane ed europee dalla crescente concorrenza internazionale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Circa centoquaranta anni fa Italia, Francia, Belgio e Svizzera diedero vita all’Unione monetaria latina al fine di accrescere la concorrenza, gli scambi commerciali e, in ultima analisi, il benessere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">L’unione si fondava sull’accettazione reciproca delle monete in oro e in argento dei rispettivi paesi.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">L’esperimento tuttavia fallì.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Dopo un lungo periodo di forti oscillazioni del valore relativo delle monete, accompagnate da elevata instabilità macroeconomica nei paesi aderenti, l’Unione monetaria latina venne sciolta al termine della prima guerra mondiale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Quale lezione possiamo trarre da questa prima esperienza?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">E quali sono state le carenze di questo progetto?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">A mio avviso mancavano quattro elementi fondamentali: stabilità politica, un mercato comune, criteri di convergenza e una banca centrale comune.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Per la realizzazione dell’Unione monetaria latina non era stato svolto alcun preparativo sul piano macroeconomico e fiscale, né era stata creata una banca centrale comune che mettesse in atto le più basilari misure di controllo valutario congiunto.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">A ottantacinque anni dalla fine dell’unione possiamo affermare di avere imparato dall’esperienza passata.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In un quadro caratterizzato da stabilità politica, quaranta anni di integrazione economica, commerciale e finanziaria hanno aperto la strada all’Unione monetaria europea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Stabilità dei prezzi e solide politiche di bilancio hanno costituito il fondamento dell’Unione monetaria negli ultimi sei anni e vanno pertanto preservate anche in futuro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Quest’oggi mi soffermerò in primo luogo su quelli che considero i principali successi dell’euro per le imprese europee e, più in generale, per i cittadini europei.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In estrema sintesi, stabilità macroeconomica, integrazione finanziaria ed efficienza economica rappresentano importanti conquiste dell’Unione monetaria, indispensabili al fine di promuovere la crescita economica e la creazione di occupazione da parte delle imprese europee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">In secondo luogo, mi soffermerò sulle aree che necessitano ancora di riforme volte a migliorare la competitività e quindi a favorire una crescita economica sostenibile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">La stabilità monetaria e un contesto economico più aperto, efficiente e concorrenziale richiedono importanti iniziative complementari da parte dei responsabili delle politiche economiche nazionali.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Mi riferisco al bisogno urgente di completare il processo di attuazione delle riforme strutturali, principalmente nei mercati del lavoro, dei beni e servizi e dei capitali.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Inizio ora a illustrare i principali successi dell’euro realizzati finora.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here today in order to contribute to the debate on the challenges that Italian and European enterprises are currently facing with respect to increasing global competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">To enhance competition, trade and ultimately welfare, about 140 years ago Italy, France, Belgium and Switzerland gave birth to the Latin Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This monetary union was based on the mutual acceptance of each other’s gold and silver coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.51,0)">That experiment failed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.68,0)">After a long period of strong fluctuations in the relative values of gold and silver, combined with high macroeconomic instability across the member countries, the Latin Monetary Union was finally dismantled by the end of World War I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Can we learn something from this early experience?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.62,0)">What was missing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In my view there were four key missing ingredients, namely, political stability, a Common Market, the existence of convergence criteria and a common central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.51,0)">No macroeconomic and fiscal preparations were made before the start of the Latin Monetary Union, no common central bank was in place to exert even the simplest measures of joint monitoring over currency issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">85 years after the end of that regime we had clearly learnt our lessons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">In a framework characterized by political stability, a history of 40 years of economic, trade and financial integration had paved the way for the European Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The stability oriented macroeconomic framework, based on price stability and sound fiscal policies, has been the basis of the Economic and Monetary Union   in the past six years, and we should keep this framework in place in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Today I will first discuss in some detail what I see as the main successes of the euro for European enterprises and more in general for European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Macroeconomic stability, financial integration and economic efficiency have been key achievements of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">These achievements are of utmost importance for enhancing lasting growth and employment creation of European companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Secondly I will reflect on the areas which still require reforms in order to raise competitiveness and ultimately economic growth in a sustainable manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Monetary stability and a more open, efficient and competitive economic environment require important complementary initiatives by national policy makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">I am referring to the urgent need to complete the process of structural reforms, chiefly in the labour, product and capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Let me start with the key successes of the euro to date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Successes of the euro Six years after the start of EMU, we can already count successes on a number of fronts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">First, the success of the euro was a technical success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The integration of money markets enabled a smooth implementation of the single monetary policy from early January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The transformation of European financial markets brought about by the euro has been remarkable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The global trend of closer financial market integration witnessed in the past decade has received a distinct additional boost by the introduction of the euro in EMU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The introduction of the euro has dismantled barriers to cross-border trading and enhanced risk sharing and opportunities for diversification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The elimination of exchange rate risk has increased the depth and breadth of financial markets and boosted financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Government bond yields have become nearly perfectly correlated in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">There is also evidence of closer integration of stock markets in the euro area than elsewhere .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The euro had a particularly significant impact on the European market for corporate bonds, with a considerable increase in the number of medium-sized firms placing issues outside their home country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Financial deepening has of course benefited the Italian markets as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">In Italy, between 1999 and 2003 the volume of funds raised directly on the financial markets by firms issuing shares, bonds and other instruments grew from 31 billion to 65 billion euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Over the same period the amount of Italian households’ financial wealth held in the form of corporate securities increased from 22 to 36% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Financial integration has facilitated the consolidation of financial structures, thereby increasing cross-border corporate linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In recent years, large flows of foreign direct investment among euro area countries have exemplified this intensification of corporate linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The second key success of the euro relates to the convergence of long-term market interest rates towards those of the best performers in terms of credibility and low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In most countries, including Italy, this convergence has meant significantly reduced financing costs, thereby providing an environment favourable to growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.47,0)">Thanks to the stability oriented macroeconomic policy framework, focusing on price stability and on sound fiscal policies, - that is the two missing elements of the Latin Monetary Union - risk premia have declined and inflation expectations have stabilized at low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Today, the euro area economy benefits from benchmark long-term market interest rates below 4%, a level which most issuers have never seen in the last fifty years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.71,0)">In Italy the 10-year interest rate spread versus the best performers fell from 4.5 percentage points at the beginning of 1996 to 0.3 percentage points at the beginning of 1998 and to 0.2 percentage points at the end of 2004  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">These two major achievements must be maintained by today’s and future economic policy making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">As a third point I would like to mention the improved resilience of the euro area economies against financial crises that the euro has brought about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Also in this respect, European corporations and, amongst them, Italian enterprises have largely benefited from the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Italy as well as many other European countries experienced several episodes of large exchange rate and interest rate volatility between the 1970s and the mid-1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.62,0)">Without the single currency, events in recent years -- such as the turbulence that followed the September 11 terrorist attacks or the swings in global exchange and stock markets -- would have triggered major turbulences in Europe as a whole and in many euro area economies, including Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.43,0)">This, of course, does not mean that external factors have no longer been an important driving force in determining the economic performance of the EMU countries in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">However, euro area economies proved to be more resilient to external shocks in the 2001-2003 downturn, which were mainly caused by a correction of stock market prices and financial instability, than to the external shocks in the downturn of the early 1990s, which were mainly driven by exchange rates volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Fourth, let me highlight the convergence of inflation rates to low levels across euro area countries thanks to the adoption of stability-oriented macroeconomic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">A remarkable convergence among euro area member states took already place over the 1990s, triggered by the preparations for EMU, and this process has continued in the years after the start of the EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Measured by the standard deviation, the dispersion of inflation rates has more than halved in the period 1999-2004 with respect to the years preceding the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Low and stable inflation has been a fundamental achievement for the euro area as a whole as well as for Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Italian inflation was 4% in 1996 while in the countries that are now part of the euro area it was on average equal to 2.3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In subsequent years Italy saw a significant reduction in its inflation gap vis-à-vis the euro area average, despite many adverse shocks that hit both Italy and the euro area in recent years  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.42,0)">Between 1999 and 2004 Italy inflation averaged at 2.4% and euro area inflation at 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Between 2001 and 2003 Italy saw a sizeable increase of perceived inflation  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.08,0)">The concept of perceived inflation aims to measure changes in the inflation rate which consumers think that have occurred in the recent past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Usually we can observe a good correlation between the behaviour of actual and perceived inflation, which means that consumers have a relatively correct perception about the changes in their purchasing power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.86,0)">In Italy and in some other countries the patterns of actual inflation and perceived inflation started to diverge after the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">While this is a feature which should not be ignored, since what consumers decide to spend depends on their perceived real income, it is now important to acknowledge that it was a temporary phenomenon, and that during the last year and half the gap between actual and perceived inflation has narrowed significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Notwithstanding the many adverse shocks that hit the euro area in the past years, price stability has prevailed in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The success of the single currency in delivering price stability and stabilizing inflation expectations in the euro area can be explained by the European institutional framework and the principles followed by the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">First, the European Central Bank is independent and has a clearly defined mandate given by the Treaty to pursue price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Second, the ECB has provided and made public an arithmetical definition of price stability corresponding to inflation rates below and close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Third, the medium-term orientation and the very nature of our concept of monetary policy contributes to a solid anchoring of medium and long term inflation expectations, in line with our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The best contribution that monetary policy can provide to economic growth is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Price stability ensures the transparency of the relative price mechanism, thus enhancing the efficiency of resource allocation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Stable and low inflation supports private consumption via its positive impact on the real value of households’ income and wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Price stability reduces the borrowing costs for individuals and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.92,0)">As we all know, inflation erodes the purchasing power of the nominal return on long-term loan contracts or bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">In case of high and uncertain inflation, savers or those who lend their liquid funds would require a higher rate of return from borrowers, in order to compensate for the higher risks related to the uncertainty about future inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.05,0)">This inflation risk premium implies that in an economy with high inflation, less investment projects will be profitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.21,0)">In such circumstances, capital accumulation will be lower than it could have been in a situation of price stability and the potential output growth rate is consequently reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The challenge of economic growth Let me now turn to some issues which still need to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The Economic and Monetary Union has secured macroeconomic stability, has promoted financial integration and led to convergence of inflation and interest rates to low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.25,0)">The key question that naturally arises is the following: Why has economic growth, nonetheless, remained subdued?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In my introduction I have already hinted at my answer by referring to the need for completing structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me now elaborate further on this urgency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The first message I would like to convey is that the need to raise economic growth in a sustainable manner is a common challenge for most of the euro area countries and for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The need to introduce supply side changes, aimed at boosting potential output growth is a common challenge to most European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.16,0)">Over the last decade real GDP growth has averaged just 2.1% in the euro area  , significantly below the 3.4% growth rate of the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The second point I would like to make is that competitiveness is a key driver of sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">In recent years euro area companies have been facing stronger external competition, especially from low-cost producers in the very dynamic Asian economies, but also from those in the new EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It is the reason why unit labour costs are such an important indicator, particularly in a single currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Let us look at Italy as an example but there are many others in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In Italy nominal unit labour costs in the total economy and especially in the manufacturing sector - the most export oriented sector - have grown significantly faster than in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.64,0)">Let me just mention a couple of figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Over the last six years, in Italy the cumulated growth rate of unit labour cost in the manufacturing sector was equal to 15.7% against a euro area average of 3.1%  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.67,0)">What has been driving the strong rises in unit labour costs?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">On the one hand the cumulated growth rate of compensation per employee has been equal to 16.7%, on the other hand the cumulated growth rate of labour productivity has been equal to 1.1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.18,0)">There seems to be something in the wage mechanism that prevents compensation developments from following more closely productivity developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.0,0)">Besides this problem, such protracted weak labour productivity growth needs to be related to intrinsic difficulties in using labour and capital efficiently, possibly due to a lack of innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.31,0)">Why is that happening?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.72,0)">A number of recent comprehensive reports , notably by the Banca d’Italia, ISTAT, Confindustria, and various Italian think-tanks, have emphasized a broad range of institutional and economic factors behind the Italian labour productivity-competitiveness problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.4,0)">Some of them are discussed at your conference today and tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.7,0)">These factors include rigidities in product and labour markets, features of the financial system and corporate governance, low spending on research and development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">All these factors have certainly worked against the efforts of Italian enterprises to increase their size and to improve competitiveness by renewing their products and reallocating resources towards new, more dynamic sectors   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.67,0)">The lack of innovation might be partially related to the small-size of firms, which continues to be a predominant feature of the Italian industrial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.54,0)">In that regard the business environment continues to create obstacles to firm-size expansion and to the entry of new and more efficient firms, thus hampering productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">The costs of opening and closing a business as well as the time required to complete the legal processes involved in enforcing contracts remains well-above the euro area average   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.88,0)">These considerations bring me to my third and final point: structural rigidities have slowed European firms’ responses to structural changes in the production process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.59,0)">As a result, and in contrast to more flexible economies in the international sphere, many economies in Europe have not fully reaped the benefits of the technological advances of the last ten to fifteen years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.8,0)">Many European countries have not adapted their economic, social and legal frameworks in order to face the new challenges triggered by a rapidly transforming world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">A sense of urgency to implement structural reforms was transmitted to European policy-makers last February when the European Commission proposed a “Partnership for Growth and Jobs”  as the core of a renewed Lisbon strategy, by putting forward a program of priority actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">These priority actions can be summarized under three key headings:   to extend and deepen the Single Market;   to build better infrastructure, motivate investment in research and development and facilitate innovation;   to attract more people into employment, improve the flexibility of labour markets and invest more in human capital through better education and skills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me further elaborate on this priority list.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The objective of extending and deepening the Single Market would imply to eliminate market entry barriers in national regulations which continue to hamper competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">This objective would also require improving national and European regulations in terms of simplification, well shaped legislation and effort to reduce the burden of administrative costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The need of fostering knowledge and innovation would require more effective public expenditure and more favourable incentives for companies to engage in innovation and Research and Development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.05,0)">The need of attracting more people to employment would imply in many countries a “re-thinking” about the current mix of tax and benefit systems, which continue to provide disincentives to take up work or to work longer hours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Furthermore, measures to make wage growth reflect more strongly regional and sectoral productivity differences would certainly be helpful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The European Central Bank strongly welcomes these proposals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">They are fully in line with our own views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Indeed, the drivers of success are innovation, productivity enhancement and employment growth and all measures should be directed to achieve these results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Some European countries that are ahead in the process of adopting such changes show that these reforms are able to deliver higher output and employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Not only would these reforms raise potential economic growth, but they would also make the European economies more flexible and thereby strengthen the resilience against economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This in turn would facilitate the pursuit of stability oriented macroeconomic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Concluding remarks Ladies and gentlemen, you are gathered here to discuss the way ahead in order to increase competitiveness and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">In conclusion, let me once again stress that the maintenance of price stability, low medium and long term market interest rates, thanks to this stability, and financial integration are key successes of the Economic and Monetary Union as well as fundamentals conditions to enhance sustainable economic growth, employment creation and welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">In order to reap the full benefits of the single currency and to cope with global competitive pressures, a truly dynamic economic environment needs to be put firmly in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Be assured that the European Central Bank backs the drive towards reforms that is in motion in Europe since the Lisbon consensus in 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">The European Central Bank backs the renewed Lisbon strategy and the Governments of Europe that are embarking courageously on those structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">We do not underestimate the difficulties of the task and the necessity to explain tirelessly to the people of Europe that all will be better off thanks to these reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">We consider we have to fully participate in this pedagogic exercise.</span>
