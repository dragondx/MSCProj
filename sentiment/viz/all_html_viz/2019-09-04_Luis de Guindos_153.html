    <span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)"> The evolution of stress-testing in Europe Keynote speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the annual US-EU Symposium organised by the Program on International Financial Systems, Frankfurt, 4 September 2019 Introduction During the financial crisis, stress tests were primarily used to identify capital shortfalls in the banking sector and to enhance market discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This was achieved through the publication of consistent and granular data on a bank‐by‐bank basis, with banks judged to have either “passed” or “failed” the test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Since the crisis, the way in which stress tests are used has evolved, both in Europe and abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">They have become a key part of the supervisory and financial stability toolkit for assessing risk profiles and performance under adverse macroeconomic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the United States, the regular Dodd-Frank Act stress tests and the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review are now an integral part of the process for determining the capital requirements of large US banks, influencing their capital plans and their dividend distribution policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In Europe, the biennial EU-wide stress tests coordinated by the European Banking Authority   are important inputs for the ECB’s Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In other words, rather than finishing with a pass or fail assessment, stress tests now provide a starting point, both for discussions between banks and supervisors and for macroprudential policymakers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.0,0)">The ECB also conducts a parallel exercise covering the banks under its supervision that are not included in the EBA exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">While this evolution in stress tests has occurred on both sides of the Atlantic – albeit with a few remaining differences in respective approaches – in my remarks today I will take a European perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">In particular, I will focus on two key facets of this evolution – the more integral use of the top-down review process and the advantages of adding a macroprudential perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Current stress test methodology in Europe The EU-wide stress tests involve significant input from the banks, following a so-called constrained bottom-up approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Under this approach, banks generate their stress test projections using their own models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These projections are based on a macro-financial scenario that is the same for all banks and are subject to a predefined methodology prescribed by the EBA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">The constrained bottom-up approach has several advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">By treating all participating banks equally, it ensures a level playing field and provides results that are comparable across banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This is an important element in fostering transparency and market discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Ideally, a bottom-up approach should also support banks’ own risk management capacity by forcing them to consider how severe adverse circumstances may affect their solvency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">It should strengthen their ability to detect vulnerabilities and encourage them to develop their own internal stress-testing models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">But the constrained bottom-up approach is not without drawbacks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.86,0)">The static balance sheet assumption limits the realism of the exercise as it does not account for how banks would respond under stressful situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.05,0)">Certain caps and floors in the stress test methodology may compromise the realism of the stress test outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">The approach also provides banks with substantial leeway to materially underestimate their vulnerability to adverse circumstances, to “game” the exercise, in other words.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Using top-down models to benchmark results As a consequence, European supervisors conduct a thorough quality assurance of banks’ bottom-up stress test results to ensure their outcomes are credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.12,0)">Notably, this includes confronting banks with independent model-based estimates – a so-called top-down model challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.03,0)">This process generally leads to individual banks revising their stress test outcomes before publication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">We believe there is substantial value in this extensive supervisory scrutiny  and in the improved market discipline stemming from the European stress test framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Indeed, discussions about the long-term strategy for the stress tests in Europe are underway at both the ECB/SSM and EBA levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Proposed changes aim to improve the realism of stress test outcomes while retaining their reliability and credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.2,0)">I do not want to pre-empt those discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">But let me focus on one key aspect, namely the importance of top-down models in the context of the European prudential stress tests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">I believe the top-down model challenge, which has so far taken the form of a dialogue between supervisors and banks, could play a greater role in disciplining banks and reducing the incentives for them to systematically underestimate their vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This could be achieved by publishing the top-down view of supervisory stress tests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The mere possibility of this information being made public should by itself encourage banks to produce more credible and sufficiently prudent stress test projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In fact, doing so would provide market participants with a benchmark against which to judge each individual bank’s result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.58,0)">The exact form of publication would need to be considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For example results could be published in aggregate form.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Alternatively, results could be published individually or in ranges, such as grouping banks into solvency categories that could be compared with bottom-up, bank-by-bank results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">There is also a range of model-based results that could be produced and published.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">A simple exercise would be the equivalent of the bottom-up view using a static balance sheet assumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">At the other end of the spectrum, more comprehensive exercises could inform macroprudential analysis and incorporate amplification effects caused by interbank contagion or feedback loops between the real economy and the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Macroprudential stress testing This leads me to the second point I would like to emphasise today, the advantages of taking a macroprudential perspective with stress testing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The exercises coordinated by the EBA, using the constrained bottom-up approach, are microprudential in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">They aim to assess individual banks’ resilience to adverse financial and economic circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">They inform and help determine bank-specific capital requirements, in particular the components of Pillar 2 capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But it is also possible to carry out a macroprudential exercise that instead focuses on the system-wide impact of adverse shocks on the banking sector as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Macroprudential stress testing is characterised by a number of key elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, it applies a top-down perspective to model the impact of a stress scenario on banks and the wider economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">A top-down approach helps ensure that all banks in the system are treated impartially and consistently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This approach is necessary in macroprudential stress tests to be able to model the aggregate implications of banks’ dynamic responses to stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Second, macroprudential stress tests operate under the assumption of dynamic balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This enables the model to account for any amplification effects that banks’ reactions to the initial shock may entail at the aggregate level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.39,0)">As an example, we estimate that the responses of banks to the adverse scenario in the 2018 stress test would exacerbate the fall in GDP by a further 1.6% beyond the initial shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.23,0)">That deeper economic contraction would itself further deplete banks’ capital, something that would not be picked up under the static assumptions of the microprudential exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Third, macroprudential stress testing typically aims to capture a comprehensive view of systemic risks affecting the banking sector and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Just as microprudential stress tests can help banks improve their internal risk management processes, macroprudential exercises provide benefits to supervisors and regulators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Developing the models and infrastructure for these tests enables supervisors and regulators to analyse a range of scenarios, helping them to better understand the links between banks, other parts of the financial sector and the wider economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">This also means that they are able to see how the banking sector reacts to a number of alternative macroprudential policy paths, helping them to ensure that the macroprudential measures currently in place remain appropriate and adequate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">There are benefits, too, from carrying out both microprudential and macroprudential exercises simultaneously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">A combined exercise would help banks, market participants and regulators to assess the system-wide consequences of banks’ reactions to situations of stress, which would complement the information retrieved from the microprudential stress tests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">With that in mind, it may well be worth regularly publishing the results of the top-down macroprudential stress tests, possibly alongside the results of the microprudential exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">This simultaneous publication would provide all stakeholders with a more solid and comprehensive overview of the banking sector’s resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Over the past decade, system-wide stress tests have been established as an important tool for monitoring financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">They promote transparency in the banking sector, improve market discipline, foster banks’ own risk management capacity and, importantly, inform prudential decisions of both a microprudential and macroprudential nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The way stress tests are implemented has evolved since the financial crisis, and we continue to discuss the long-term strategy for their use with stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Our experiences have shown the additional benefits of supervisors including a top-down view in their discussions, and of considering the wider, macroprudential dimensions of stress testing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">ECB Banking Supervision uses both the qualitative results   and the quantitative results   as input for the SREP, to inform the setting of Pillar 2 capital requirements and Pillar 2 capital guidance, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For empirical evidence of the “gaming” behaviour
