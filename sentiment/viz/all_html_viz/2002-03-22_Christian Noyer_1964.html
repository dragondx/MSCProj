    <h3> Speaker: Christian Noyer </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)"> France, Europe, the euro and the ECB Speech by C. Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, University of Nantes, 22 March 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing my pleasure at being invited here to talk about the euro, the ECB and the single monetary policy in the first three years of Stage Three of European Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The primary objective of the ECB The Treaty establishing the European Community assigned to the single monetary policy the maintenance of price stability in the euro area as its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.5,0)">Monetary policy can only pursue one primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The participating national central banks have long held the belief, resulting from years of experience, that it is with the credible and lasting maintenance of price stability that the single monetary policy can best contribute to sustained long-run economic growth, employment creation and better standards of living.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.34,0)">Asking monetary policy to do more, or to serve other purposes, risks creating illusions about what monetary policy can do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.92,0)">The events of the 1970s, in particular, demonstrated that when a central bank aims at boosting real activity by implementing an excessively expansionary monetary policy, it faces higher inflation and risks of financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.71,0)">Due to the need for a disinflation process afterwards, the long-run disadvantages of such an expansionary policy in terms of output and employment losses turn out always to be much higher than the immediate advantages in terms of the transitory growth push.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Price stability, on the contrary, contributes to the efficient allocation of the economy's resources by enhancing the transparency of the price mechanism and by preventing both tax distortions and an individual misallocation of savings and wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Moreover, by neutralising the need to hedge against inflation and in particular by minimising the inflation risk premium in long-term interest rates, price stability contributes to the channelling of real resources towards production and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Thus it favours economic and employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">For the purposes of supporting and safeguarding the pursuit of price stability, the Treaty has endowed the ECB with a high degree of institutional independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.83,0)">At the same time, to ensure transparency and accountability in the ECB's policy design and implementation, the Treaty has also imposed certain reporting requirements on the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The ECB has, in fact, exceeded these, thereby setting very high standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.22,0)">Monetary policy decisions are regularly explained in the press conference given by the President and myself after the first meeting of the ECB Governing Council every month, in the Monthly Bulletin of the ECB, in the speeches given by members of the Governing Council and in the testimonies of the President and other Board members to the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Key aspects of the ECB's monetary policy strategy To achieve its Treaty mandate, the ECB has designed a medium term-oriented monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">To enhance clarity, to anchor expectations and to offer a yardstick against which the ECB can be held accountable, the Governing Council of the ECB provided a numerical definition of price stability as "a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is very close to the objectives of most participating national central banks before the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.4,0)">The Banque de France, for example, in 1998 had defined price stability as consumer price inflation "not exceeding 2%".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">The Governing Council also emphasised that price stability has to be maintained over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">The focus on the medium term guarantees that an appropriate orientation be imparted to monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This ensures measured policy reactions to the threats to price stability and prevents unnecessary volatility being introduced into the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The medium-term orientation also realistically acknowledges that short-term volatility in prices cannot be controlled by monetary policy and that monetary policy should therefore only be held accountable for price developments over a longer horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The recognition that monetary policy has to cope with an ever changing and imperfectly known world has been a key consideration in the design of the ECB's monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The Governing Council chose to equip itself with a broad but robust framework for analysing economic developments and shocks, which we call the two pillars of our of monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Given the long-term monetary nature of inflation, the first pillar assigns a prominent role to money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This implies the use of monetary analyses and of models in which monetary aggregates play an important role in analysing risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In parallel, the second pillar ensures that other forms of analysis and models, such as the investigation of the interplay between supply and demand as well as cost-push dynamics, are incorporated into the analysis of price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Together, the two pillars ensure a comprehensive assessment of the economic situation and allow a focus on the nature of the shocks hitting the euro area, thereby providing adequate guidance to the policy process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Can one size fit all?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The ECB's definition of price stability should be seen as a quantification of the ECB's primary objective, which applies to the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This implies that for the single monetary policy to be considered successful in fulfilling its primary objective only aggregate developments matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The euro area countries need not and will not always exhibit similar price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In the same way as the maintenance of price stability within a single country is consistent with divergences in the rate of price change among different regions and cities, price stability in the euro area is generally in line with inflation differentials among individual member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Indeed, studies of price differentials between major US cities show that these differentials are at least as large and sometimes even larger than between countries of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.05,0)">Whether such differentials are a cause for concern depends on their source.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Inflation differentials which result from what in public debates is often quoted as "a catching-up process", as illustrated by the Balassa-Samuelson theory, should be seen as part of a normal process of adjustment consistent with a well-functioning economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.91,0)">Thus they are not a cause for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.29,0)">A catching-up process may start when the level of productivity – and thus of per capita income – of a country in the monetary union is   lower than the other participating economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">When some of its productive sectors, notably the traded goods sectors, become exposed to international competition, this country typically goes through a transitional, catching-up period when it may experience in the same sectors productivity growth faster than that attained by more mature participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This catching-up process may, in turn, lead to faster price increases if the productivity growth the country gained in tradables is not matched by a similar productivity growth in its non-tradable sectors, as wages in tradables and non-tradables tend to converge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">In the euro area, the impact of pure catching-up effects on the price level is likely to be minor as a substantial process of convergence in per capita income has already taken place over the last few decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.82,0)">However, when inflation differentials arise from excessive wage increases, unsustainable expansion of profit margins or an expansionary stance in fiscal policy, the situation may become a cause for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.8,0)">Each of these factors, in fact, may well lead to losses in competitiveness and, eventually, to losses in output and employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.97,0)">These are, however, problems that the single monetary policy is not in a position to address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.82,0)">It is the task of national economic policies to avoid and to counteract such situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.28,0)">I will come back to these issues later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.89,0)">Inflation differentials may also be induced by economic or policy shocks which affect the euro area countries and regions in different ways and at different times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.76,0)">Also, local economies may respond dissimilarly to a common shock because of their individual economic structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">Especially in the run-up to Stage Three of EMU, the quantitative relevance of asymmetric shocks has attracted a lot of attention both among analysts and among economic observers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.2,0)">The economic framework they had in mind, known as the optimum currency area theory, predicts that the creation of a common monetary area becomes more costly the more the participating countries experience idiosyncratic shocks, in terms of size, nature and frequency, and the more varied their responses to such shocks are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">While asymmetric shocks and adjustment mechanisms have to be recognised as realities, they also have to be seen in a more general framework, within which all gains from Stage Three of EMU are taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">These gains are sizeable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">From a political point of view, monetary unification, as part of a more general process of European integration, should be seen as bringing long-lasting peace and a higher level of co-operation between participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">From an economic point of view, monetary unification should be seen as bringing greater prosperity and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">There is no doubt in fact that Stage Three of EMU has, and will have, a net positive impact on France and all other participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is, however, worth examining its potential effects resulting from asymmetries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.47,0)">To what extent do these asymmetries still exist and are they a concern?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">One useful way of approaching this problem is to compare the euro area with the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The US appears to be a fairly natural benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Its economy is similar in several ways to that of the euro area, not least in the size of its economy and population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">One line suggested by this approach is to compare the degree of synchronisation of economic activity among euro area countries with that of US states or regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">One interesting finding that emerges from the empirical literature is that asynchronous fluctuations also take place in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We therefore should not be surprised to observe a similar fact in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">However, the evidence resulting from several studies carried out in the past few years points unambiguously to a higher degree of co-movement in the US than in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Yet, most studies have also found a high and increasing degree of synchronisation within the euro area, not only over a longer period of time, but also in more recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This degree of convergence appears to be approaching the levels recorded in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Similar conclusions can be reached with reference to analyses which estimate the differentiated impact of asymmetric shocks and the resulting adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">These findings appear to contrast with the more diversified production structure of several euro area countries compared with that of states in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">However, this evidence is the result of the combination of two factors: the distribution of shocks and the resulting country-specific adjustment processes to the shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The relative impact of these two forces across countries in Europe is unclear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.35,0)">In addition to this evidence, it can been argued that analysing the evolution of the euro area economies only over the years preceding monetary union in order to gain insights into likely future developments can be misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Indeed, their entry into a currency union may well have fostered economic integration, enhanced intra-area trade and, with the increased interdependence, raised the degree of synchronisation of the participating countries' macroeconomic fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.94,0)">In addition, the adoption of the same currency eliminated one source of major external instability which affected euro area economies in the past, namely exchange rate shocks of significant magnitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Moreover, higher synchronisation will follow from closer trade links.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The adoption of a common currency, in fact, promotes trade among members of the Union by eliminating exchange rate risk and diminishing transaction costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">In theory, an increase in trade among two or more countries could also have the opposite effect, which is to increase the divergence of business cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This could happen, for instance, if closer integration and trade induce a higher degree of specialisation, with the consequence that production structures will become more heterogeneous across countries, making them more vulnerable to idiosyncratic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The question of which effect prevails is mainly an empirical one, as both are plausible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The evidence for the euro area so far appears to suggest that the more countries are integrated and the more they trade with each other, the more correlated the respective business cycles will be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">At the present stage, it is too early to estimate the effect of Stage Three of EMU on reducing the severity of asymmetric shocks and on increasing business cycle synchronisation among participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.21,0)">While this impact is likely to be taking place already, the period of time needed for its full effect to develop is very uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Although useful lessons can be gained from a comparison with the US, these should not be over-emphasised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As a matter of fact, some important differences between the euro area and the US can also be identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In the US, for example, the importance of stock markets is higher, and these markets can represent a mechanism amplifying the impact of shocks in the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Moreover, evidence has been found that in the US the adjustment to asymmetric shocks is faster than in the euro area, largely because of the latter's lower mobility of capital and labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.89,0)">In particular, labour mobility, which is one of the most important adjustment mechanisms in the US, is often found to be much lower in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">While this is partly offset by the increased mobility of capital, which has been enhanced by the creation of the Single Market in Europe, in many euro area countries labour still remains too immobile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.3,0)">A currency union needs flexible markets When labour mobility is low, the efficient response to economic shocks having asymmetrical effects on euro area countries requires prompt adjustments in prices and wages at local levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Flexibility in price and wage setting is therefore particularly crucial for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">More precisely, an increased flexibility would allow regions or national economies to adjust more rapidly and smoothly to shocks affecting particular sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">We should always bear in mind, moreover, that our economies operate in an increasingly competitive global environment requiring ever more frequent adjustments, particularly in some sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">For these and many other reasons, structural reforms aimed at increasing mobility, boosting competition and reducing rigidities and distortions in goods, service and labour markets are needed in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In product markets, some progress has been made over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">These markets have become more integrated and some sectors, such as the network industries, are being liberalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The adoption of the European Company Statute by the Council of Ministers, for example, is a step in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This Statute allows for, and regulates, the creation of firms operating on an EU-wide basis and being governed by Community law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Another ambitious reform is the liberalisation of the EU's postal sector, although its full implementation will take time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.11,0)">Despite these and other encouraging developments, the pace of liberalisation has been uneven across participating countries and more efforts are still needed as several sectors in various areas remain burdened by excessive regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.38,0)">These delays act as a brake on the flexibility and competition that is required to improve the long-term sustainable employment and growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.0,0)">One area still requiring much attention, as I already mentioned, is the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The potential benefits, in terms of higher aggregate welfare and employment growth, of reforming euro area labour markets are high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Following the reforms implemented in the 1990s, positive effects can already be felt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.99,0)">These include the stronger employment growth and the sharp decline in unemployment rates recorded in the euro area in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.66,0)">Progress with labour market structural reforms has, however, been very uneven among euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Indeed, rigidities persist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.08,0)">For example, although the euro area unemployment rate in 2001 stood at 8.5%, survey studies show that companies often had problems in recruiting workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Such labour mismatches demonstrate that more reforms are needed not only to increase labour supply and demand and improve job creation, but also to increase the likelihood that vacancies be filled and the unemployed find work more quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.56,0)">In addition, an unemployment rate still above 8%, low levels of labour force participation and uneven labour market performances across euro area countries clearly indicate that further measures need to be taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Reforms, in particular, are required to improve job intermediation, to enhance wage flexibility and increase wage differentiation, to improve education and to promote training and life-long learning in order to maintain and develop human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Moreover, reforms of the tax and benefit systems, the introduction of less restrictive employment protection, working time flexibility, and measures to increase labour mobility are also needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">It is also important to keep in mind that these reforms should be carried out in a broader, more systematic and co-ordinated manner across sectors and countries than at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">If the objective is to transform the euro area into the most competitive and dynamic economy in the world, as was decided at the Lisbon European Council in 2000, more efforts are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Challenges for fiscal policy I would now like to devote my attention to fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">National fiscal policies in Europe are guided by the budgetary provisions contained in the Maastricht Treaty and in the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The provisions in the Maastricht Treaty, which limit the levels of government deficit and government debt, have been key to achieving sounder public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The Stability and Growth Pact, agreed upon in 1997, introduced the target of a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus as a medium-term objective for Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">With monetary policy being conducted for the euro area as a whole, fiscal policy can be an important instrument in the hands of national governments to stabilise domestic demand and output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Disciplined and sound fiscal policies support the ECB's stability-oriented policy by reducing risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The so-called automatic stabilisers are one mechanism which can cushion fluctuations in demand and price developments at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Automatic fiscal stabilisers are mechanisms built into tax codes and social legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">They lead to a timely and symmetrical reaction of the budget policies to economic fluctuations by reducing demand pressures in an economy during periods of strong growth and by supporting the economy in downturns, without requiring further government action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The full benefits of automatic stabilisers can however only be secured if countries preserve the sustainability of public finances through prudent fiscal positions and low debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.8,0)">Otherwise, the burden of debt servicing and the risk of excessive deficits limit their ability to let the automatic stabilisers operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The strategy of attaining and preserving a medium-term position close to balance or in surplus, as required by the Stability and Growth Pact, promotes sustainable public finances and therefore also fully supports the stabilising role of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.93,0)">Nevertheless, there are considerable doubts about the effectiveness of discretionary fiscal fine-tuning as a way to manage aggregate demand due to the well-know implementation lags and problems of policy reversal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me finally add a few thoughts on the relationship between monetary policy and fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The ECB closely monitors fiscal policy since this is one of the main areas where significant shocks to price stability – and also to long-term interest rates – can originate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.34,0)">In fact, many episodes of high inflation in the past were related to a mismanagement of public finances combined with a very accommodating monetary stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Monetary policy is geared to maintaining price stability over the medium term and to this end it takes fiscal developments into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The ECB's monetary policy framework however does not envisage any mechanistic reaction to fiscal policy changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Moreover, there is no further need to co-ordinate monetary and fiscal policy at euro-area level if all authorities act within the clear, medium-term-oriented policy framework set out in the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">As long as participating countries comply with the objectives of this European fiscal framework, their budgetary stance supports a stability-oriented common monetary policy and each of them has the fiscal instruments at its disposal to accommodate asymmetric cyclical fluctuations or temporary shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Some reflections on the first three years of the single monetary policy I will devote the rest of my speech to an overview of the ECB's experience in the first three years of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.32,0)">During this period, the single monetary policy has been challenged by, among other things, fluctuations in economic activity both inside and outside the euro area, by a depreciation of the exchange rate of the euro, and by strong oil and food price rises at various stages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Despite this, forecasters and financial markets have remained confident about the ability of the ECB to achieve its primary objective over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Surveys on long-term inflation expectations and inflation expectations as embedded in long-term interest rates have invariably been in line with our objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The launch of the euro three years ago and the euro cash changeover this year are two other indisputable achievements of the ECB and its single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">The changeover was a challenge of unprecedented dimensions and its success went far beyond our own expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">People in the euro area have been enthusiastic about the currency since the very beginning of the cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The euro's arrival in 1999 brought about fundamental changes in the way governments, financial institutions and the private sector operate in the financial markets in the euro area and the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Within the euro area, the elimination of exchange rate risks and the lower transaction costs which followed, together with the much more transparent marketplace the euro has brought with it, have been creating new opportunities for business and driven firms towards higher levels of efficiency and competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The euro has also acted as a catalyst in the process of financial integration by widening and deepening the euro area financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">A large, liquid and integrated money market rapidly came into being after 1 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This in turn triggered a considerable growth in interest rate instruments denominated in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">On the unsecured money market, the EONIA reference interest rate, which is an interbank overnight rate index collected by the ECB, has established itself as one of the most important, or even the most important, reference rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The EONIA swap market is now considered the largest overnight swap market in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Also in the bond market, the euro played a crucial role in fostering the deeper and more liquid euro area bond market that we see today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">At international level, the euro has become the no.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">2 currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">It is the second most widely used reserve currency after the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.02,0)">The gap between the two currencies is wide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Experience shows, however, that there is a considerable
