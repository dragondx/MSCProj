    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.71,0)"> From boom to bust: towards a new equilibrium in bank credit Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Ernst & Young Business School seminar, Milan, 29 January 2010 Introduction   There is now a broad consensus that the period leading up to the crisis was characterised by excessive credit growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.79,0)">When the bubble burst, it resulted in the most pernicious banking crisis since the Second World War, accompanied by a severe economic recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In order to revert to a more balanced and sustainable management of credit, while safeguarding the role that credit plays in stimulating growth, new rules, regulations and incentives for financial market participants are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This is what the regulatory authorities and governments of all major industrial countries and developing countries are working towards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.96,0)">This is not the end of the issue, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Once the objective of establishing a new “steady state” has been identified, the path towards achieving this objective must be carved out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.82,0)">This will not be easy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.55,0)">If the adjustment is too swift, it could result in an over-adjustment of credit flows, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.13,0)">be too restrictive, giving rise to recessionary effects on the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.12,0)">If the adjustment is too slow, however, it could encourage a return to past behaviour, which led to excessive risk-taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Today I would like to examine the issues relating to the role of the banking sector in supplying credit flows, in terms of the following three phases: the pre-crisis state of imbalance, the new long-term steady state, and the period of transition leading up to said steady state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">The banking system during the credit boom years As with all system-wide banking crises, the recent turmoil was preceded by strong credit growth, combined with a speculative asset price bubble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.97,0)">This is confirmed by various credit indicators, such as the deviation of the credit-to-GDP ratio from its trend, detrended global credit growth  , the credit growth gap, and other indicators  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">For example, the global credit-to-GDP ratio gap, an indicator of the risk of speculative bubbles, had exceeded its threshold in mid-2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Likewise, the credit growth gap and the investment-to-GDP ratio had been on a strong upward trend, signalling the turmoil to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.86,0)">Looking at the various market segments confirms the excessive ease with which banking credit had been obtained, for instance, the boom in lending to finance leveraged buyouts    .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Fast credit growth in the period leading up to the crisis took place against a background of high capital ratios  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.8,0)">This was likely driven by four main factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.15,0)">First, a large share of the credit granted by large banks, in particular, was shifted off-balance sheet via securitisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Second, non-banks   also contributed to the credit flow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Third, the high profitability of banks contributed to the bolstering of their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.9,0)">Finally, most banks, particularly those in the United States, were operating under the Basel I regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Increasing risks, therefore, were not fully reflected in minimum capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.94,0)">The flow of credit, apart from being “excessive”, was in part also channelled to insufficiently productive uses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.2,0)">There was excessive leverage in some sectors, which contributed to the misalignment of underlying asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">For example, between 2003 and mid-2007, corporate loans to construction and real estate activities constituted almost 60% of total flows of loans to non-financial corporations in the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.65,0)">The easy flow of credit to the housing sector contributed to the overheating of property markets in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.21,0)">When the crisis set in, the declines in credit were most pronounced in countries such as Spain, Ireland, Belgium and Greece, which had been experiencing double-digit credit growth rates during the lead‑up to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.6,0)">Banking credit developments prior to the crisis were excessive owing to a combination of three factors: 1) financial innovation; 2) insufficient supervision, and 3) a highly accommodating monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let’s take a quick look at these factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The significant advances in financial innovation over the last decade fuelled the idea that asset liquidity had increased and that there was a greater potential for risk diversification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.67,0)">This idea proved, in part, to be an illusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.19,0)">When the crisis erupted, the presumed liquidity of these assets disappeared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.43,0)">Banks’ balance sheets were thereby clogged by illiquid assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.81,0)">The growing role of infrastructure for clearing and settling OTC trades – non-standardised and predominantly bilateral – created uncertainty regarding the distribution of exposures among the various counterparties, fuelling their mutual distrust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Another factor that helped create the perception of greater liquidity was the increased funding available from wholesale financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Moreover, the originate-to-distribute model was adopted not only by large institutions but also by others, such as Northern Rock, which were not equipped to deal with funding sources considerably more volatile than traditional sources, such as deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.66,0)">Recourse to wholesale markets contributed to exacerbating credit pro-cyclicality, with more abundant credit in periods favourable to markets but also greater vulnerability in the case of tighter markets conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.95,0)">This problem is not new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.5,0)">The crisis affecting savings and loan undertakings in the United States also originated in the differing maturities of bank assets and liabilities, which gave rise to risky activities in the junk bond and derivatives markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Securitisation played a role in creating cheaper and abundant credit, providing banks with additional funding sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.74,0)">These developments posed unprecedented and significant challenges for supervisory and regulatory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.15,0)">Although, in some cases, the growing risks and vulnerabilities were identified at the aggregate level, there was insufficient information to understand the interconnections that had been created in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.36,0)">Furthermore, risk assessments mainly targeted market participants’ behaviour rather than formulating concrete ways to intervene.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This reflected the micro-prudential approach of existing legislation, which mainly focused on individual financial institutions, without taking account of interconnections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">Let me also briefly mention monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">A wide-ranging discussion is currently under way about the role that keeping interest rates at low levels for a prolonged period has played in fostering the supply of bank credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">According to some research, there is no correlation between the level of interest rates and bank credit, in particular real estate lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Other recent studies suggest the opposite, providing evidence of several transmission channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.54,0)">First, the low level of interest rates may affect valuations, incomes and cash flows, which, in turn, can modify the way in which banks measure the expected risks associated with lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.44,0)">Second, low returns on comparable so-called risk-free securities, such as government bonds, prompt banks, asset managers and insurance companies to take on more risk and invest in assets offering higher returns, particularly if the performance of managers is measured on the basis of nominal yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Finally, low interest rates facilitate leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.2,0)">Overall, although, from an empirical standpoint further analysis is needed, it is difficult to reject the view that the policy of low interest rates contributed to the steady credit dynamics in the period preceding the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Certainly, this is a theme that should be studied further in the economic literature in the next few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The new steady state Given that the financial crisis has demonstrated the excesses in credit developments in the past, it is necessary to identify a new, sustainable equilibrium point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">To reach this steady state, important measures are needed in various areas, many of which are already in process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I will obviously not go into all of them, given the extent of the work in progress, but I will mention a few initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">First of all, the regulation of the banking system must be reviewed, with new rules constraining its assets and balance sheet structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">In December 2009, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced a reform package aiming to strengthen global capital and liquidity regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Capital requirements will be more stringent, thanks to the improved quality, consistency and transparency of the regulatory capital base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Proposals include a counter-cyclical capital buffer, and measures to promote provisioning over the cycle and to mitigate the possible excess cyclicality arising from the minimum capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Measures concerning the role of external ratings and the treatment of securitisation have also been announced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Better risk coverage is also needed, which is capable of capturing major on and off-balance sheet risks and derivative-related exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Various proposals have been formulated in this regard, including: strengthening the capital requirements for counterparty credit risk exposures arising from derivatives, repos and securities financing activities; a leverage requirement   to put a cap on the level of leverage in the banking sector; and internationally harmonised global liquidity standards, including a liquidity coverage ratio and a structural ratio  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Finally, governance of financial institutions must be strengthened, for instance with regard to remuneration incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The regulatory community is well aware of the fact that the reform must be introduced in an ordered manner in order to ensure the resilience of the financial system as a whole, while also supporting economic growth over the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The proposals are currently the subject of extensive consultations with the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">In addition, an impact study will be conducted to assess the implications of the various measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Based on the outcome thereof, the aim is to arrive, by the end of 2010, at an appropriate calibration for the new requirements in terms of the level and quality of capital, in order to find a balance between financial innovation, financial stability and sustainable economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">The Basel reform will be phased in gradually as financial conditions improve and the economic recovery strengthens, with the aim of implementation by the end of 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Appropriate grandfathering arrangements will be put in place in order to ensure a smooth transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">A further point highlighted by the crisis is the availability of resolution schemes that allow for speedy and decisive interventions in the event of bank failures or near-failures, averting deposit runs and limiting contagion effects on the wider banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Several initiatives in this area are under way both at the European and global levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">As regards derivatives, the aim is to increase transparency and risk management, especially through the creation of market infrastructures to centralise transaction settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Another area in which more stringent requirements are to be imposed is that of securitisation and credit derivatives activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">During the crisis, there was a strong decrease in securitisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">For this segment of the market to experience a broad recovery, fundamental changes towards more transparency, standardisation and simplicity are required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">There are various initiatives, both public and private, targeting this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The ECB is taking measures in order to gradually align the collateral eligibility criteria and risk control measures with best market standards and investors’ requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">In the context of the regulatory reform, the international community has committed itself to reducing the moral hazard posed by systemically important financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">A number of proposals are being discussed with international bodies, in particular the Basel Committee and the Financial Stability Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The debate recently gained momentum following the President of the United States’ proposal to adopt the “  These proposals have still not been detailed in depth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Nonetheless, on the basis of what has been made public, I am of the view that the initiative is heading in the right direction and represents the first step to ensuring the financial system can effectively support the real economy and is not weakened by the most volatile market fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.19,0)">It is, however, not the final step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Above all, it should not be a substitute for two other lines of action, which, in my opinion, are essential for a complete reform of the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The first is that the whole financial system should be subject to regulation, even if the specific regulations may vary according to the activities or institutions to which they apply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">However, I do not want the separation between traditional banking activities and high-risk proprietary trading operations to drive the latter to be undertaken by sectors or institutions that are less vigilant or are outside the sphere of regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.32,0)">My concerns arise from the fact that, while during the first G20 summit meetings, there was widespread consensus on the necessity of ensuring that no segments of the financial system are left outside the scope of the regulatory framework, over time, this resolve has dwindled and attention has mainly been focused on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Given the interconnectedness of markets, it is essential that investment banks, hedge funds and other institutions are also subject to adequate regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In particular, the supervisory authorities must have adequate information on the activities of these institutions in order to be able to evaluate vulnerabilities and possible contagion effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">The second line of action relates to the strengthening of the supervisory authorities, beginning with their independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Only institutions independent not only of political authorities but also of market participants can have the clarity and the power to take measures to reduce the cyclicality of credit and financial activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.4,0)">There are, therefore, concerns regarding the developments in the current debate in the United States, where the most independent institution, namely the Federal Reserve, is subject to attacks and pressures from various corners, including legislative initiatives aiming to curtail its powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">A final concern regarding international cooperation is this: there is no doubt that the “  Recent work shows that price stability is necessary, but not sufficient to ensure a homogenous flow of credit to the economy and avoid financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.59,0)">In particular, if monetary policy concentrates solely on inflation objectives, it might, in some circumstances, end up being too accommodative of credit cycles and fuel speculative bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.54,0)">Such a risk tends to become more apparent when interest rates are kept at a very low level for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.9,0)">On the other hand, it appears to be a difficult task for a central bank to use one instrument, such as interest rates, to achieve two objectives at the same time, namely price stability and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This is the reason why central banks should also be equipped with macro-prudential instruments, distinct from monetary policy, which can be used in order to avoid the excessive pro-cyclicality of credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">These instruments should enhance the stability and resilience of the banking sector over the business cycle, as well as the sustainability of the balance sheet structures of borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">A more efficient allocation of credit should result, thus helping to avoid the build-up of financial imbalances and contributing to improved economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">To sum up this part, the new steady state will be characterised by higher capital ratios and lower leverage in the banking sector, and probably also less recourse by the banking system to market financing in general, and to securitisation in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This will allow for more stable credit growth, which is less subject to pro-cyclicality, especially that deriving from supply factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Credit growth will also be less affected by financial market volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.38,0)">The transition The transition from the old equilibrium, which was really one of imbalance, to a new, more sustainable one cannot be instant, as that would involve an excessive adjustment with potentially recessionary effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Nor can it take too long as this would risk creating incentives to return to the unsatisfactory behaviour exhibited prior to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.56,0)">Defining the transition phases is possibly the most difficult challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The transition is characterised not only by the lag between decisions relating to new prudential regulations and their application, of which I spoke earlier, but also by the extraordinary measures in terms of monetary and financial policy, adopted by governments and central banks to combat the recession and support the financial system in facing the systemic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The major central banks have promptly and forcefully responded to the crisis with a broad variety of measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The classical prescription by Walter Bagehot, which describes central banks as lenders of last resort, has proven to be as valid today as it was 137 years ago when “Lombard Street” was first published.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Accommodating the sudden increase in the demand for liquidity prevented a disorderly de-leveraging process, prevented illiquid but solvent banks from going bust, and, more broadly, sustained confidence in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.23,0)">The steps taken by central banks have taken them into, up to now, uncharted territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.17,0)">Interest rates have been reduced to very low levels by historical standards, clearing the way for significantly lower bank interest rates  , thus supporting credit demand from households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">At the same time, non-conventional measures have been adopted with the aim of bringing abnormally high money market spreads down and ensuring a proper transmission of the monetary policy impulse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">These exceptional measures have had important effects on macroeconomic and financial stability, and improved the overall conditions on financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In particular, they have helped to “liquefy” assets that could otherwise have caused the insolvency of many financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">More generally, they have helped to restore confidence by reducing uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">In addition, they have prevented contagion effects that can arise in the financial system as a result of the inter-connectedness between various market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The monetary policy intervention also helped to restore the profitability of banks as the fall in short-term interest rates steepened the yield curve, to the benefit of the banking system, which usually funds itself in the short term in order to provide credit for longer terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This profitability also helped to support the flow of credit to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Financial measures have also been adopted, such as increased deposit insurance, guarantees for bank liabilities, and injections of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In addition, fiscal budgets have supported aggregate demand via automatic stabilisers and expansionary measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.81,0)">Over the last few months, leverage has generally fallen, especially among those institutions that were most highly leveraged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">The fall reflects, in part, recapitalisation efforts, lower risk-taking as a result of more prudent lending standards, and the shedding of assets and/or limitation of the growth in balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.58,0)">It also reflects pressure from the market and supervisory authorities to control leverage, as well as expectations regarding the possible introduction of a leverage ratio, in addition to risk-based capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">,   Likewise, capital position ratios of large and complex banking groups in the euro area are improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.05,0)">The earnings of these banks have recovered, while the growth of total assets and of risk-weighted assets has slowed down and capital has increased, both from public and private sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">These developments were necessary in view of the expected increase in non-performing loans as a delayed result of the economic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.45,0)">With improving conditions in the economy and financial markets, supportive measures by governments and central banks have progressively less “raison d’être”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.78,0)">The withdrawal of these measures must occur in a timely fashion; being too early or too late could have unwanted implications for the speed at which the new steady state can be reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.86,0)">In particular, too brisk a phasing-out could lead to a dramatic process of de-leveraging, jeopardising the economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.9,0)">On the other hand, it is essential to prevent the banking system from relying on support measures for too long, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">becoming “addicted” to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">The intermediation role of the central banks during the crisis, if drawn out for too long, may reduce incentives for banks to return to actively operating in the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.62,0)">Such a scenario may also weaken incentives to restructure banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Credit flows to households and firms represent an indicator of financing conditions and of the prospects of a recovery in economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">However, they also reflect supply and demand factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">On the whole, developments in credit appear to have been, up to now, in line with historical regularities, according to which loans to firms typically lag the economic cycle by a couple of quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In fact, credit flows remained positive, even during the period of the most severe contraction in economic activity, presumably as a result of the growing use of credit lines and revolving credit facilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.51,0)">Therefore, lending to firms can be expected to remain subdued even in the early stages of economic recovery, but it cannot be ruled out that supply factors will continue to restrict credit for some months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The flow of loans to households began to grow again at the end of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.38,0)">The quarterly survey on bank lending indicates that the degree of tightening adopted by banks for the granting of credit to firms declined over the last few months of 2009, but remain positive  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.67,0)">It is interesting to note that among the factors that affect banks’ restrictive intentions, neither the one concerning the liquidity position of the banks themselves nor the one concerning access to financial markets seems significant any longer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Both factors now contribute in a positive way to the intentions of banks to grant credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.94,0)">Considerations relating to the prospects for economic growth and those linked to specific sectors of the economy remain restrictive, but the degree of restriction is declining sharply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.18,0)">The element that marks a growing concern with regard to restrictiveness relates to the capital of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Clearly, the considerations in respect of the need to replenish capital are starting to exert a strong influence on the decisions of banks to grant new credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.92,0)">This dynamic is worrying.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.55,0)">It indicates that the banking system is interpreting the new regulations restrictively for credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.83,0)">This approach is undesirable and out of line with the objectives so far followed by the economic policy authorities of supporting the financial system, not as an end in itself but as an essential function of savings intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.85,0)">The outcry surrounding the effects that future capital standards and risk management – the so-called “Basel 3” – will have on credit developments in the short term seems unjustified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">The new rules are specifically intended to ensure a more orderly and sustainable flow of credit, not a reduction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Moreover, as I said earlier, a gradual process of adaptation to the new requirements is foreseen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The new capital requirements may be attained in two different ways, although they have opposite effects on banking activities: reduction in banking activities, particularly in credit to firms, on the one hand, and capital increase on the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The alarm that seems to be widespread in the banking sector concerning the new rules seems to mask the intention of adapting to them via a reduced exposure to the real economy, rather than via a capital increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This reaction seems to reflect the incentive of managers and shareholders to favour remuneration on equity and human capital, rather than long-term investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.01,0)">This is not in line with the macroeconomic objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">This is why we insist that the profits made in these months by the banking sector – which were obtained thanks to the interventions by the policy authorities to keep the system going, and thus ultimately by the taxpayers – should be used to increase the capital rather than to reward the banks’ managers and shareholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This applies not only to banks that have received direct assistance through guarantees and public capital injections, but also to the indirect benefits obtained as a result of low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.5,0)">Conclusion The pre-crisis period was marked by unsustainable credit policies by the banks and, more generally, by the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.17,0)">These policies were encouraged by inadequate supervision and slack prudential regulation, and also by the excessive influence the financial system had on regulatory mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.11,0)">This caused the biggest crisis of the post-war period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">We must find a new equilibrium in which the financial system truly supports the real economy, encouraging a flow of balanced credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The adjustment may not be immediate and it needs to follow a gradual path in order to arrive, in due course, at a new point of balance that allows a restoration of confidence not only among investors but also taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.7,0)">Everyone must play his or her part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The regulatory authorities have to agree quickly on the new system parameters, in consultation with the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Macroeconomic policy must promote conditions for a gradual adjustment, in line with the objective of sustaining economic growth and the restoration of a financial market that efficiently performs its primary role as an intermediary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.8,0)">Market players must understand that the future cannot be a simple return to the past, to the pre-crisis situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.33,0)">If we fail to reach the new equilibrium in due course we will have wasted not only the crisis but also the resources of taxpayers that have been used to save the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.15,0)">This can only backfire on the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.1,0)">Figure 1 Changes in credit standards applied to the approval of
