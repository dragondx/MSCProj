    <h1> The role of monetary policy in economic policy </h1>
    <h2> Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, to the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities Brussels, 3 December 1998 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)"> The role of monetary policy in economic policy Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, to the Economic and Social Committee of the European Communities Brussels, 3 December 1998 Ladies and gentlemen, in less than one month's time Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union   will start and the euro will be launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This event will have wide-reaching implications for the orientation of economic policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Moreover, the creation of a single currency is also likely to have a significant effect on the role of Europe in the international economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.55,0)">As with any fundamental change, the start of Stage Three will be characterised by considerable uncertainty and the European System of Central Banks   will not have an established track record.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Therefore, it is particularly important to explain to the public as clearly as possible both our objective of price stability and the framework or monetary policy strategy that we shall use to achieve our main goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I shall consider the role of monetary policy in economic policy in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The ESCB's monetary policy strategy The Treaty establishing the European Community   assigns to the ESCB the overriding objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">This mandate reflects the conviction that price stability is a key condition for creating a stability-oriented environment which is beneficial to economic activity, employment and, more generally, to the welfare of society, thereby contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As you will be aware, the Treaty also stipulates that the ESCB shall be independent in the performance of its tasks and duties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The reason for including this provision in the Treaty is that an independent central bank may be more effective in the pursuit of price stability - which is, in essence, a long-run commitment - without being pressured by the political authorities to achieve short-run objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In a democratic society, this gives rise to special requirements in terms of accountability and transparency, which are issues to which I shall return presently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The Governing Council of the European Central Bank   has carefully considered how these requirements could be fulfilled most effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">One of the key results of these deliberations was the recent decision to announce a quantitative definition of price stability by which the ESCB's performance can be easily assessed by the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Price stability was therefore specified as a "year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.03,0)">The term "increase", in particular, implies that a situation of deflation - i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.06,0)">a sustained and ongoing decline in the consumer price level - is not consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Price stability is a medium-term concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.0,0)">The ESCB will not smooth any short-term deviations in price developments from this quantitative perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.68,0)">As monetary policy measures affect the economy with long and unpredictable time lags, it is not feasible for central banks to control prices in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Moreover, the benefits of price stability pertain more to the long-run development of the price index than to its short-term fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In addition to the definition of price stability, the monetary policy strategy of the ESCB consists of two key elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">As a first pillar, the Governing Council attributed a "prominent role" to money, as the empirical evidence suggests that inflation is essentially a monetary phenomenon in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">For this reason, the Governing Council decided to announce a reference value for money growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The first reference value was recently determined at 4.5% and refers to the broad monetary aggregate M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This should allow for an adequate provision of money to the economy at a rate consistent with the achievement of sustainable non-inflationary economic growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The choice of this reference value was also determined by reasons other than the empirical relationship between broad money growth and inflation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Money growth will provide a reference value for assessing the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Indeed, money can help the general public to understand correctly what monetary policy can and cannot do, thereby enhancing the central bank's transparency and accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">While money will have a prominent role, it will not be the sole and automatic guide for the monetary policy of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Especially at the start of Stage Three, when significant and mostly unpredictable changes are likely to occur in the economic, monetary and financial environment, there will be a need to monitor a wide range of indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.78,0)">For example, the changeover to Stage Three may lead members of the public to adjust their investment portfolios and this could make the behaviour of monetary aggregates more difficult to explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.81,0)">Moreover, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding future price-setting behaviour in the euro area, especially in those Member States with more limited experience of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.06,0)">This might also blur the relationship between money and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The evaluation of the economic and financial indicators that will be monitored will be based exclusively on their expected influence on future price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.87,0)">For instance, the ESCB will follow closely long-term interest rates, confidence indicators, output measures, the behaviour of wages, the price of commodities and also the external value of the euro insofar as it affects prices in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The benefits of price stability I should now like to elaborate a little on the benefits of price stability, before moving on to the role of monetary policy in economic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">I have already highlighted the importance of price stability in shaping a stability-oriented macroeconomic context in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Indeed, the empirical evidence suggests that price developments are more predictable when the inflation rate is low; price stability thus enhances the predictability of the macroeconomic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">A situation of low inflation also allows households and firms to base their economic decisions on more reliable information, as they may find it easier to distinguish movements in relative prices from movements in the general price index.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Both of these aspects of price stability lead ultimately to a more efficient allocation of resources, which is of vital importance for the economic welfare of society in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.01,0)">For instance, firms may engage in long-term investments without fearing that an unexpected surge or decline in the inflation rate could cause their commitment to be sub-optimal or even unsustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the same vein, households may plan an optimal allocation of saving and consumption over their lifetime, without facing the risk of the real value of financial assets changing on account of an unexpected rise or decline in the inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">This enables financial markets to function more smoothly and perform more effectively their basic function of channelling funds to their most productive use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">One particular benefit to be derived from a stable price environment is that borrowers are not requested to pay extra, to cover the risk of an unexpected rise in the general price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.47,0)">As a consequence, real interest rates, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">interest rates corrected for expected inflation, will be lower, thereby encouraging people to commit more resources to productive activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.74,0)">A situation of price stability also avoids the risk of borrowers being confronted with a rising real value of financial debts, which are normally fixed in advance in nominal terms, in the event of an unexpected and persistent decline in prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.13,0)">Such a rising real debt burden may have negative effects on real economic activity, as borrowers are normally more engaged in productive activities than lenders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.93,0)">High inflation or persistent deflation is costly for society even in the best possible scenario, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">when it is perfectly anticipated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.93,0)">The need to take price level changes into account in every kind of nominal contract is so universal that extensive resources are ultimately diverted from alternative and more productive uses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.37,0)">For example, at times of high inflation sellers must continuously update menus and households expend needless time and energy when they are forced to economise on liquid balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Moreover, if the tax system is not completely indexed to changes in the price index, which is very often the case, inflation does in the end have real redistribution effects, which, in practice, entails an automatic increase in the tax burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Finally, I should like to emphasise the fact that price stability is particularly beneficial for the political cohesion of society, because inflation   brings about an undemocratic redistribution of economic resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.15,0)">Experience has shown that, as a rule, this hits the weakest members of society the hardest, because, for example, they maintain a higher proportion of their wealth in liquid assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">What the monetary policy of the ESCB can do The Treaty states that the ESCB, while having price stability as a primary objective, shall support the general economic policies in the European Community; moreover, it will operate in a such a way as to be consistent with the establishment of free and competitive markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The Treaty therefore provides an explicit order of priority for the objectives: price stability is the first reference point for the monetary policy of the ESCB, and only within the limits of price stability can there be scope to contribute to the achievement of the other objectives of the European Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As a consequence, the role of other Community objectives in the monetary policy of the ESCB is conditional upon the achievement of the overriding target of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.5,0)">The high unemployment rate in Europe represents the main concern of economic policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">I should like to stress that the ESCB shares these concerns and will do its utmost to help find a solution to this problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">That said, however, we should realise that what monetary policy is able to contribute to economic policy and the reduction of unemployment, is the achievement of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I have already explained the benefits of price stability for society and the reasons which underlie this conviction in some detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">By creating optimal conditions for a sustainable and strong pace of economic activity, price stability will ultimately spur employment growth and foster higher living standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Moreover, in specific circumstances, if production, inflation and employment all move in the same direction, monetary policy can play a role in stabilising output and employment growth, without endangering price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.56,0)">However, this role is very limited, because the high unemployment rate in Europe is far more the consequence of structural rigidities within the European labour and product markets than a result of adverse cyclical developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The solution is thus to be found, above all, in structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">The European unemployment rate has, indeed, been high and stable over the business cycles in the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">However, over the same period, unemployment was significantly reduced in those EU countries which succeeded in creating better-functioning labour and product markets, which allowed wages and prices to adjust when economic conditions changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">A clear example can be found in the Netherlands, where a substantial reduction in unemployment has been effected in recent years by reforming the labour market, while following the same monetary policy as Germany, where the unemployment rate is still close to 10%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.8,0)">The ESCB is also concerned with the variability of real output and the associated fluctuations in employment, which could be considered to be an undesired consequence of an excessive control of price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In this respect, the medium-term orientation of the monetary policy of the ESCB should help to avoid excessive fluctuations in real economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Given the fact that the ESCB does not aim to stabilise every short-term deviation of price developments from the predetermined path of price stability, it contributes to the stabilisation of economic activity around its long-run potential growth path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">I should like to add, however, that the room for manoeuvre of monetary policy and the degree of success in terms of maintaining price stability crucially depend on the support of sound fiscal policies and responsible wage settlements in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.91,0)">The links with other economic policies I should now like to address the way in which the economic environment and the economic policies of both the Community and the governments of Member States will affect the functioning of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.43,0)">A monetary policy reaction to inflationary pressures and the uprooting of inflationary expectations may cause short-run fluctuations in real output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Flexible and competitive goods and labour markets, however, would soften this trade-off, thereby allowing central banks to attain the goal of price stability with less serious adverse consequences for real output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The establishment of free and competitive markets for labour, goods and services would facilitate to a large extent the functioning of monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">At the limit, it is conceivable that if markets were to operate without friction, the control of inflation by a central bank could be exercised with a negligible impact on real output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Market flexibility may also help to reduce regional asymmetries in the effects of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.76,0)">The monetary policy of the ESCB will be geared towards the euro area as a whole and will not be able to take into account purely national or regional developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Moreover, the cyclical positions of participating countries will not completely converge at the start of Stage Three, although, with the single currency in place, some national differences may disappear over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.17,0)">In the past, asymmetric shocks across European countries were sometimes dealt with via movements in the exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In the EMU environment, which is characterised by a single and uniform monetary policy aimed at maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole, the required adjustments will have to stem from fiscal policies and national prices and wages, in addition to mobility of labour and capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">For this reason, the ESCB will follow closely, and contribute to, the debate on the reform of European wage-setting mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.68,0)">Sound economic reasoning recommends that wages should reflect the differentials in productivity; otherwise inflation and unemployment could result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Budgetary policies also play a major role in conditioning monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Sound budgetary policies enhance the credibility of monetary policy by preventing inflationary pressures due to an excessive stimulation of domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.66,0)">Furthermore, fiscal discipline exerts a downward influence on the risk premia embedded in nominal long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.84,0)">Moreover, given the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact, a budgetary position which is close to balance or in surplus in normal conditions may allow scope for reaction to unforeseen regional or local shocks that could bring about heavy real output losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">This would also contribute to alleviating the possible asymmetric impact of monetary policy actions on single countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Accountability and transparency of the monetary policy of the ESCB Allow me now to return to the issues of democratic accountability and transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The Treaty contains several provisions which ensure the accountability of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.47,0)">First, it states that the ECB is required to disclose to the European Community institutions   an annual report on the ESCB's monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Moreover, as President of the ECB, I am required to present the report to the European Parliament and to take part in the subsequent debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">As I have announced before, I shall attend the hearings at the European Parliament at least four times per year to discuss the activities of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The Parliament has the right to ask the members of the Executive Board to provide answers to specific questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Finally, representatives of the European Commission and of the ECOFIN Council participate in the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB and thus monitor the preparation of monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Broadly speaking, the issue of the transparency of monetary policy is very important at the start of Stage Three, given that the ESCB is a new institution and the public is not accustomed to evaluating its behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The monetary policy of the ESCB will be transparent in fulfilling its overriding objective of maintaining price stability, as stated explicitly in the mandate of the Treaty; it will also be held accountable in reaching its main goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The ESCB has also gone beyond the Treaty requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Since the summer, a routine of holding a monthly press conference has been established, in which I and the Vice-President of the ECB report on the decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB and disclose and explain the underlying arguments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">My introductory statements at these press conferences are and will continue to be published without delay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Moreover, as from January 1999 the ECB will provide the public with a Monthly Bulletin containing a detailed analysis of the economic situation that led to the monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Furthermore, my colleagues on the Executive Board of the ECB and myself intend to be very active in giving speeches which deal with all issues of relevance for the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">I am convinced that the Governors of the national central banks will be glad to perform the same role for national audiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Furthermore, the publication of working and occasional paper series will further clarify the "economic model" that underpins the ESCB's reasoning and behaviour and stimulate the debate on relevant technical and policy issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.64,0)">I should also like to emphasise that the ESCB does not see communication as a one-way street.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">On the contrary, I think that we would greatly benefit from a frequent exchange of opinions and ideas with social partners and the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Relationship with other European Community institutions The relationship between the ESCB and other European institutions is explicitly mentioned in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">There is considerable scope for collaboration and exchange of views with other European institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">However, the ESCB is independent in its pursuit of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">I have already mentioned my reports to the European Parliament, which represent an example of the democratic accountability of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Furthermore, as President of the ECB, I shall be invited to the ECOFIN Council meetings whenever issues of relevance to the ESCB come under discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.75,0)">As I mentioned earlier the President of the ECOFIN-Council and a member of the Commission may participate, without having the right to vote, in meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Finally, I should like to mention that I am also invited to the newly established informal Euro-11 Council meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Conclusion The main contribution of EMU to the welfare of the people will be the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Our conviction and hope is that the economic performance of the euro area will benefit significantly from price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">This will also ultimately facilitate the achievement of the objectives which underpin the general economic policies of the European Community and the individual governments at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Moreover, both the support of the social partners and the adoption of behaviour consistent with the maintenance of price stability are of extreme importance to a successful start of EMU.</span>
