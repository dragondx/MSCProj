    <h3> Speaker: Otmar Issing </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)"> The euro – a currency without a state Speech by Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBHelsinki, 24 March 2006 After more than seven years, the euro is firmly established as the currency of over 300 million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Its internal stability is evidenced by the fact that inflation has been steadily low from the very start, despite a sequence of negative price shocks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">As an international currency, the euro is second only to the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">At the same time, the euro represents a unique experience in history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">On the one hand, it is based on a clear supranational monetary order, whereby the European Central Bank has full sovereignty in conducting a single monetary policy for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.89,0)">On the other hand, political union is still limited and sovereignty remains predominantly national in many policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.63,0)">This asymmetry has raised questions about the sustainability of such an institutional arrangement since well before European Monetary Union started on 1 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">The “no” from the French and Dutch people on the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe triggered new interest in the prospects for Monetary Union and the future course of political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.39,0)">This happened despite the fact that the text of the European Constitution does not imply any changes to the role of the ECB, nor does it significantly affect the allocation of responsibilities in most other policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The continuous challenge for Europe has been to find the right balance between political, economic and monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.91,0)">This has been called the “triangle” between the state  , the market and the currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Economic integration took the lead In September 1946, Winston Churchill, in his memorable Zurich speech, called for the re-creation of the “European family”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This included the setting-up of a structure permitting Europe to live in peace, safety and freedom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Although political integration proved to be over-ambitious, some visionary political leaders decided, nevertheless, to pursue the path of economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This led to the founding of the European Coal and Steel Community in 1952 and the establishment of the European Economic Community with the Treaty of Rome in 1957.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The first step was a customs union among the six founding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">At the time, probably nobody could have guessed that economic integration would advance through various phases and over such a long period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But the Single European Act followed in 1986 and the “Single Market Programme” in 1992.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In short, the Single Market is now becoming a reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Work on the remaining imperfections of the Single Market is also advancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We must not forget that this process has required many decades and continuous political support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Why, in the last 50 years, did economic integration face fewer obstacles and actually keep in motion the process of European integration?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The main reason is that, from the outset, economic integration removed barriers and thereby secured material and economic benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In fact, it has brought widespread benefits by promoting reciprocal trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Trade in fact has grown by several multiples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Economic integration has also helped to establish a more competitive environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.54,0)">We must also not forget that economic integration has rendered all EU countries more interdependent than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.93,0)">Under these circumstances, spillovers from national policies could be significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Each country has a stake in the well-being and, let me say, “good behaviour” of its partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Given such circumstances, the conviction underlying the Maastricht Treaty was that nominal exchange rates should be irrevocably fixed to achieve and maintain a truly unified single European market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.01,0)">Without a single currency, it was felt that the achievements and deepening of the Single Market could be endangered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It was a political decision to launch European Economic and Monetary Union among a group of countries, which did not form a fully-fledged political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Taking stock, we may ask: was this move appropriate and well founded from an economic standpoint?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">For a moment, I want to go back to research on the economic arguments for – and against creating a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In the 1960s, a group of researchers – following the pioneering contributions of Mundell, Kenen and McKinnon started posing a crucial question: from a purely economic point of view, what is the optimal area for a single currency?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The Optimum Currency Area   theory that ensued is well-known to you all and I don’t have to say much about it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is not easy to summarise the many views on the euro area as an OCA, or to sum up the vast volume of empirical studies of all OCA criteria for European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The euro area may not yet be an optimum currency area in all respects to the extent that, for example, the United States is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">On the other hand, it scores quite highly under several OCA criteria – such as economic openness, diversification in production and consumption, degree of price stability, and several elements of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">In the areas where it scores less well – such as price and wage flexibility, and some facets of financial integration – remedies are being sought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.26,0)">How could EMU affect the optimality of the euro currency area over time?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Andrew Rose and Jeffrey Frankel offered an important new forward-looking perspective strengthening the OCA argument in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">By studying the effects of several currency unions that occurred in the past, they showed that monetary integration leads to a significant deepening of reciprocal trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The implication for EMU is that the euro area may turn into an optimum currency area after the launch of monetary integration, even if it was not an OCA before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In other words, to quote Rose and Frankel: “countries which join EMU, no matter what their motivation may be, may satisfy OCA properties ex-post even if they do not ex-ante!” This has been termed the “endogeneity of optimum currency area” effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Several authors have brought forward concepts similar to the above hypothesis of the “endogeneity of OCA”, but in areas other than trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Artis and Zhang have discussed the endogeneity of symmetry of shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Blanchard and Wolfers, and Saint Paul and Bentolila, have discussed the endogeneity of labour market institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.6,0)">Kalemli-Ozcan, Sørensen and Yosha discuss the effects of sharing a single currency on financial markets and insurance schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.62,0)">Therefore, there may be diverse sources of “endogeneities of OCA.” Such endogeneities can be seen as a set of processes triggered by the start of a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Hence, monetary union may help to set in motion forces bringing countries closer together, forces that were not present   before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.16,0)">To be fair, various other issues may arise in the years ahead that could render the verdict more complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Some authors, such as Krugman in his “Lessons from Massachusetts”, postulate a “concentration” hypothesis: the euro, together with stronger trade and financial ties, will result in greater specialisation of euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.75,0)">This may gradually intensify inter-industry trade, and cause each country to become more sensitive to industry-specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.31,0)">In turn, more idiosyncratic business cycles would result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.7,0)">Hence, if the forces of concentration prevail, euro area countries may witness more pronounced growth, employment and inflation differentials than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.7,0)">This could be a concern in view of the generally limited price and wage flexibility, low labour mobility and the lack of a risk-sharing mechanism due to the still incipient financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.96,0)">Time will judge the severity of this potential effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Montary Union With the completion of the Single Market and European Monetary Union the economic and the monetary side of the “triangle” have been completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This raises the fundamental question: Can monetary union work and survive without the third side of the triangle, which is without a fully-fledged political union?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The answer is clear: yes, it can.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">It is possible that, over the very long term, strong elements of a political union may   emerge, but for the time being Economic and Monetary Union   can proceed perfectly well without a political union in the form that we understand today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Here are the main arguments: First, Monetary Union in itself has a clear political dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It entails the transfer of national monetary policy decision-making powers to a supranational entity, the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Relinquishing national sovereignty in such an important field is a substantive contribution to political integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A central bank is, after all, an element of statehood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">The Maastricht Treaty has made the ECB independent of any political influence so that it is able to fulfil its clear mandate of preserving price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.8,0)">Monetary policy-making is hence not only centralised but also depoliticised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This step was only possible because euro area members had achieved a high degree of convergence in monetary policy attitudes and preferences in the run-up to Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Moreover, the way participating countries see themselves and their role as nation states has changed profoundly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">In this respect, the launch of the euro marks the most recent and far-reaching step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">National sovereignty has not only been transferred in the area of monetary and exchange rate policies but also in other key policy areas, such as competition and trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Finally, a single market has been established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">As a result, the euro area countries already share important elements of state formation which are also key to the functioning of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Flexibility Second, from a purely economic perspective, what else is needed to make the single monetary policy work?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Most importantly, flexible markets are needed to enhance the ability of individual countries to respond to specific circumstances and economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Wages and prices in particular may need to adapt more quickly and strongly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The mobility of capital will become an increasingly important adjustment mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In order for markets to be flexible and send the proper signals, policy-makers must ensure an institutional framework that sets the right incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Substantial progress has been made but a lot still needs to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.88,0)">In particular, labour market reforms are still lagging in many countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.24,0)">As a result, the ability of economies to adapt quickly and generate employment is still limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The Lisbon agenda, the “pro-employment and growth blueprint” for Europe, sets the right priorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">However, it needs to be implemented more forcefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">This would go a long way towards creating the dynamic and flexible environment that Europe needs, not only for the proper functioning of Monetary Union but also for the attainment of the growth and employment objectives of the Lisbon agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">The Stability and Growth Pact Sound fiscal policies are another prerequisite for Monetary Union to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">As sovereignty over fiscal policies remains at the national level, the EU member countries decided to introduce fiscal rules to help to prevent imprudent fiscal policies and their adverse effects on inflation and expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">These rules are enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and operationalised in the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In setting deficit and debt targets   and establishing procedures for budgetary surveillance and control, they are not fundamentally different from appropriate rules at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Compliance with the rules in Member States will keep deficits low enough to ensure government solvency while providing governments with the necessary room to smoothen economic fluctuations through the operation of automatic fiscal stabilisers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">This will also generate an appropriate fiscal environment for monetary policy-making at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The Growth and Stability Pact is a fundamental pillar of European Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Past problems with its implementation cannot be denied, but the recent reform of the Pact aims to remedy this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In order to foster fiscal discipline, the governments of the Member States, together with the Commission, now need to implement the revised rules in a rigorous and consistent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The current excessive deficit procedures, and above all the case of Germany as not only the largest economy but also the “source” of the Pact are the real test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In this way, confidence in the credibility of the rules and in prudent fiscal policies can be reinforced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.66,0)">This will not be an easy task, admittedly, and serious concerns have been expressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Sound fiscal policies will remain a priority for many years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.82,0)">The final stage What does all this imply for the future of Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Given the achievements of economic and political integration in Europe over the past 50 years, we should remain confident that we will also find answers to our current problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Many problems have emerged and been mastered, although solutions typically take time and rarely come overnight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Does that mean that we can trust only in our past record of achievement?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.26,0)">Obviously not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Current and future challenges will need to be addressed by the actions of current and future political leaders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">We will no doubt see new challenges and ongoing discussion and debate about the most appropriate policies and approaches to consolidate and extend the success of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.35,0)">However, to expect that such challenges and debates will threaten EMU is to underestimate the strength of European institutions, our willingness to make this project work and our ability to knock heads together when tough solutions are required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">On the final stage of the integration process, the steady state of political union in Europe, one can only speculate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">None of the examples of history, be they a federation of states or a union of nations, can serve as a blueprint for shaping political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The EU has always been, and will remain, a unique undertaking for which there are no models that can easily be adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">It is important to allow an evolutionary process, which is open to further steps of integration, yet safeguards what is already in place and working well, and which assigns competencies to nation states or even regions as appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">In fact, we have been in the midst of such a process for quite some time, and Monetary Union is and will remain one of its major success stories.</span>
