    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> Keeping cyber risk at bay: our individual and joint responsibility Introductory remarks by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the fifth meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures Frankfurt am Main, 16 December 2020 At the last meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures  , we were all in the same room at the ECB premises in Frankfurt am Main.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">That was on 27 February 2020, when we launched the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">We already knew this was a critical step in addressing cyber threats.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But we did not know just how timely it was.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.13,0)">Shortly after that meeting, the first wave of the coronavirus   pandemic led to strict containment measures across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.63,0)">While the upcoming vaccine roll-outs are a light at the end of the tunnel, mobility restrictions are likely to remain in place for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.51,0)">These restrictions have confronted us all with unparalleled challenges in our personal and professional lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">In response, the world has taken a giant leap forward in terms of digitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">And when the public health situation finally improves, we will not go back to the old normal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Working from home has become the norm for many of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We have adjusted our way of life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">And while we will certainly enjoy regaining our ability to move and interact freely, we will also learn lessons from the pandemic and see benefits from how we adapted to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The digital transformation is here to stay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">But for digitalisation to contribute to economic resilience beyond the pandemic, cyber resilience will be paramount.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Otherwise, digitalisation may increase risks rather than reduce them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Today I will argue that this applies to the financial sector in particular and I will discuss the necessary policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Digitalisation and the resilience of the financial sector: lessons from the pandemic Digitalisation is transforming financial services and consumers’ behaviour .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As our recently published study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area    shows, almost half of euro area adults now prefer to pay digitally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And the more Europe’s citizens rely on digital payment initiation – be it by card, credit transfer or direct debit – the more Europe’s businesses rely on the underlying financial infrastructures for the clearing and final settlement of these transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">The resilience of these infrastructures is of key importance to the functioning of Europe’s economy, especially during troubled times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Well-functioning financial infrastructures are also crucial to enabling the unprecedented measures that have been taken to stimulate Europe’s economy in response to the devastating effects of COVID-19.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This applies to emergency aid and recovery packages implemented at national level as well as to the ground-breaking decision to use EU borrowing to support the crisis response and stimulate the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The related financial flows can only be channelled to their beneficiaries through stable and reliable trading, clearing and settlement infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">One thing is clear: the operational resilience – and with it the cyber resilience – of financial entities and of our financial system as a whole is just as important as their financial resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Safeguarding the cyber resilience of financial services: building the European lines of defence To safeguard the cyber resilience of financial services, the EU can build on three lines of defence: regulation and oversight, cyber resilience testing, and intelligence sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The European Commission’s proposal for a Digital Operational Resilience Act   In September this year, the European Commission launched its proposal for a Digital Operational Resilience Act , now commonly referred to as DORA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">As indicated by the Commission, EU financial services legislation since the financial crisis has focused to a large extent on financial risks associated with financial services, while it has not fully addressed the digital operational resilience of the entities offering these services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">DORA is therefore a welcome initiative: it provides a unique opportunity to address the current fragmentation in financial legislation and supervisory approaches in the field of digital operational resilience, including cyber resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">DORA incorporates the lessons that have been learned from the Eurosystem’s cyber resilience strategy for financial market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It covers – implicitly or explicitly – the Eurosystem’s cyber resilience oversight expectations, the European programme to test and improve the resilience of the financial sector against sophisticated cyber-attacks  , and the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative created by the ECRB  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We will hear more from the European Commission today on DORA, including how it contributes to the Commission’s wider digital finance package .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Testing cyber resilience: the TIBER-EU framework While cyber risk is a form of operational risk, it has its own unique characteristics, namely the speed and scale at which it can spread and the intent and perseverance of threat actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The best way to demonstrate cyber resilience is to test it in a way that mimics a real-life attack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">That is what the TIBER-EU framework is about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">TIBER-EU is currently implemented in ten European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Some of the participants in this meeting have already gone through a TIBER-EU test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The Netherlands and Denmark have drawn the main findings from the first wave of tests performed on Dutch and Danish core financial entities and I look forward to learning more about them today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Sharing intelligence: the Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative The objective of the ECRB is to foster trust and collaboration between pan-European financial market infrastructures and critical service providers on the one hand, and between both of these groups and the relevant authorities on the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The ECRB also aims to encourage joint initiatives whose goal is to increase the cyber resilience capabilities of the financial sector and to reinforce its operational resilience more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Trust, collaboration and joint initiatives form the bedrock of the ECRB’s Cyber Information and Intelligence Sharing Initiative   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">In February this year, we launched this initiative and committed to implementing it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Today we will hear about the progress achieved so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">For the CIISI-EU to be a success and contribute to the stability of Europe’s financial system, we need to make sure not only that all building blocks are in place, but also that we actively share cyber information and intelligence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.31,0)">Conclusion We want to avoid a situation where a cyber incident affecting financial infrastructures could evolve into a systemic financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.45,0)">Assessing whether or not this will happen hinges on identifying whether a cyber incident will escalate from the operational level to the financial level, and ultimately start damaging confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">So we must continue our efforts to prevent cyber incidents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.37,0)">And if they do occur in spite of our individual and collective efforts, we must make sure they do not escalate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">The work of the ECRB is instrumental here, as it encourages trust, cooperation and joint initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Cyber resilience is not a state, it is an ever-shifting aspiration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Improving our cyber resilience and staying ahead of our adversaries requires ceaseless efforts from all of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">We are all individually responsible, but we are all in it together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Panetta  , “Protecting the European
