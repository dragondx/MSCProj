    <span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)"> Global imbalances and the need for policy adjustment Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBEuroconference Miami, 25 April 2006 Thank you for your invitation to participate in “The euro and the dollar” conference organised by the Jean Monnet Chair of the European Union Studies of the University of Miami, in cooperation with the Miami-Florida European Union Center of Excellence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">It is for me an honour to address such a distinguished gathering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I am here today to talk about what seems to be the most popular topic among economic commentators and policy-makers with an international interest: global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.69,0)">The interest in and attention given to global imbalances is not only proportional to the record size of the US current account deficit and the global implications of its unwinding, but also to the longevity of this debate, since the resilience of the US current account deficit has so far confounded the expectations of many economists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Today, I would like to take the opportunity to give a view from the other side of the Atlantic on global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In particular, I will touch upon three aspects:   the causes of global imbalances;   how worried we should be about global imbalances; and   the need for policy adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.96,0)">Bussière, M., M.
