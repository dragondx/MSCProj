    <span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)"> Challenges of financial integration in the post-FSAP period Contribution of Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB to High level panel: "Where next?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Discussion on remaining challenges for financial integration" at EC Conference on European financial integration: Progress and prospects, Brussels, 23 June 2004 I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">INTRODUCTION Before sharing with you my thoughts on the policy challenges on our way to a truly single financial market, it may be useful – precisely because those challenges are daunting – to remind ourselves of the basic motivation for the European project of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Indeed, financial integration is not an end in itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Instead, it is a crucial prerequisite for the development and the competitiveness of the European financial sector, and of the European economy more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">By stimulating greater competition and increasing the breadth and depth of financial markets, it contributes to greater market liquidity, reduced costs of capital, and a more efficient allocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Greater integration would therefore foster the performance of the European financial sector and enable markets and service providers to compete more effectively in the global marketplace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">At the same time, it would enable the EU corporate and household sectors to benefit from access to comparatively cheaper and higher quality financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Moreover, as numerous studies have shown, the greater economic efficiency achieved with financial market integration would ultimately foster a higher potential growth path of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Significant progress has already been made following the implementation of the Financial Services Action Plan  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It cannot be denied however that, unlike the market for manufactured goods where integration is a reality, the financial market has remained rather segmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.09,0)">Why has this been the case and what can we do about it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is the topic I would like to discuss today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">TWO LEGS TO WALK The building-up of the single financial market has relied on different institutional approaches over the years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A first approach, which remained in place until the mid-1980s, based the production of European legislation on two elements: the unanimity rule and the full harmonisation of rules and regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">This approach did not lead to meaningful integration, given the combination of a very far destination   with an almost immobile vehicle  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The second approach, still underway, is based on a different combination: first, as far as the vehicle is concerned, the majority rule in the legislative process; second, as far as the destination is concerned, the twin principles of minimum harmonisation and mutual recognition of regulatory standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This approach, without full legal harmonisation, was used to guide the advancement of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Indeed, it produced the first UCITS Directive   and the Second Banking Directive  , and has remained the basis for the single passport concept in financial services: the authorisation by the home Member State and the application of its law and regulations is valid for all Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The rationale underlying the “two legs” of minimum harmonisation and mutual recognition is that an environment of regulatory competition among Member States would foster at the same time the cross-border provision of services and an overall improvement, further harmonisation and lightening of regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">On the one hand, market participants would be allowed to operate across the EU to the widest extent possible on the basis of a single regulatory regime, as provided by their home country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">On the other hand, as integration progresses, Member States would have incentives to adjust their respective regulatory frameworks both to foster their own financial markets and to prevent excessive regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">A market-driven harmonisation would also eliminate regulatory barriers to market access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Ultimately, the emergence of a pan-European level playing-field was expected, leading to convergence of the costs of providing financial services across borders and to the EU-wide expansion of financial activities and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.37,0)">Reality has not been fully aligned with expectations so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">It is true that regulatory competition has worked and was effective to a certain extent in a first round of financial market integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The European passport undoubtedly helped to improve market access across Member States and to spur a process of regulatory convergence towards better, more market-friendly practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">However, these improvements did not translate into the supply to end-users of all types of financial products and services, nor did they produce a significant reduction of the regulatory burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.47,0)">On the way to a single financial market, market participants still find the obstacle of a patchwork of local regulatory and supervisory requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.89,0)">As a consequence, the costs of providing financial services across borders have remained higher than they could be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In this context we should also keep in mind that, despite the European passport, financial institutions still expand across borders mainly via the establishment of subsidiaries, rather than branches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is due to a variety of economic, historical and legal factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.54,0)">Because regulatory and supervisory regimes differ so widely across countries, the large majority of European financial groups with significant cross-border business have to comply with several sets of national rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And given the costs associated with this institutional set-up, it is not surprising that only a limited number of financial institutions are operating on a truly multinational basis, and even less can be considered pan-European actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">We should be aware that all the reports of the expert groups representing the various segments of the financial industry – which are being discussed at this conference – call for an improvement of the regulatory and supervisory environment for cross-border activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The key cause of this state of affairs is that only the first leg of the current approach, namely the minimum harmonisation of requirements, could move at a satisfactory pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The second leg, namely mutual recognition of national rules, has had a limited effect in stimulating a process towards sufficient regulatory and supervisory convergence because it was not really put to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.01,0)">This has not favoured the full development of the single financial market since if one leg does not move, the whole body cannot move.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Of course, not only the public sector, but also the private sector bears a responsibility for this development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In particular, the question could be raised whether the financial industry itself set the right incentives to persuade EU and national authorities to develop a more efficient system of mutual recognition, as has happened in the manufacturing sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Interestingly enough, the segments of the financial sector where a higher level of integration has been achieved – such as the unsecured interbank money market, and bond and government bond markets – are also those where the industry itself took the initiative to harmonise rules and practices, including product specification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">WHAT CROSS-BORDER BANKS NEED I believe that the current approach has been fully exploited with the completion of the FSAP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The measures adopted under the FSAP have substantially filled the legislative gaps at the EU level in the banking, insurance, securities and financial conglomerates fields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">The thrust of the existing EU body of directives is, and rightly so, to reinforce the mechanisms for home-country control and mutual recognition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.51,0)">Now, the stage in which the foremost priority was to complete the legislative framework has come to an end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.86,0)">No one can seriously claim that further financial integration is impeded by the lack of one or two directives in one or another field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">What we should do now is to turn towards the challenge of creating a lighter and more flexible regulatory structure and a more consistent and less burdensome implementation process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">This is what is needed to sustain a truly integrated financial sector and, ultimately, to support economic growth in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In the new stage of building the single financial market, we should therefore focus on the development of a common set of technical regulatory requirements, to which market participants can directly refer in their cross-border activities and which would be interpreted and enforced consistently by Member States’ authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">The so-called Lamfalussy approach, now extended to all the segments of the financial sector, has the potential to provide the basis for such a new stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">First, it provides the tool for developing a single EU rulebook for cross-border provision of financial services via the introduction of an enhanced concept of secondary Community legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Second, it also establishes the institutional setting for pursuing a greater convergence of implementation and enforcement practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Together, these two measures should reduce the costs of the cross-border provision of financial services substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">A SINGLE RULEBOOK The concept of the EU rulebook refers to a streamlined regulatory framework for financial institutions, which would be both more uniform and more flexible across Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.25,0)">Currently, the Community source of most financial legislation and regulation is often not even transparent to market players since they fully operate according to national rulebooks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Of course, the “interface” with market participants should remain based at the national level in accordance with the allocation of supervisory competencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">However, it would be immensely beneficial if the financial services industry would be in a position to refer directly to a homogeneous body of rules for their cross-border activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Moreover, this set of rules should be flexible enough to be easily updated in response to new market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The Lamfalussy approach was conceived for this purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It allows for an extended recourse to Community secondary legislation   which should span not only over the new FSAP legislation, but also over a large part both of existing Community Directives and national regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Implementing the approach in this way would imply, firstly, a real shift of legislation from Level 1 to Level The former should only entail essential principles, while the technical choices and solutions should be agreed on the basis of Level 2 measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">For instance, in the banking field, the forthcoming capital adequacy framework should be ideally written in such a way that the technical provisions are adopted as Level 2 measures, which could be amended without the need to change the text of the Level 1 measures as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Secondly, the development of the EU rulebook would also require a substantial shift from national rulebooks to Level 2 with regard to those parts that could be dealt with more appropriately by means of EU secondary legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">National regulations would then be geared towards complementing, rather than adapting or replicating, EU rules by means of specific provisions tailored to local financial business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Overall, this new approach would allow for a clear distinction between the three layers of the overall regulatory requirements market participants have to comply with:   common EU principles, laid down in Level 1;   common EU technical provisions, embodied in Level 2; and   national rules, reflecting specific features of local markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">This would favour the accountability of regulatory processes, alleviate the cost of compliance for financial institutions with cross-border business, and ensure a level playing-field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">V. CONSISTENT IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT Of course, the EU rulebook would only be effective if implemented and enforced consistently by the authorities in charge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">To this end, a considerable harmonisation effort for supervisory practices would be necessary, which should take place through the enhanced cooperation between competent authorities within the newly established supervisory committees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Cooperation at the EU level can help support convergence insofar as it develops transparent standards and agreed best practices to be followed in the implementation and enforcement of the EU rulebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Such convergence of supervisory practices may also involve a refinement of the home-country control and mutual recognition principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.43,0)">Thus far, these principles only apply to the direct provision of services and the establishment of branches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">However, given the emergence of very large cross-border financial groups in host markets in recent years, there are increasing demands for further rationalisation of the implementation and enforcement of financial regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">A financial group operating in several Member States should be able to organise reporting and compliance through a single integrated process rather than by establishing separate procedures for each country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">An option, currently under consideration in the banking field, is the extension of the concept of the consolidated supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.31,0)">10.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In sum, the design, implementation and enforcement of an EU rulebook should be pursued essentially through an ambitious application of Levels 2 and 3 of the new method.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Only the full use of these two components can, in my view, equip the single financial market with an effective regulatory and supervisory process, and hence make it competitive on a global scale, efficient, and truly supportive of the EU economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.57,0)">VI.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.47,0)">THE ROLE OF COMPETITION POLICY 11.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">A crucial condition for the development of pan-European marketplaces is a well-functioning cross-border competition process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.69,0)">First, there may be distortions of the competitive process stemming from the behaviour of private agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Marketplaces are still predominantly organised at the domestic level, which may entail that market participants wish to keep competitive advantages and rents, rather than engage in more intense competition in wider EU markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.58,0)">Second, public authorities may also set policies aimed at pursuing the legitimate interest of supporting their respective financial centres, which to some extent may unduly interfere with cross-border competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The result is that consolidation is often realised through complex group structures, with entities in all countries concerned and with an overlapping of jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Competition policy should thus be seen as central to the integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Barriers to entry and unequal treatment call for active policies at the EU level, which should complement the monitoring of the correct implementation of EU law at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Competition policy should therefore be seen as a tool to optimise the regulatory process and as an element for further work in the post-FSAP environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The aim should be to ensure that the broad FSAP objectives of furthering integration are not hindered by anti-competitive behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.01,0)">VII.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.76,0)">CONCLUSION 12.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Efforts in the post-FSAP period should be devoted to best implementing the new framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">If exploited ambitiously, the new framework could work effectively as a new foundation for the single financial market, within the current institutional setting based on the exercise of national competences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The central issue is the need to develop and enforce a genuine EU rulebook for cross-border financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Ultimately, this should allow market participants to organise themselves across the single financial market as they currently do in national markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">However, financial markets are moving very fast and progress along the lines I have described needs to be swift.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The challenge of these next steps should not be underestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.32,0)">I am sometimes concerned that the adjustment to the needs of more integrated markets occurs too slowly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For example, the Level 3 committees in banking and insurance, which have been just established, need to reach a steady state as early as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">It is also important to set up a monitoring framework to review and set in motion the progress to be made in the post-FSAP period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This framework, as the one provided for the monitoring of the FSAP itself, could include several components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Objectives and concrete targets should be spelled out, together with precise timetables and deadlines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">An independent structure, which also considers the views of the industry, could be responsible for the regular review of developments during the post-FSAP period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This would enhance the accountability and reliability of the whole process.</span>
