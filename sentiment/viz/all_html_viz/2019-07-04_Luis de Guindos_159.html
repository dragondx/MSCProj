    <h3> Speaker: Luis de Guindos </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)"> Macroprudential policy ten years after the crisis Keynote speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the CIRSF Annual International Conference 2019 “Financial Supervision and Financial Stability Ten Years after the Crisis: Achievements and Next Steps”, Lisbon, 4 July 2019 Since the financial crisis, the euro area’s institutional architecture has evolved significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Back in 2010, in the midst of the crisis, we created the predecessor of today’s European Stability Mechanism   to provide assistance to euro area countries experiencing or threatened by severe financing problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">At the same time, the European System of Financial Supervision was introduced, aimed at ensuring consistency and appropriate financial supervision in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It includes the European Banking Authority  , which provides harmonised prudential rules for financial institutions in the EU, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Since 2010, the European Systemic Risk Board   brings these institutions together with the national supervisory authorities and central banks to share their assessments on the financial system and devise consistent supervisory responses for the entire EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Since the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism in 2014, the ECB is the European banking supervisor and closely cooperates with the three European Supervisory Authorities, and especially with the EBA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Should banks fail, the Single Resolution Board ensures their orderly resolution with as little impact as possible on the real economy and public finances thanks also to the funds available from the Single Resolution Fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Only last month, the Eurogroup agreed to equip the Single Resolution Fund with a backstop financed by the ESM to further strengthen the European financial architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Looking beyond microprudential supervision, we have built up the macroprudential policy toolkit over the past ten years, to address risks of a systemic nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">National authorities and the ECB can deploy pre-emptive macroprudential tools to mitigate risk-taking and enhance the resilience of the financial system, while the ESRB can issue warnings and recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">In my remarks today, I will discuss the financial stability challenges facing the euro area and will focus on the relevance of countercyclical macroprudential policy to safeguarding financial stability and supporting prudent lending, by banks and non-banks, throughout the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">So far, macroprudential policies have focused on the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But the financial system is broader than that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Non-bank financial entities such as investment funds, insurance companies and pension funds also take on risks and can amplify the wider financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">So it is more important than ever that macroprudential policies are broadened to cover these non-bank financial entities as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.94,0)">Financial stability and macroprudential policy in the Economic and Monetary Union The euro area’s ongoing economic recovery faces renewed global headwinds that are weighing on the economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.34,0)">Uncertainties related to the rising threat of trade protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and geopolitical factors, including those related to Brexit, make the economic environment more challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">In this environment, the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy is necessary for inflation to remain on a sustained path towards levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.71,0)">At the same time, the environment indicates that risks to economic growth are tilted to the downside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">This reinforces the need to strengthen the balance sheets of our financial and non-financial firms to withstand any shocks that may occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Fortunately, banks have done exactly that over the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Capital ratios of euro area systemic banks increased from 10.4% at the end of 2010 to 14.3% by the end of last year  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This increase has been facilitated by the general recovery, supported by the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy, and is a reaction to increased market pressures and additional macroprudential requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Indeed, macroprudential policy aims to maintain a strong and stable financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">It has become a crucial complement to the ECB’s monetary policy which is geared towards achieving price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.48,0)">While the current accommodative monetary policy is supporting the economic recovery, it may generate undesired side effects in the form of excessive risk-taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Macroprudential policy can counter these excesses with its targeted toolkit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.41,0)">By imposing additional requirements, it can restrain lending to excessively risky borrowers or create the necessary loss absorption capacity in specific sectors or countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Institutional set-up of macroprudential policy within European banking supervision This more targeted application of macroprudential policy to individual countries is also reflected in its institutional set-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">National authorities are first in line to counter emerging systemic risk in a timely manner by deploying the available instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">They have detailed knowledge of their domestic banking systems and financial structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The ECB, in turn, complements the national authorities with its cross-country perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It can identify regulatory differences and counter potential inaction bias by the national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">To operate this two-tier set-up effectively, the SSM Regulation provides that national authorities must notify the ECB of macroprudential measures they intend to implement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The ECB’s Governing Council may object to these measures and, if deemed necessary, set higher macroprudential requirements than those set by national authorities, commonly known as “top-up”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The “top-up” option is considered a last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">There are two main reasons for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">First, national authorities being responsible for addressing financial imbalances creates a clear expectation that they do so in a timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">If national macroprudential authorities can act with a complete macroprudential toolkit to fulfil their mandates, the scope for the ECB to set higher requirements is more focussed to address risks from cross-country spillovers to secure a consistent application across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Second, macroprudential policy authorities, represented by national central banks and supervisors, come together at the ECB’s Financial Stability Committee  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The FSC serves as the central platform of exchange at the technical level for authorities to share their experience in financial stability and macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The Committee has achieved important milestones in increasing data coverage and quality, assessing systemic risk and developing calibration strategies for macroprudential instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This holds also true for those instruments that are not fully harmonised at EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.96,0)">For example, borrower-based measures such as loan-to-value, loan-to-income or debt service-to-income can limit the leverage of households and non-financial corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">These instruments are thought to be the most effective macroprudential instruments for curtailing excessively risky credit origination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Indeed, because of their effectiveness, 13 countries have already implemented measures targeting the specificities of their real estate markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.42,0)">Nevertheless, some euro area countries do not have the full legislation in place to deploy all borrower-based measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.87,0)">And even if they do, the institution that decides on borrower-based instruments is not always the central bank or the supervisory authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.6,0)">This creates an additional hurdle to deploying the best macroprudential policy responses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As a result, some macroprudential authorities use recommendations to the financial institutions as a second-best option.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Beyond the possibility of using borrower-based measures to address real estate risks, Belgium and Finland have increased the risk weights on banks’ mortgage exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">These measures focus on banks’ resilience to potential losses on their outstanding stock of mortgage loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.07,0)">Systemic risks may also arise from sources other than real estate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Therefore, national authorities have increased the combined buffer requirements, which include five different buffer types.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">First, the capital conservation buffer of 2.5% is applied to all banks to maintain capital in the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Second, to mitigate the “too-big-to-fail” problem, the buffer for global systemically important institutions is currently applied, in the range of 1-2%, to eight globally important banks in France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Third, buffers of up to 2% have been applied to more than 100 other   systemically important institutions across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Fourth, four countries are addressing structural risks by applying the systemic risk buffer either to individual institutions, in the case of Austria, the Netherlands and Slovakia, or at the country level in the case of Estonia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The fifth buffer is the countercyclical capital buffer  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">It is central to a countercyclical macroprudential policy as it helps ensure financial stability throughout the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">By raising capital requirements as imbalances are building up, it increases bank resilience well ahead of potential shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In a downturn, the CCyB can be released to give banks the necessary capital space to support lending to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">So far, seven euro area countries have announced that they will activate or increase CCyB rates of up to 1.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The ECB’s view is that banks’ overall capital levels are currently appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.25,0)">Nevertheless, the current buffer calibrations prevent them from being used countercyclically throughout the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.51,0)">The limited size of the CCyB calibrations restricts the possibility for releasing it to support lending to the real economy if the cycle turns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">As macroprudential authorities, we are therefore continuing to review the implementation and scope of the available instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">In this respect, we very much welcome last month’s publication of the new Capital Requirements Directive   and Capital Requirements Regulation   to strengthen the macroprudential toolkit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Role of the non-bank financial sector and macroprudential policy Despite the many achievements in the regulatory reform process since the crisis, there are areas where more work needs to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In my view, the regulatory framework for the non-bank financial sector is one of these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">First of all, the sector has grown significantly in size and importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.89,0)">Second, it is accumulating ever more risks on its balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.53,0)">And third, work on the macroprudential framework for this sector is still in its infancy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Let me start with the growing size of the sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In the euro area, total assets held by non-banks have almost doubled over the last ten years, growing from €23 trillion in 2008 to €42 trillion in 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.39,0)">While the size of the banking sector stagnated over this period, non-banks currently account for around 55% of the euro area financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The fast growth of non-banks reflects their increasing role in financing the euro area real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Whereas ten years ago, non-banks accounted for 14% of the euro area financial sector’s loans to non-financial corporations, they now account for twice that share.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Moreover, non-banks provide a steady net flow of financing to non-financial corporations through the purchase of debt securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In the ten years prior to the crisis, euro area non-financial corporations obtained only 10% of their credit by issuing debt securities, while this share increased to more than 50% in the decade after the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">By diversifying the financing sources of the real economy, the non-bank financial sector plays an important role in financial intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">It provides an additional source of financing and can ultimately help to smooth shocks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.87,0)">The growing relevance of non-bank intermediation can, however, create potential new vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.64,0)">In their search for higher yields, non-banks have accumulated more risks in their investment portfolios in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.53,0)">For instance, more than half of the bonds held by euro area investment funds are BBB-rated or lower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">For euro area insurers this share is somewhat smaller, at around 40%, but it has increased by more than 5 percentage points over the last five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Insurers have also been venturing into alternative asset classes such as alternative, infrastructure and private equity funds, loans and real estate holdings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Their exposure to these assets has reached almost 10% of total investment and is expected to rise further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.41,0)">As some of these assets are highly illiquid, the portfolio shift towards these assets may also increase insurers’ liquidity risk beyond credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.33,0)">But this is only one example, where the credit risk on non-banks’ balance sheets is coupled with liquidity risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.71,0)">In fact, liquidity risk is particularly an issue for some bond and equity funds that invest in less liquid assets, while offering short-term redemptions to their investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.4,0)">These funds are vulnerable to sudden changes in investor sentiment, so-called “run risks”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.78,0)">Some recent cases were a reminder that investors in less liquid funds might indeed run if they fear deterioration in asset quality or liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.98,0)">While recent instances happened in a generally stable market environment and did not have systemic repercussions, liquidity problems might have been larger in an adverse market environment and with many funds affected simultaneously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">If anything, the liquidity mismatches observed in bond and equity funds call for greater scrutiny of market practices and a possible review of the regulatory framework to ensure the sector’s resilience also in stressed market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.11,0)">More generally, through increased risk-taking and leverage, non-banks may currently be contributing to the cyclical under-pricing of risks and the amplification of asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.62,0)">If these risks were to unwind in a disorderly manner, this could lead to funding flows drying up and affect the funding conditions of the real economy more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Moreover, distress in the non-bank sector could spread to the banking sector as well, due to the strong links between the two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">For instance, euro area non-banks hold over one quarter of bonds and shares issued by euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I have argued in the past that, from a regulatory perspective, we need to establish at least two lines of defence for evolving risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">First and foremost, the non-bank financial sector needs to have solid prudential standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.04,0)">But this will not be sufficient if risks evolve more broadly and across institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">We will also need an extension of the macroprudential toolkit to the non-bank financial sector, in order to provide the authorities with the means to address risks at system level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">While the macroprudential framework for banks is relatively well developed and provides authorities with tools to address cyclical and structural systemic risks, the framework for non-banks is still in its infancy and needs to be further developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">There are substantial differences between banks and non-banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.77,0)">When we look at financial stability concerns in non-banks, we are looking less at the risk-bearing capacity of the individual institution’s balance sheet and more at the potential for contagion and shock amplification through the system and amplification of the broader financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">So the key risks that we look at relate to liquidity, leverage, procyclicality and interconnectedness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">A macroprudential framework for non-banks would need to identify and address the key fragilities and externalities stemming from the non-bank sector, and provide the appropriate tools for authorities to achieve this in an efficient and effective manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Such a framework should support the beneficial role that non-banks play in financial intermediation and ensure the sustainable development of non-bank financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">On a note of particular relevance in a monetary union, it would thereby help reap the full benefits of a deep and integrated European capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In this respect, the ECB continues to support the further development and deepening of EU capital markets through the capital markets union  , not least in the light of the approaching exit of the United Kingdom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.79,0)">The United Kingdom’s departure from the EU’s Single Market will, by its very nature, affect the shape of Europe’s future financial market architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Non-bank financing of the euro area economy is no exception to this, particularly given the substantial role played by London as a financial hub for European capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">Planning by the financial industry suggests that Brexit may result in a substantial relocation of activity to a number of different euro area countries, which may lead to a multi-centric European financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">In a financial system with a number of increasingly important hubs rather than one dominant centre in London, it will be more important than ever that these hubs can interact with one another efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This will require policies that foster the integration of EU capital markets by addressing barriers to integration and encouraging supervisory convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">So Brexit is both a challenge and an impetus to our pursuit of the ambitious plans laid out under the CMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The institutional architecture of the euro area has markedly strengthened in the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">With important new institutions, we have seen more robust supervision of financial institutions and the deployment of macroprudential instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This has contributed to strengthening our financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">But we still need to enhance the countercyclical use of our macroprudential instruments by providing adequate macroprudential space to support robust lending and the real economy throughout the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Equally, we urgently need to develop and, where appropriate, deploy the necessary macroprudential instruments for non-banks as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Finally, we must also pursue the ambitious plans laid out under the CMU to create a deep and integrated European capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">All of this will allow us to improve financial stability across the wide array of financial institutions and markets that make up the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.05,0)">Klaus Regling at press conference after Eurogroup meeting, Luxembourg, 14 June 2019:
