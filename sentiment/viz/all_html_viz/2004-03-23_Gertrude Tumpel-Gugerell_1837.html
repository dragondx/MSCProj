    <span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)"> Enlarged EU - Financial Strength and Weakness from a Global Perspective Central Bankers' Point of View Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBEuropean Banking & Financial Forum 2004, Prague, 23 March 2004 Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to speak to participate in this Forum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">In five weeks the European Union will welcome ten new members, the largest ever expansion in the history of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Today’s subject – the Financial Strength and Weakness of an enlarged European Union depends a larger degree on our ability to strengthen the growth potential in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The main motivation behind the decision on the Lisbon agenda few years ago was this unused potential of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.26,0)">To achieve the objectives requires change and reform in our economies or as the Austrian born economist Joseph A. Schumpeter put it: “economic progress means turmoil”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Growth results from technological in addition to capital accumulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Technological innovation results from entrepreneurial investments like R&D.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.37,0)">The incentive to engage in innovative investments is affected by the economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.87,0)">Statistics suggest that not only is Europe investing less in R&D, but also the efficiency with which the innovation is converted into usable output is lower in Europe compared to the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.83,0)">While in some EU member states the number of patents is about half that of the US, the EU average is only about a quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Further, R&D in Europe largely takes place in large mature firms, rather than in small start-ups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This has the implication that innovations in Europe tend to be developed in “old” industries, such as automotive, chemicals and engineering, where large mature firms already exist, rather than in “fresh” technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">A recent report to the European Commission highlights 5 factors which encourage R&D investment:   a system to protect industrial and intellectual property rights on innovations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">an education system conducive to the accumulation of frontier knowledge a stable macroeconomic environment, as R&D investments are long term and may require substantial periods of time to pay off flexible product and labour markets access to risk capital by new start-up firms Intellectual property rights and education are not really the issues a central bank feels competent, therefore I move to factor number 3, a stable macroeconomic environment: Central Banks have achieved a lot during the past decade – for the time being inflation is under control, this creates confidence, competitiveness, low risk premia and a low cost of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">This has been achieved in present and future member countries alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Sound fiscal policies allow room for investment and lower taxes in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Economic governance, in Europe, the way agreed objectives are pursued should be strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.12,0)">This concerns the Lisbon agenda as well as the SGP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Turning to growth factor number 4, flexibility of product markets, we see progress in liberalisation of network industries, such as telecommunications and utilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.71,0)">But much remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Strong competition and price pressures in communication and other high tech industries play a central role to facilitate productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Flexible labour markets are seen as a precondition for more growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Many steps have been taken, progress can be seen in labour market participation of women and older workers has increased in some member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Much more can be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Reforms in tax and social security systems are underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">A flexible labour market and high degree of fluctuation can be combined with social protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This is shown for example by Austria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Incentives to participate in the labour market and further qualifications are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Last but not least growth factor number 5, finance for growth: we have estimated that 1% more growth could be generated by developing financial markets throughout the EU to the level of the most advanced markets or to that of the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Financial development will reduce transaction costs, it will increase the marginal productivity of capital and it can influence households’ savings rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The introduction of the euro has broadened and deepened bond markets and integrated the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">With the exception of the new member countries and Ireland banking services are mostly offered by banks within national borders although the EU-wide single banking licence exists since 1992.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The bank based financial system has proved to be resilient during the recent economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">But what if equity contracts are superior in the context of financing new technologies?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It turns out that while new firms are created at equal rates on both sides of the Atlantic, start ups in Europe tend to be in less innovative   sectors and tend to be primarily bank financed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Overall venture capital financing is only about one-third in Europe relative to the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">While the useful role of banks in financing small firms should not be discounted, other, equity based forms of finance, may be needed to be further developed to fully exploit Europe’s growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.65,0)">There seems to be a fairly widespread consensus that at least in some European countries equity markets are “too small”, “too fragmented” or “underdeveloped.” I turn to this question next.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">We should not forget that the growth of equity markets in the EU has been substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.73,0)">In 1980, stock market capitalisation as a percentage of GDP was just 8 percent in continental Europe, while in the US and the UK the comparable figures were 38 percent and 46 percent, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">In 2000, in continental Europe this had increased to 105 percent of GDP  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Hence, while developments have been rapid, the level of equity market development in continental Europe remains significantly below that of Anglo-Saxon countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">First, the euro area is composed of independent national states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.12,0)">This implies that each country has different regulatory, legal and tax systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These differences act as barriers to a truly unified financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">These problems are for the most part well identified, even though solutions, due to the nature of the matter, require time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The Financial Services Action Plan drawn up by the EU Council in 1999 includes more than 20 legislative proposals, which are to be fully implemented by 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">A most recent example are the new harmonised rules on corporate take-overs, which are expected to create a more level playing field for cross-border corporate take-overs and enhance share holder rights and overall improve corporate governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Second, the European securities infrastructure today is highly fragmented with over 30 national exchanges and about 20 national clearing and settlement institutions in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">20 additional systems will join together with the accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">No other currency area has ever had to cope with a similar degree of fragmentation of its securities infrastructure, which is the result of the fact that the euro area has inherited the infrastructure of its member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Let me summarise the main points: I would see the main challenge for Europe in fostering its long term growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In my presentation I tried to concentrate on those fields which I consider as crucial for achieving this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The role of Central Banks is primarily to contribute to macroeconomic stability by providing a reliable investment framework for companies and by ensuring consumers that their purchasing power will not diminish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Structural reforms should be envisaged in order to shorten the reaction time of the economy to a change in the environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">More flexibility should, however, not come at the cost of social security – one of the advantages the European economy has compared to the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">One important element in fostering long term growth is to enhance investment in R&D activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">In this regard further development and integration of financial markets in Europe is warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">New and more flexible ways of financing start up firms and revolutionary business ideas have to be introduced – mainly by developing stock markets, encouraging venture capital and harmonising the legal framework for business financing in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">One of the fathers of today’s European Union, Jean Monnet, once said that “Men only accept change in a time of need – and they only see need in a crisis”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">I hope that in the context of an enlarged Europe we will introduce the necessary changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">I am very confident about that and I would like to encourage you to be an active part in this project.</span><span style="background-color:
