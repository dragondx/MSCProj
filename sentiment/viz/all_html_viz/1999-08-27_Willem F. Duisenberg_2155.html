    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)"> Economic and Monetary Union in Europe - the challenges ahead Speech by Professor Dr. L.H.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Hoogduin, on behalf of Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City on "New challenges for monetary policy" on 27 August 1999 in Jackson Hole, Wyoming From the European perspective, the title of this year's Jackson Hole symposium - "new challenges for monetary policy" - is particularly appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Economic and Monetary Union   in Europe is a unique project and its consummation with the introduction of the single monetary policy on 1 January 1999 took place less than eight months ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Today, given the time available, I will not endeavour to review all the challenges which are raised by EMU comprehensively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I shall have to be selective, largely focusing on the primary objective of the Eurosystem, which is to maintain price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In this context, let me briefly explain our terminology, which may perhaps not be known to everybody as yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The "Eurosystem" is the name we gave to the European Central Bank   and the currently eleven national central banks of those countries which have introduced the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The "euro area" comprises these eleven countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I should like to start with some observations on the objective and limitations of monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Owing to the successful process of disinflation and convergence within Europe over the past decade, the launch of the euro last January took place in an environment of price stability that few observers would have predicted only a few years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Consumers and firms are already reaping the benefits of this environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.19,0)">The relative price signals on which the efficiency of the market mechanism relies are not obscured by volatility in the general level of prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">By avoiding the costs and distortions inflation would impose on the economy, price stability is contributing to the growth and employment potential of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">This contribution is substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.64,0)">Unfortunately, it is all too easily taken for granted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.21,0)">Memories of the still recent past relating to the consequences of high and unstable inflation tend to fade rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">We are sometimes already hearing the argument that, given that price stability has been achieved, monetary policy should now be re-oriented away from its primary objective of price stability towards other goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.6,0)">One of the challenges facing the Eurosystem is to maintain the support of the broad public constituency necessary to resist these calls, which - as I hardly need to point out to such a distinguished audience of central bankers and monetary economists - are misguided and ultimately counter-productive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.08,0)">However, it can be said that the situation is the same as that in the world of sports; winning a championship and reaching the top is difficult, but staying there is even harder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">The institutional framework for European monetary policy, as created by the Maastricht Treaty   is well suited to meeting this challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Most importantly, the single monetary policy has been clearly assigned the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">To facilitate the achievement of this goal, the ECB and the national central banks have been accorded a high degree of institutional independence so as to protect monetary policy decisions from undue external interference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.4,0)">The Treaty imposes several duties and tasks on the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">However, there is no doubt that the objective of price stability is over-riding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">For example, the Treaty stipulates - if I may quote - that the Eurosystem "without prejudice to the objective of price stability, ... shall support the general economic policies in the Community, with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community", which include "sustainable and non-inflationary growth" and "a high level of employment".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Given the clear priority attached to the primary objective of price stability, how does the ECB address these other Treaty obligations?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me make three points in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">First, among economists and central bankers, there is overwhelming agreement that there is no long-run trade-off between real activity and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Attempting to use monetary policy to raise real economic activity above its sustainable level will, in the end, simply lead to ever higher inflation, but not to faster economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">I am convinced that the best contribution monetary policy can make to sustainable growth and employment in the euro area is to maintain price stability in a credible and lasting manner, allowing the considerable benefits of price stability to be reaped over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This is the economic rationale underlying the EC Treaty and the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.53,0)">Second, it is generally acknowledged that monetary policy does affect real activity in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Although the focus must always be on price stability, in many cases the policy action required to maintain price stability will also help sustain short-run economic and employment prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.63,0)">The reduction of the Eurosystem's main refinancing rate on 8 April was a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.5,0)">Following the Asian and Russian financial crises last year, global demand weakened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.1,0)">Weaker external demand led to a shift in the balance of risks to price stability in the euro area towards the downside, as demand pressures abated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">As monetary indicators did not signal inflationary risks at that time, the Governing Council of the ECB concluded that a cut of 50 basis points in the main refinancing rate best served the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">This lower level of interest rates may also be supportive of real activity and employment in the short-run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Our eyes must always be firmly focused on the goal, on our goal, to maintain price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.57,0)">Our monetary policy does not explicitly aim at influencing the business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">However, as said in many cases, the necessary monetary policy measures to achieve our goal also tend, almost automatically, to work in the right direction from a cyclical point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This leads me to my third point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In situations where monetary policy might face a short-term trade-off between adverse developments in real activity and deviations from price stability, the over-riding priority accorded to countering the latter must be made absolutely clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.64,0)">Any ambiguity on this point will simply endanger the credibility, and therefore the effectiveness, of the monetary policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.74,0)">This does not mean that the policy action must be draconian.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The medium-term orientation of the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy permits a gradualist and measured response to previously unforeseen threats to price stability, should this be regarded as appropriate, depending on the nature of the threat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Such gradualism may help to avoid the introduction of unnecessary uncertainty into the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Recognition and an understanding of these three central points are essential for the implementation of a successful monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Communicating both the objective and the limitations of monetary policy to the public is a vital issue to which I will return later in my remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.81,0)">But it would be remiss at this point if I did not address what is surely the greatest economic challenge facing the euro area at present, namely the unacceptably high level of unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.78,0)">There is a broad consensus that unemployment in the euro area is overwhelmingly structural in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.54,0)">Monetary policy cannot solve this problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">National governments bear the main responsibility for structural economic reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">In particular, further reforms of the tax and welfare systems are required in many EU countries in order to increase the incentives to create new jobs and to accept them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Wage moderation can also have a significant beneficial impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Monetary policy makes its best supportive contribution by providing the environment of price stability in which structural reforms can work most effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">It should be recognised that the implementation of EMU has made it even more urgent to improve the flexibility of labour and goods markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.68,0)">In this context, it would very likely be the wrong answer if governments were to try to create a "social union", harmonising social security systems and standards at a very high level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The ECB will continue to cajole governments into implementing necessary and long overdue reforms, but the final hard decisions - and I acknowledge that they are hard decisions, since the considerable benefits of structural reform often only become apparent with time - lie with the national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.28,0)">In those countries where appropriate structural reforms have been implemented and wage growth has been moderate, unemployment is either low by euro area standards or is falling more rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">These experiences offer important lessons for other countries in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Fortunately, a broader awareness of the necessity of structural reforms recently seems to be emerging in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Of course, ultimately only sustained action will count.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.27,0)">The cyclical recovery that is underway is no substitute for such action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Thus far, I have largely discussed the goal of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">How is this goal to be achieved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">At the heart of the answer to this question is the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The strategy has two closely related aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">First, the strategy must structure the monetary policy-making process in such a way that the Governing Council of the ECB is presented with the information and analysis required to take appropriate monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Second, the strategy must ensure that policy decisions, including the economic rationale on which they are based, can be presented in a clear and coherent way to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The communication policy as part of the strategy obviously has to be consistent with the structure of the internal decision-making process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In designing the Eurosystem's strategy, the Governing Council of the ECB recognised the new circumstances faced by monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.65,0)">Where there were previously eleven open, generally small economies, there is now one large, relatively closed single currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The challenges implied by this transformation in the landscape of monetary policy are profound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.18,0)">Relatively little is known as yet about the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in the euro area after the transition to Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">One important challenge for the Eurosystem is to obtain a better knowledge of the structure and functioning of the euro area economy and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy within it, so that policy actions can be implemented accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Together with experts in the national central banks, the ECB has embarked on an intensive programme of analysis and research into these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.51,0)">One obvious problem related to the fact that the euro area did not exist as a single currency area in the past regards the availability of statistical data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Compared with national central banks, we do not have the same amount of long historical time series of monetary and economic indicators, based on harmonised statistical concepts, at our disposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">However, we have already developed quite reliable estimates for a number of these historical series, and the quality and availability of current statistics on the euro area has increased significantly over the last few quarters, for example in the areas of money and banking and balance of payments statistics, but also across a wide range of economic statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This process of improving the quality and the availability of statistical data covering the euro area will continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.03,0)">It would have clearly been unwise for the ECB to develop a strategy which relies mechanically on the signals offered by a single indicator or forecast in order to take monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.53,0)">Indeed, such a simplistic approach to monetary policy-making is unwise in all circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.59,0)">Our knowledge of the structure of the euro area economy and the indicator properties of specific variables - although improving rapidly - is simply too limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The primary objective of monetary policy has been quantified with the publication of a definition of price stability, against which the Eurosystem can be held accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">This definition illustrates our aversion to both inflation and deflation, since it defines price stability as annual increases of below 2% in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">To maintain price stability according to this definition, monetary developments are closely monitored against a quantitative reference value for the broad benchmark aggregate, M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In parallel, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments in the euro area is undertaken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This assessment encompasses a wide range of indicator variables, including inflation projections produced both inside and outside the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Using all this information, the Governing Council comes to a decision on the level of short-term interest rates that best serves the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">On the basis of this strategy, I am confident that the Governing Council has taken - and will continue to take - appropriate monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The effectiveness of these policy decisions will depend, in large part, on the credibility of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Transparent and accountable policy-making can help to build up a reputation and, hence credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Transparency and accountability, in turn, rely on clear and effective communications between the Eurosystem and the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In this regard, the Eurosystem faces an especially formidable task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">As mentioned earlier, the euro area currently consists of eleven different sovereign nations, each with its own distinct monetary history and heritage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">With each policy announcement or Monthly Bulletin, the Eurosystem must thus communicate with the public of eleven different countries and must speak in all eleven different official languages of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.85,0)">Such a situation is unprecedented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.42,0)">This diversity of language, history and culture across the euro area raises further challenges for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Over the years, each national central bank had developed its own strategy and, linked to this, its own "monetary policy language" for communicating with the public in the nation it served.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This language reflected the unique circumstances of the country in question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">The process by which the public learnt this monetary language from the statements and behaviour of the national central bank was largely subconscious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Over time, the strategies and the related language and conventions of monetary policy came to be so well understood as to be almost second nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.29,0)">In these circumstances, private economic behaviour was shaped by the monetary policy environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.14,0)">Many of us have experienced the problem of trying to learn a second language in adult life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.14,0)">This rarely comes as easily as learning your native tongue as a child.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It is certainly not a subconscious process, but rather one that requires effort and perseverance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.48,0)">It is often difficult to overcome the habits and conventions of one's first language, which are inevitably somewhat at odds with those of a foreign tongue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Of course, it is easier to learn a language that shares common roots with one's own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Nevertheless, to obtain any degree of fluency, there is no alternative to long hours practising pronunciation, studying grammar and learning vocabulary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.18,0)">Even then, the idioms and slang of the new language are sometimes hard to follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">There are no easy short cuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.1,0)">With the adoption of the euro last January, the public, financial markets and policy-makers in the euro area have all had to get used to a new monetary policy environment and have, thus, had to learn a new "monetary policy language".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy has been designed, in part, to make this learning process as straightforward as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Continuity with the successful strategies of the national central banks prior to Monetary Union was one of the guiding principles governing the selection of the monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Nevertheless, given the changed environment for monetary policy, a new strategy with a new vocabulary had to be developed, reflecting the unique and novel circumstances facing the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.61,0)">Some commentators have suggested that the Eurosystem simply adopt the strategy used by another central bank or by a national central bank in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Tellingly, such observers often suggest the strategy they know best: Americans suggest using the Federal Reserve as a model; Britons, the Bank of England; Germans, the Bundesbank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.93,0)">However, the Eurosystem cannot simply adopt a strategy designed by another central bank for a different currency area under different economic circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.9,0)">A strategy that might have been suitable in one situation may be quite inappropriate for the unique and novel circumstances facing the Eurosystem, given the very different economic structure and environment confronting it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.98,0)">A key feature of the ECB's communication policy is the monthly press conference given by the ECB's Vice-President and myself, usually immediately following the first Governing Council meeting of each month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">During these press conferences, I make an introductory statement summarising the Council's discussions and conclusions before answering questions from journalists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.24,0)">As the statement is agreed, in substance, with all the Council members beforehand it is similar to what others call minutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The press conference provides prompt information in an even-handed way, and it offers the opportunity for immediate two-way communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.98,0)">As far as I am aware, no other central bank communicates with the public in such a prompt manner immediately after its monetary policy meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">These press conferences are a tangible expression of the Eurosystem's commitment to be open, transparent and accountable in its conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In my view, our commitment to openness should not be in doubt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">However, ensuring that this openness translates into effective communications continues to be a challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Journalists, financial markets and the public are still learning the new strategy and language of monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.99,0)">By its nature, the challenge of improving communications between the Eurosystem and the public is two-sided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">On the one hand, the ECB must use a clear and transparent language consistent with the strategy it has adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It must help the public understand the changes of emphasis and communication necessitated by the new monetary policy environment in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">We have made important progress in this regard over the last eight months, but I acknowledge that we still have some way to go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The ECB must do its utmost to be understood by its counterparts in the media that act as important intermediaries to the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">By learning from one another, we can improve the transparency, democratic accountability and effectiveness of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Before concluding, I should like to add a brief comment on the likely future enlargement of the European Union   and, prospectively, the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Currently, the EU negotiates the accession of six countries to the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Once the accession of new Member States is decided, these countries have to fulfil the so-called convergence criteria, if they want to join the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The euro area can finally only be enlarged if the European Council, following an assessment by the ECB and the European Commission, decides that further Member States of the EU are ready to adopt the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">New countries joining the euro area will be a challenge for us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">For example, we will have to integrate the respective economy fully in our area-wide analysis of monetary, financial and other economic developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Enlargement is a challenge we clearly welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">I have no doubts that we can master it, not least as the EC Treaty outlines a clear and transparent procedure for countries wishing to join the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.06,0)">In simple terms, this can be viewed as involving three phases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">First, a candidate country must join the European Union, for which certain requirements must be met.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Second, the candidate is expected to join the new exchange rate mechanism, ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Third, as mentioned earlier, the country must fulfil the convergence criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In addition to fiscal discipline and inflation control, these criteria include a relatively low level of long-term interest rates and stable exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.9,0)">Monetary policy cannot solve all of the economic challenges facing the euro area, in particular those concerning the urgent need to reduce the high level of structural unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">National governments are responsible for carrying out the required structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">The Eurosystem makes its best contribution to area-wide growth and employment prospects by credibly focusing on the maintenance of price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">I am confident that the monetary policy strategy adopted by the Governing Council of the ECB last October has been successful - and the monetary policy decisions that have been based on it over the last eight months - serve the fulfilment of this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Nevertheless, we will not become complacent; on the contrary, we will have to continue to invest substantially in analysing the structure of the euro area economy, and in understanding the monetary policy transmission mechanism and the information content of the various monetary and economic indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Monetary policy is most effective when it is credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Transparent and accountable policy-making can help to build up a reputation and credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Effective direct communications with the public, including the financial markets, other policy makers and the media requires that we speak with one voice in an even-handed way with our diverse counterparties and audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Successfully refining our area-wide communications, aimed at making our strategy, and the monetary policy based on it, transparent so that it can be well understood by the large and varied population we serve, is one of the challenges faced by the Eurosystem and, by implication, one of our priorities.</span>
