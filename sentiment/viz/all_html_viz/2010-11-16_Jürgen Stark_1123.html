    <h1> The new normal </h1>
    <h2> Intervention by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 13th Euro Finance Week, Frankfurt, 16 November 2010 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jürgen Stark </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)"> The new normal Intervention by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 13th Euro Finance Week, Frankfurt, 16 November 2010 In my contribution I will discuss the question of „What is the new normal“, a question, which in light of the latest events, may strike many of you as far-fetched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But it is not, since the day-to-day management of the current sovereign debt crisis, too, requires a sense of direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.74,0)">The question is certainly a difficult one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.76,0)">To be sure, crisis times are times of rapid and unpredictable changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In this sense crisis times are transitory, leading from one “stable” situation to a new one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.89,0)">But can we really say that pre-August 2007 was normal?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Let me recall the key characteristics of that time: Strong growth of the world economy of around 5% per year; strongly increasing foreign exchange reserve accumulation; large and persisting current account deficits, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">in the US; strong and persisting house price appreciation in large parts of advanced countries; extremely muted volatility in real economic activity, essentially all variables were trending up; large and persisting profits of financial sector entities; implied probabilities of default of large banks were negligible; measures of relative credit risk at historically low levels: yield compression phenomenon; almost no liquidity risk priced into financial contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">If you were a policy maker, would you take this characterisation as a benchmark for the design of post-crisis policies and frameworks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As the answer is obvious, the pertinent question is rather: What should be expected to be the “new normal”?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">What can be said with some certainty is that in the “new normal” financial markets will function more smoothly than today and economic growth will in general be on a sustainable path, reflecting the growth potential of the respective economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But a number of elements will have changed due to experiences made during the crisis and the policy responses which followed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Specifically, I would expect unsustainable deficit paths to continue no longer; business models in financial markets to come under far closer scrutiny; the valuation of liquidity to increase permanently; new regulation to render financial intermediation more secure, but also more costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.51,0)">What does this imply in concrete terms?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In my view, Pre-crisis growth paths are unlikely to be reached again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Risk premia will stay elevated, relative to pre-crisis levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.11,0)">More market players in financial markets will exit as their business models will have become unsustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">We are likely to experience more volatility in macroeconomic variables than in the pre-crisis period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Central banks are likely to show a stronger tendency of “ leaning against the wind” if unsustainable asset price developments emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Macro-prudential risks will be monitored more closely, as exemplified by the establishment of the ESRB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">ECB Mandate The mandate of the ECB to deliver price stability is clear and will remain unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is anchored in the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">I am glad that we have this single mandate instead of a dual mandate or even more objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.48,0)">Mandates with several goals may overburden monetary policy, given that a central bank has only one instrument: the short-term interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Following Tinbergen and Theil, it has been recognised that a central bank endowed with one policy instrument can only pursue one independent goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The unambiguous mandate to deliver price stability is the most prominent element of a set of interrelated principles of sound monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Further important and widely accepted principles for the conduct of sound monetary policy are: Credible commitment to the mandate of price stability This principle is the basis for securely anchoring longer-term inflation expectations consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">To achieve it, the central bank must always stand ready – and be perceived as standing ready – to take all necessary actions to deliver on its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The credibility of this commitment requires the central bank to operate under the appropriate institutional set-up, most importantly political independence, and that it develops a track record which signals its willingness and capacity to deliver price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Independence from political influence The importance of this principle has been established in a large body of theoretical and empirical literature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">It is laid down in the Maastricht Treaty and has proven elementary during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Central bank independence is also fully borne out by the strict prohibition of monetary financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Medium-term orientation The medium term orientation is based on the well-established fact that long and variable lags characterise the transmission of monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.75,0)">Monetary policy cannot be used to dampen short-term effects on price developments, and it should avoid fine tuning of demand conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Transparency and accountability Transparency and accountability strengthen the credibility of the central bank’s commitment to price stability, by ensuring that the public understands that the motivation behind monetary policy decisions is the pursuit of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Comprehensive analytical framework Monetary policy decisions must be underpinned by a comprehensive analytical framework, which ensures that all relevant and available information support timely and efficient decision making in the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The ECB’s two pillar strategy provides such a framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It combines the results of the economic analysis with those of the monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.52,0)">The experience from the financial crisis has demonstrated very clearly that it is not sufficient for the conduct of sound monetary policy to study short-term cyclical developments in the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Rather, the monetary analysis helps to identify longer term risks to price stability and supports thus the medium term orientation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.7,0)">Monetary analysis can also signal financial imbalances and vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">It is an important input in any strategy of “leaning against the wind”, as mentioned above.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Separation principle Generally, a clear distinction must be maintained between the determination of the monetary policy stance and the provision of liquidity to the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This “separation principle” ensures that the conduct of liquidity provision is not interpreted by market participants as signalling the future course of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Technically this means that the EONIA is kept very close to the main policy rate in normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.88,0)">Through the adoption of fixed-rate full allotment in the longer-term refinancing operations the EONIA has been deviating from the main refinancing rate and has been closer to the deposit rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.0,0)">With a normalisation in financial markets the demand for excess liquidity is dropping, so that the withdrawal of non-standard measures can proceed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">As a result the EONIA will ultimately return to levels around the main refinancing rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Hence, the separation principle will be fully re-established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The monetary policy of the ECB is firmly grounded in this set of principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">They are partly embedded in the Maastricht Treaty   and in our operational framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Also in a “new normal” environment we will continue to do everything to deliver what we have delivered so far which is, according to our mandate, price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.22,0)">Where does the ECB stand in terms of phasing out non-standard measures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Using its broad operational framework, the Eurosystem in a context of a severely impaired interbank market was capable to alleviate banks’ concerns about access to liquidity and thereby to support the flow of credit to households and corporations and ensure the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">All our non-standard measures – enhanced credit support and Securities Market Programme – were exceptional responses to extraordinary circumstances and as such temporary in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Specifically, all measures taken during the period of acute financial market tensions are fully in line with our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Overall, our non-standard measures have proved effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.69,0)">This contradicts academic literature on the “irrelevance of monetary policy operations”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">However: These measures represent strong medicine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">We therefore need to constantly assess whether or not it is still warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The ECB has a strategy in place to phase out the liquidity support measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.73,0)">The process of phasing out started in December 2009: We suspended liquidity provision at maturities of 6-month and 1-year; the covered bond purchase programme was completed in June this year, as originally planned; we restricted liquidity provision in foreign currencies to USD.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">By now the following liquidity support measures have remained in place: unlimited liquidity provision in our refinancing operations at a fixed interest rate and the SMP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">How will the phasing out process proceed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Our decisions will be guided by gradualism and steadiness and will be consistent with improvements in financial market conditions and real activity In my view, conditions in both money and financial markets have improved significantly over recent months, notwithstanding the most recent tensions in some segments of the European sovereign debt market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.21,0)">Since summer, the amount of liquidity demanded in ECB refinancing operations has declined by about one third  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.37,0)">As a consequence, excess liquidity has dropped by about 60%  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.38,0)">This process has been driven by receding demand on the part of financial market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Furthermore, we have experienced a re-activation of the interbank money market: The EONIA volume has nearly doubled since summer  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">I would take this development as a positive sign that banks trust each other more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.09,0)">Nevertheless, the question remains whether there is something that has changed in interbank money markets which would lead to lower activity at present and in the future – temporarily or permanently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.12,0)">Furthermore, to what extent does the fixed-rate full allotment and the narrower corridor dampen market activity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.46,0)">The phasing out of our liquidity support measures will continue after the end of the current quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.81,0)">What will this phasing out lead us to?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">An important lesson is that the operational framework and the principles underlying its design have served the ECB well both before and during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The principles are: operational efficiency, a strong market orientation, simplicity and transparency and equal treatment of counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">The post-crisis operational framework needs to be designed in a way that creates the proper incentives for the banking community to assume its responsibilities and take the appropriate decisions in a timely manner to shape a healthy banking sector at the service of the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Yet, some future changes may be envisaged due to the “new normal” world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.29,0)">One example may be the impact of the new liquidity regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">We will carefully monitor and adapt the framework, in line with the principles, if need arises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me sum up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">We seem to be in the process of “normalisation” in the sense that we move to a more stable situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.22,0)">However, the crisis is not over yet and the situation in some financial market segments remains challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The “new normal” will be different, but still difficult to characterise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.89,0)">The crisis will have changed the economic and financial environment a lot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.53,0)">Which of these changes will be temporary, which ones more permanent?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">- Most likely we will see lower but more sustainable growth paths.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">- I would expect risks to be priced more appropriately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">- As exemplified by the recent agreement on Basel III at the G20 level, regulation and supervision will be strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The lessons to be learned in central banking are that principles of sound monetary policy need to be safeguarded: a clear mandate, a medium-term and broad-based monetary policy strategy, taking into account information on money and credit, and independence from political influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Finally I would note that non-standard measures were the exceptional response to exceptional circumstances.</span>
