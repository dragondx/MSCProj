    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.76,0)"> Taming the fire Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Credit Risk 2017 forum, Vienna, 23 March 2017 Theodore Roosevelt is supposed to have said: “Risk is like fire: if controlled it will help us; if uncontrolled it will rise up and destroy us”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I think that describes quite well the modern financial world and its risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.78,0)">Managing financial risks is a bit like controlling a fire.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.01,0)">It’s the job of chief risk officers, the CROs, to constantly remind decision-makers about the “fire safety rules”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The recent financial crisis showed how important that job is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.81,0)">It’s a job that requires CROs to be steadfast and to speak unpleasant truths from time to time – just like banking supervisors have to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It’s regulation that helps us to do our job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Regulation seeks to control risks as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Following the devastating “fire” of the financial crisis, we have overhauled the rules for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">We have mended them, strengthened them, and expanded them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">That was the correct and necessary thing to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But now it is time to finish the job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">More than eight years after the crisis, banks need regulatory certainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But the job needs be finished at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.74,0)">The financial system is global and so should be the rules that govern it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.07,0)">You cannot enjoy fresh air on your patch of land while there is a fire raging on your neighbour’s – sooner or later the wind will blow smoke and sparks over the fence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Against that backdrop, I welcome the fact that, last weekend, the G20 have confirmed their support for the work to finalise Basel III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.73,0)">But there are still some voices who question the general extent of the regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.72,0)">To be crystal clear: it would be wrong to soften the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This would just prepare the ground for the next crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.96,0)">I cannot deny, though, that rules put a burden on those who have to comply – the banks, that is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.18,0)">In that regard, it is often claimed that the burden on banks translates into a burden on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.99,0)">It’s said that banks could no longer pursue their traditional business because the capital requirements are too strict.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.44,0)">It’s also said that new business models would not make economic sense because of the regulatory cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.35,0)">All that would hurt the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">There are two things I can say in response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.76,0)">First, I do not see that regulation keeps banks from their traditional business of financing the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Loans to private households and smaller companies are treated very favourably when it comes to capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Think of the support factor in Article 501 of the Capital Requirements Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This factor was introduced to facilitate the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I also do not see that regulation keeps banks from developing new business models – those, for instance, that follow from digitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.24,0)">Second, critics neglect the benefits of strong rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.56,0)">Strong rules prevent crises, and crises hurt the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">At the end of the day, it is only well-managed and well-capitalised banks that are able to finance the economy – even when the going gets tough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">They can finance the economy throughout the entire business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.79,0)">Poorly capitalised and poorly managed banks, on the other hand, cannot support the economy during downturns – they get into difficulty themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Strong rules therefore help the economy in a sustainable way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">And even if we only consider the banks, we still see benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Stronger rules increase trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.66,0)">And as a result of the crisis, a great deal of trust was lost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.11,0)">And that’s a problem for banks because trust is a crucial asset for them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Trust has a positive impact on funding costs for banks, and it determines how attractive a bank is for business partners who think long-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Strong rules thus help the banks, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Altogether, I am convinced that the benefits of regulation are greater than the costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But rules can only take us so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.08,0)">Ultimately, it is people who make good or bad decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.92,0)">And this is where banks’ risk managers come into play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">They are the first line of defence against excessive risks.</span>
