    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)"> Stable Euro, Strong Europe Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,at the Wirtschaftstag 2013Berlin,25 June 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to speak to you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">And I am grateful for the invitation from the Wirtschaftsrat, an institution grounded on the principles of the Soziale Marktwirtschaft in the tradition of Ludwig Erhard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In a speech here in Berlin just 18 months ago, I quoted Erhard’s famous dictum: ‘Die soziale Marktwirtschaft ist ohne eine konsequente Politik der Preisstabilität nicht denkbar’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">So I am happy to accept our host’s invitation to reflect on the importance of a stable euro and a strong Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">All policy-makers can and should contribute to preserving the stability of our common currency and to building a stronger and more prosperous Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">I would like to emphasise my personal commitment to this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">I am confident that through our joint efforts to complete the institutional architecture of economic and monetary union  , we can serve this collective mission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The European Central Bank   has an unambiguous mandate against which our performance can be measured: medium-term price stability, understood as an average annual inflation rate of just below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The ECB’s task and track record With this objective, we are continuing for 17 countries what the Deutsche Bundesbank achieved for Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Our history is younger, but it is with some pride that I say that the ECB has accomplished this objective for almost 15 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">And it is with emphasis that I say that we are committed to taking the exact same objective into the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The euro’s track record demonstrates the ECB’s success in attaining this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.62,0)">According to our projections, by the end of 2014, the average annual inflation rate since the start of the euro will decline to 1.97%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">This inflation record over such a long period is well below those recorded in any larger country now part of the euro area in the half-century preceding the euro and also compares very well in an international context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The ECB’s track record is therefore remarkable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Our commitment to taking the exact same objective forward is reflected in inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">They confirm that the currency is stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Survey- and market-based measures of inflation expectations are firmly anchored at levels consistent with our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In the spirit of Ludwig Erhard, the ECB is making its contribution to the social market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The ECB’s response and instruments Having the same objective does not necessarily mean using the same instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The ECB has inherited its objective from the Bundesbank, but it is operating in a new and different environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Today’s economic and monetary union is larger and more diverse than a single country, such as Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It is highly integrated but still at times fragmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And it comprises a very large number of policy-makers on fiscal, structural and other economic matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.02,0)">All policy-makers have to recognise that we belong to EMU together and that policies as well as policy inaction create spillovers for other members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This is an enormous responsibility for governments and other economic policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">For the ECB to operate in this environment, and to be responsible and effective in accomplishing its objective, we have to use a wide range of instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Some instruments are standard, some non-standard, but all are based on the ECB Statutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The use of these instruments has been essential in safeguarding our objective during the financial and sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.06,0)">In the run-up to the crisis, inappropriate fiscal, structural and other economic policies fostered an excessive build-up of risk in the financial sector and created vulnerabilities on a global scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.88,0)">When the crisis erupted, these vulnerabilities placed a heavy burden on central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.37,0)">In particular, the threat of a financial meltdown jeopardised their capability to counteract downside risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The ECB acted on that threat according to our unambiguous mandate to deliver price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.68,0)">We have reduced our main policy rates to historical lows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This contributed to stabilising investment and consumption decisions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Our actions prevented a steeper fall in aggregate demand and ensured the conditions for stable prices in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In a bank-based economy like the euro area, monetary policy works through banks, and banks lend to each other, based on mutual trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.72,0)">In the crisis, that trust got lost, and the banks no longer lent to each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.4,0)">Facing the threat of a euro-area wide funding crisis, they turned to the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We, the central bank, provided liquidity to banks because we have to work through them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">They are our counterparts – and we had to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.02,0)">There was no guarantee that the liquidity provided would all end up in the real economy but because we acted, we avoided an even larger credit crunch and a collapse of parts of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">We designed our instruments so as to provide long-term credit to banks and give them reassurance that they could satisfy their liquidity needs over an extended period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">This gave banks a clear funding perspective and put them in a position to provide credit lines to the real economy, in line with their business assessment of credit risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.19,0)">ECB policy responses over the past 12 months By mid-2012, the crisis took a new turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.19,0)">We saw the risk of a complete collapse of all credit markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.97,0)">Risks to fiscal sustainability and growing market distrust in some euro area countries started to spill over into their respective banking sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.98,0)">Close links between sovereigns and banks threatened the stability of the entire banking sector in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.55,0)">While impairments to the transmission of monetary policy eased in some countries, they became entrenched and more acute in others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.19,0)">Fractures in transmission – a new phenomenon since the start of EMU – appeared along national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.29,0)">Investors suddenly lost confidence that the euro area could survive in its current composition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.42,0)">In fact, the prospect that claims on certain governments and private companies in certain countries could not be discharged in euros had become a possibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.22,0)">International investors started divesting securities issued by governments of non-core economies and of private institutions domiciled in those countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Germany became the destination of ‘safe-haven’ flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.77,0)">Capital, deposits and central bank liquidity were leaving the periphery and concentrating in the core.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.89,0)">Market interest rates in Germany fell as bond prices were driven upwards, and at some point, German bond market rates were lower than ECB refinancing rates!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.55,0)">At the same time, the loss of liquidity and bank funding capacity in the periphery produced a tightening of credit conditions in those economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.25,0)">Interest rates for bank customers, firms and households were dropping in the core and rising in the periphery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.97,0)">Eventually, the fragmentation of financial conditions became so severe that we were effectively losing the steering ability of our monetary policy for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In this environment, we once again had to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">As our main instrument, we announced the programme of Outright Monetary Transactions   in secondary government bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The aim is to eliminate redenomination risk, namely uncertainty about the survival of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Since OMT was announced almost one year ago, its benefits have been widely acknowledged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The glut of liquidity in core economies has been partly reabsorbed, as deposits and savings have returned to the periphery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.71,0)">Interest rates in Germany have increased and they have fallen in the periphery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.23,0)">Target balances, a powerful summary indicator of fragmentation, have come down by one quarter from their peak last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.18,0)">Funding costs in the countries under stress have fallen substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Both banks and firms in stressed countries have been able to regain access to market financing, both for funding and raising capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Our initiative has therefore been beneficial to all: banks, companies and households – and it has benefited both periphery and core countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me highlight a few features of OMT that are essential to bear in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">First, OMT comes with strict and effective conditionality attached to a programme with the European Stability Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The initiative is activated only if a country submits to policy conditionality that leads to policy reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.27,0)">Governments are not presented with a choice between reforms or OMT.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">OMT comes only with reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">And reforms need a disciplined process of monitoring and international surveillance for the country concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Otherwise, there is no OMT activation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Second, conditionality enhances the independence and the effectiveness of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The reason is that conditionality is a necessary but not sufficient condition to activate OMT.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">We would only act if the right conditions for effective use of this monetary policy instrument were in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Third, the ECB would not act to compress spreads artificially; on the contrary, we believe that spreads should naturally reflect the underlying fiscal position of the sovereign and the economic prospects of the country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This is also why we emphasised that a sovereign needs to have market access to qualify for OMT.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Fourth, OMT does not entail a transfer of risks from periphery to core countries via the ECB’s balance sheet, over and beyond risks that are inevitable and inherent in the implementation of a single monetary policy for 17 sovereign states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.53,0)">The OMT announcement has lowered risks for core countries: the risks of a euro area break-up; the risks arising from Target balances in such a scenario; and the risks from market interest rates distorted by safe-haven flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Because of OMT, the euro area is a more stable and resilient place to invest in than it was a year ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Indeed, I would say that OMT is even more essential now as we see potential changes in the monetary policy stance with associated uncertainty in other jurisdictions of the integrated global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Essential reforms going forward So where do we stand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">In terms of monetary policy, price stability is assured, and the overall economic outlook still warrants an accommodative stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We see some signs of stabilisation in sentiment, even though uncertainties remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">And we expect that monetary stimulus and improvements in financial markets will support a recovery later in the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The situation has improved; fragmentation has receded; and tentative signs of stabilisation have occurred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">But monetary policy is only a small part of the overall policy agenda for overcoming the crisis and laying the foundations for sustainable growth and renewed employment creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Governments, social partners and other important economic decision-makers have to live up to their responsibilities, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">One key issue is structural reform to make euro area economies more business friendly and more competitive in the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">There is a host of indicators – from the Global Competitiveness indicators to the Ease of Doing Business indicators – that lay out the reform agenda in no uncertain terms: only a handful of euro area countries rank highly on these indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Germany is among them, thanks to the resolute structural reforms implemented in this country ten years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">These reforms are an inspiration for other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.3,0)">Many European countries have structural problems: it takes longer to get licenses, permits and other administrative authorisations than in other countries; the judicial system is slower; and regulation is more complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Structural reforms may hurt a few vested interests, but they would clearly strengthen the effectiveness, competitiveness and, yes, also the fairness of our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Another key issue is growth-friendly fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We have to be mindful that debt-based fiscal spending is no way to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Euro area government debt has risen by almost 20 percentage points of GDP in the last 15 years and by over 50 percentage points in the last 30 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.66,0)">At the same time, growth has fallen, from 3.8% on average in the 1970s to 2.1% in the 1990s and roughly zero now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Debt spending has not avoided the stagnation of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">But fiscal consolidation can be made much more growth-friendly by cutting unproductive expenditures, by establishing credible and detailed medium-term fiscal plans and by lowering the tax burden where it is harming economic activity and job creation in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The third key issue is ensuring a sound financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This is where current efforts to establish a European banking union are crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">The aim of the banking union is to establish transparency, stability and incentive-compatibility in the euro area financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Conclusion I have outlined what we at the ECB have been doing – and what needs to be done in other key domains of European economic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">The June 2012 summit was so important because in times of great uncertainty it provided a clear vision of what is necessary for a stable and genuine economic and monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Much of it is being implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">And I am confident that the project for Europe will continue to evolve towards renewed economic strength and social cohesion based on mutual trust, both within and across national borders, and above all stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
