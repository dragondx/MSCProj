    <span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)"> Harmonising cashless payments: the SEPA experience Dinner speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, ECB Seminar “Sharing the European Experience in Retail Payments Integration and Innovation”, InterContinental Hotel, Silhouette Room, 7.00 p.m.Frankfurt am Main, 15 April 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to have dinner with you tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">I am very happy that central bankers from all five continents are together here today and tomorrow to hear about Europe’s experience in retail payments integration and innovation, and to talk about how this experience could benefit other countries and communities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Sharing information and exchanging views with colleagues from different parts of the world benefits us at the ECB, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In fact, this seminar gives us all an opportunity to enhance our knowledge and to strengthen personal and institutional ties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Before dinner is served, let me give you some food for thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">There are different ways to establish and maintain a domestic, integrated retail payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To illustrate this, let me first briefly look at the retail payments market in Europe, which has been fragmented along national lines and is still integrating, and then compare it with the market in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Although the population of the US is comparable with that of the euro area  , the US still generates a higher GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Households have a considerably higher gross disposable income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Yet the gross savings of households in the euro area   are higher than in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Given these figures, it is not surprising that the number of cashless payment transactions per inhabitant in the US is higher than in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">However, the fact that it is twice as high is remarkable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.99,0)">Why do the retail payments markets in the US and euro area differ?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.54,0)">As I will explain, it’s not only because of customer preferences and technology, but also because of different approaches to regulation and different pricing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.41,0)">The paths followed for payment transactions will always differ from country to country and region to region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">But, the diversity of instruments reveals some interesting facts about the retail payments market in both areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.22,0)">In the US, about two-thirds of cashless payment transactions are card payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.46,0)">Of those card payments, one-third of them are made with credit cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.68,0)">In the euro area, card payments are less dominant: just over one-third of cashless payment transactions are card payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Debit cards are generally preferred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Consequently, whereas consumer credit cards are the biggest driver of revenue in the US payments industry  , their role in the euro area is less prominent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It has been rightly pointed out in one of the presentations today that, in contrast to the US, the sustainability of card business models in the euro area depends – notably because of regulatory interventions – on improvements in efficiency and on the cost side, and not on driving revenue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.18,0)">An Occasional Paper published by the ECB in September 2012 entitled “The social and private costs of cash and retail payment instruments – A European perspective” shows that in Europe debit card payments have on average the lowest social costs per euro transaction value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">In other words, society may benefit from an increase in their usage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.18,0)">The same paper reported that cheques were the most expensive form of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Thus, they are not part of the integration efforts in the retail payments market in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">In the US however, despite a steady decline, cheques still play an important role as a cashless payment instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In fact, they are used more often than credit transfers and direct debits put together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.5,0)">The low number of electronic payments   in the US has not only to do with consumer preference and systemic restrictions on consumer-initiated transfers but also with the set-up of batch processing of electronic payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.98,0)">The CEO of Western Union has commented that bank-to-bank credit transfers in the US are so complicated that banks ask Western Union to process them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As you heard this morning, the creation of domestic credit transfer and direct debit schemes formed the basis of the Single Euro Payments Area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">These electronic payment instruments facilitate straight-through-processing   and are thus operationally efficient solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">They can also serve as the basis for further developments in online and mobile payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The ultimate aim of SEPA is to create a truly domestic European retail payments market which does not differentiate between euro payments made by individuals, businesses or public administrations within one country or between SEPA countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, a former member of the ECB’s Executive Board, called this the “principle of indifference”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In that sense, SEPA is also part of the political objective to create a more integrated Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">The creation of a safe and efficient domestic retail payments market is also an issue of social relevance because individuals and businesses in any country can benefit from retail payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">It is a means to increase financial inclusion and it strengthens the formal economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">It also has great potential to make remittance payments cheaper and more efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Let me emphasise: SEPA is one of Europe’s most successful financial integration projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Even during the current financial crisis, SEPA has shown its strengths and its implementation has continued without major obstacles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This may be because, as research has shown, effective retail payment services are associated with greater bank stability and because banks perform better in countries with more developed retail payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Last but not least, there is evidence that retail payments have a positive impact on economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Let me conclude by saying that in a world marked by growing mobility and by increasing cross-border trade, retail payments cannot and should not be overlooked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In Europe, with its single market for goods, capital, services and a single currency, it is essential to harmonise cashless payments via such a system as SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">I am convinced that this harmonisation can serve as a valuable point of reference for further integration activities in other parts of the world and also at global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">European retail payment integration should not be seen as a stand-alone project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.21,0)">There are interdependencies with standardization and regulatory issues at global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.14,0)">For instance, full EMV migration for cards in Europe and the move to chip-only cards remain difficult as long as there are regions in the world where the magnetic stripe remains dominant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">And yet, SEPA and Europe’s retail payments integration is affecting initiatives for integration at global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">International initiatives such as the International Payments Framework Association   see SEPA as a blueprint for developing multi-currency schemes for non-urgent cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">These initiatives face the additional challenge of accommodating control requirements relating to anti-money laundering and countering terrorist finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Finally, retail payments integration at global level may also extend to the remittance market and make remittance payments cheaper and more efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">These are all weighty matters and I’m sure you’ll be considering them in the sessions tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">I hope you will have a stimulating, useful and successful morning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But now, I’d like to wish you bon appétit!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.73,0)">Table 1: Use of payment instruments: number of transaction per inhabitant   Euro area US credit transfer 51 25 direct debit 54 38
