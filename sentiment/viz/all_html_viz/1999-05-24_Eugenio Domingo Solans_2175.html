    <span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)"> Should the ECB have broader objectives beyond price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Eugenio Domingo SolansMember of the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the European Central Bank.A speech given at the Wilton Park conference on "EMU: ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE "INS", "OUTS" AND EUROPEAN BUSINESS" at Wiston House, West Sussex, on 24 May 1999 Thank you for inviting me to participate as a speaker at the Wilton Park Conference on Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">It is an honour and a real pleasure for me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The question in the title of my session "Should the ECB have broader objectives beyond price stability?"</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">deserves a clear and immediate answer: yes, the ECB should have and, as a matter of fact, it does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Article 105 of the Maastricht Treaty   states that "the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability" and adds that "without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community as laid down in Article 2".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Among others, these Community objectives are, in accordance with Article 2, "sustainable and non-inflationary growth respecting the environment" and "a high level of employment and of social protection".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It is, therefore, clear that the ECB must focus its decisions, as a matter of priority, on the objective of stability which is its real "raison d'etre"; in addition, and without prejudice to this aim of stability, the ECB also has responsibilities relating to economic growth, employment and social protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.53,0)">These responsibilities are general, conditional and secondary, if you like, but responsibilities nevertheless.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Thus, it seems clear that beyond the primary objective of price stability, the ECB also has an implicit secondary objective: to support the other economic policies and, in doing so, to contribute to economic growth, and to reach a high level of employment and social protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">If we accept more than one general objective for monetary policy, it seems important to stress the need to prioritise these objectives and, in the case of the ESCB, to give top priority to the objective of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.6,0)">Any doubts about this could undermine the confidence of the public and the markets in the ESCB's commitment to stability, trigger inflationary expectations, and eventually - and paradoxically - hinder or jeopardise economic growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Before getting into the impact of monetary policy on economic growth, let me say a few words concerning the close relationship which exists between stability and social protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.96,0)">In the first article I published,   only 30 years ago, when I was only 23 years old, I dared to qualify inflation as "immoral", for several reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.36,0)">Inflation unfairly deteriorates personal income and wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.6,0)">It distorts the proper functioning of public redistributive schemes, such as progressive taxation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.63,0)">It fosters speculation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.88,0)">It harms the weakest and the most vulnerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.82,0)">My branding inflation as "immoral" caused surprise when I mentioned it after my appointment as a member of the Executive Board of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I must say I was surprised at the surprise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Without a doubt, one of the best allies of social justice is, precisely, stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.97,0)">Surprising again, if you consider that, very often, those less inclined to support institutional arrangements and policies in favour of stability are precisely those who actively pretend to take a leading role in public in favour of social justice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Let us now focus on the relationship between the ECB's monetary policy, price stability and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">I am convinced that, in the medium term, the best contribution that the ECB can make in favour of sustained economic growth is, precisely, to create an environment, an atmosphere of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Stability implies efficient allocation of resources, competitiveness, lower interest rate risk premiums, investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">All these factors are preconditions for economic growth or, in other words, preconditions for the fulfilment of the secondary objective of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">In securing its objective of stability, the Eurosystem creates the necessary conditions to comply with the European Union's objective of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">There is clearly no greater fertiliser for economic growth than price stability, and nothing is more refractory to economic growth than inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">I said that stability is "the best contribution" to growth, but I believe that it is not the only possible contribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.11,0)">In other words, I understand that we cannot comply with the implicit secondary objective of the ECB stemming from the Treaty by means of simple adherence to its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The ECB's motto cannot be "only stability matters" or "the greater stability, the better".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This could be true in the long run, where monetary policy only affects prices   but not quantities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">But in the short term, monetary policy affects both prices and quantities and, therefore, we must accept the possibility of the existence of a trade-off between stability and growth, in line with the traditional Phillips curve as reformulated by Samuelson and Solow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The existence in the short term of a trade-off between stability and growth implies for the ECB the need to consider the possibility of a compromise between the degree of stability and the level of economic growth, and I emphasise that I said "degree of stability" and growth, and not a compromise between "stability" itself and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.49,0)">Stability is a concept rather than a single figure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Any price increase low or short enough so as not to cause distortions in price-setting  , and low or short enough so as not to require the implementation of a general indexation procedure   is compatible with the concept of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.39,0)">The ECB understands that this is the case when the year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area as a whole stays below 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">A price increase of below 2% for the whole euro area not only does not prevent the existence of national or regional levels of HICP increases above and below the common level, it even implies the existence of such national or regional levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Therefore, one must accept as normal that in some specific countries the inflation rate could be higher than 2% without any inconsistency with the stability of the whole area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.97,0)">The differences in inflation can be the result of the Balassa-Samuelson effect, or the result of a combination of a high level of nominal demand and supply rigidities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Nevertheless, if we accept that inflation is a monetary phenomenon and that the monetary policy stance determines the level of inflation in the medium term, we must conclude that these national differences in the HICP increase cannot be too large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.47,0)">Why below 2%?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.66,0)">This limit is, of course, a convention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It could be 2.5% instead, just the same as one could set the speed limit at 90 kmph instead of 80 kmph.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">But, on the other hand, stability cannot be defined as an increase in prices of, say, up to 4%, just as 160 kmph is not a real speed limit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The substance underlying the 2% stability limit is that price increase should take measurement bias into account  , it should allow variations in relative prices in economies with rather downside inflexible prices and wages, and it should be low enough so as to avoid distortions in price-setting and make any general indexation process unnecessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Following our example, the limit must take into account the lack of precision of the car's speedometer, it must make it possible to overtake other vehicles safely and discourage reckless driving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Taking for granted that the previous conditions are fulfilled   and that, therefore, stability exists, the ECB's monetary policy has room for manoeuvre to create the best monetary conditions in order to support the general economic policies of the European Union and, in particular, to create the best monetary conditions for exploiting the considerable growth potential of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Against this background the ECB decided on 8 April 1999 to lower interest rates by 0.5 percentage point, a decision which, in addition, could help reduce uncertainties and restore confidence in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In this context, let me say a few words about the general orientation of the ECB's monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We understand that it should be a medium term-oriented monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.2,0)">Its short-term anti-cyclic effects - if any exist - are very limited and have to do with the influence on the confidence and expectations of economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.43,0)">The medium term, lags, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.82,0)">are factors linked to the "mechanical" channels of transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The short term and "activism" are closely linked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.44,0)">No one can expect "activism" from the ECB's monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Our monetary policy is primarily intended to provide a general framework, a general environment, a general atmosphere of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">In doing so, it creates the best conditions for economic growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Provided that stability exists, in connection with the implicit secondary objective of supporting the general economic policies of the European Union, the monetary policy of the Eurosystem contributes to creating the economic conditions which are essential for exploiting the growth potential of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">However, let me stress that it does so in a passive way, without any activism: like the air we breathe, rather than air from an oxygen tank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Fresh air as opposed to air from an oxygen tank: this is my metaphor to compare the passive monetary policy of the ECB with an active one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.8,0)">My President, Wim Duisenberg, has another, which has to do with television.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.78,0)">In this case, activism means engaging in "zapping" instead of, I would imagine, sitting quietly watching the film and waiting to discover that - oh surprise!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.29,0)">- the butler is the murderer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The metaphors of one's President are always better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Being passive does not necessarily prevent our monetary policy from having anti-cyclic effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.87,0)">Anti-cyclic and counter-cyclic do not mean exactly the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The ECB's monetary policy does not try to counter every cyclical fluctuation, but it helps to prevent pronounced cyclical fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">It tones down the economic waves; it extends the economic wavelength and, by doing so, creates the conditions for sustainable economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.01,0)">Another characteristic of the ECB's monetary policy is the absence of automatism, in the sense that monetary policy decisions do not follow on from changes in specific variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In striking a balance between rules and discretion, the ECB is closer to discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.35,0)">However, please do not confuse discretion with opacity, automatism with transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">After all, who really believes in rules robust enough to eliminate the need for discretion in monetary policy decisions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.29,0)">Who really thinks that monetary policy can be conducted with an automatic pilot?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Who really thinks that, apart from being meritorious theoretical contributions and good references, the Friedman rule or the Taylor rule are key solutions for taking monetary policy decisions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Another principle of the ECB's monetary policy is the adoption of a global Eurosystem perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.91,0)">According to this principle, it would be erroneous to interpret the monetary policy decisions of the ECB from a national standpoint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Owing to the characteristics of monetary policy, no one should expect it to conform to all the peculiarities of the countries, regions or sectors of activity of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.58,0)">We must accept that implementing monetary policy in a large area implies limitations and complications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Nonetheless, these limitations are not only counterbalanced, but also surpassed by the advantages resulting from having a single currency in a single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.67,0)">One of these limitations has to do with the fact that a single monetary policy implies a single nominal repo rate for the whole area and a single nominal short-term money market rate for the whole area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Starting from this point, the effects of monetary policy among different regions or countries of the area would be different, depending on several relevant factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.42,0)">One factor is the different level of inflation in each country implying different levels of real repo rates for each country and different real short-term money market rates for each country, which could give rise to pro-cyclical local effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.03,0)">At the same time, the transmission mechanisms of monetary policy are different in each country, reflecting differences in the structure of the financial systems and in the habits of the public; therefore, the effects of monetary policy will not be exactly the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The specific national economic policies of the governments, in making good use of the possibilities of fiscal policy and other measures linked to the supply side of the economies, are the proper way to overcome these limitations of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is wise to recognise the general limitations of monetary policy and the specific ones of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">However, let us also recognise the advantages of a common stability- oriented monetary policy for the whole area, which clearly outweigh the drawbacks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Euro area citizens can expect a lot from the Eurosystem's monetary policy, but not too much.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.87,0)">Rather than a technique, monetary policy is really an art form: the so-called "art of central banking".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.56,0)">And do not forget that, unlike those made by engineers, mistakes made by artists are always forgiven.</span><span
