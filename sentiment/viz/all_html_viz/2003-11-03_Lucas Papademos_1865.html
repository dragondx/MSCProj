    <span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)"> Growth and stability in Europe: the role of monetary policy Speech by Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the ECBat the ceremony marking the 75th anniversary of the Bank of GreeceAthens, 3 November 2003 Your Excellency the President of the Republic, Mr. Prime Minister, Dear Colleagues, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is both an honour and a pleasure for me to participate in the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the founding of the Bank of Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">This ceremony, which is being graced by the presence of the President of the Republic and the Prime Minister, commemorates the birth of a great institution in Greece and an important member of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is also an institution close to my heart, as I spent a large part of my professional life at the Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">I am, therefore, delighted to be, once again, among the former colleagues and old friends who have joined us here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">And we are all very pleased that this event is being attended by so many governors and other senior officials from central banks around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.38,0)">Anniversaries are occasions for celebration and reflection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">They are occasions for celebrating the accomplishments of the past and for reflecting on objectives and perspectives for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Indeed, anniversaries provide an opportunity to establish links between the past and the future: to set or reconfirm goals and strategies in order to meet future challenges in the light of past experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The Bank of Greece has, justifiably, many reasons to celebrate and feel proud of its achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The Bank is relatively young compared with some of the other European central banks – unless we count the time that has elapsed since the establishment of one of its forerunners: the Treasury of the City of Athens on the island of Delos, which was founded in the 5th century BC.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.41,0)">In those days, however, they made no distinction between fiscal and monetary authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.31,0)">Classical Athens, therefore, did not respect a cardinal principle of central banking: the necessary division of responsibilities between those “who spend and tax” and those with the task of safeguarding the real value and stability of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.2,0)">This was not considered essential at the time of commodity money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">In modern times, the Bank of Greece, since its establishment 75 years ago, has contributed greatly to economic and social welfare in our country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The Prime Minister and the Governor both referred extensively to the Bank’s contribution and there is no need for me to elaborate further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">At present, the Bank can look forward to continuing this tradition of excellence in performing its tasks and attaining its goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">It will have to do so, however, within the new economic environment and the institutional framework which have been established as a result of the process of European integration and the introduction of our new, common currency, the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In keeping with the character of today’s event, I would like to take a long-term view and discuss some fundamental issues regarding the main objectives and tasks of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.9,0)">I will concentrate on issues relating to monetary policy, the primary task of a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">These issues are also closely linked to the more general economic goals and policy challenges we are facing in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Alesina, A. and R.
