    <h1> Ensuring an adequate loss-absorbing capacity of central counterparties </h1>
    <h2> Special invited lecture by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 2015 Symposium on Central Clearing, Chicago, 10 April 2015 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)"> Ensuring an adequate loss-absorbing capacity of central counterparties Special invited lecture by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 2015 Symposium on Central Clearing,Chicago, 10 April 2015 Ladies and gentlemen  , This Symposium organised by the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is a major event for discussions on key themes regarding central clearing, and it is a privilege for me to deliver this lecture in front of such a distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">I would like to make some comments on a topic which has been steadily going up the central clearing agenda, namely the need to increase the loss-absorbing capacity of central counterparties   beyond their current levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Because of their growing systemic importance, CCPs need to be exceptionally robust, and that means being able to cope with even extreme losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">And to achieve this, it may well be necessary to increase their existing loss-absorbing capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But what is less clear at the moment is whether this can be done by having CCPs observe the existing, tough international standards, which have been introduced only relatively recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Or whether there is a need for new requirements that are more demanding or more specific.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">And if so, how can we best do that in a way that preserves the benefits of central clearing, provides the right incentives to CCPs and to their clearing members, and strengthens the financial system as a whole?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These questions go to the heart of the current work by the two international standard-setting bodies most directly involved, the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures   and the International Organization of Securities Commissions  , as well as by the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision   and the Financial Stability Board  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Today I will cover some of the issues authorities are tackling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The global regulatory agenda implemented since the crisis has made CCPs considerably safer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">As a result of the G20’s commitment to introduce clearing obligations, CCPs have become “super-systemically important”, and ensuring their safety is thus critical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Over the past few years, the global regulators   have offered guidance in many areas to increase the resilience of CCPs and their participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Let me give you four examples: First, rigorous risk-management standards via the Principles for financial market infrastructures: the PFMI were adopted by CPMI-IOSCO in 2012, implementing ambitious standards covering every aspect of a CCP’s risk management framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">These Principles are significantly tougher than those they replace and their consistent implementation across jurisdictions is currently being monitored  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Second, guidance on CCP recovery and resolution: in 2014, as a supplement to the PFMI, CPMI-IOSCO published comprehensive guidance on financial market infrastructure   recovery  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It considered the types of tools that CCPs and other FMIs can use to deal with severe financial problems that could threaten their existence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In addition, the FSB adopted a framework on FMI resolution  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Third, specific treatment of banks’ exposures to CCPs: the BCBS has revised its previous Basel II capital framework, which applied a zero capital charge to banks’ exposures to CCPs, in order to better capture the risks stemming from the financial system’s increasing reliance on CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">One of the main features of this revised framework is the preferential treatment given to exposures to qualifying CCPs, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">CCPs supervised in a manner consistent with the PFMI.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Finally, enhancing the understanding of CCP risks via increased transparency: in order to ensure CCPs are providing participants with the necessary information to evaluate the risks linked to clearing, CPMI and IOSCO have published two disclosure frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The Disclosure Framework and Assessment Methodology   , released in December 2012, and The Public Quantitative Disclosure Framework   for CCPs, released in February 2015, which require CCPs to disclose information on topics such as the size of their credit risk, liquidity risk, collateral, margins, business risk, custody and investment risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me add that public disclosure requirements are particularly important for indirect members who, unlike direct members, do not play a direct role in the CCP’s risk governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.9,0)">Should authorities be doing more to address potential weaknesses in CCP risk management?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">As I just mentioned, the regulatory standards have been significantly strengthened since the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.52,0)">However, catastrophic losses beyond those already covered by the regulatory requirements could still occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.64,0)">Given the critical role of CCPs in financial markets, regulators need to think the unthinkable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.3,0)">Indeed, stress events concerning CCPs are – thankfully – rare: the most recent example of a CCP failure was the collapse of the Hong Kong Futures Exchange clearing house in 1987.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.23,0)">A more recent – albeit less dramatic – stress event was the uncertainty caused by the default of a clearing member at KRX, the South Korean CCP, which caused it to tap its mutualised default fund, and revealed that clearing members were not always aware of their potential liabilities towards the CCP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.43,0)">When such events occur, they have the potential to shut down the markets they serve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.85,0)">With the emergence of super-systemic CCPs serving global derivatives markets, a CCP failure could be a catastrophic event of global proportions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In September 2014, the gross notional outstanding amount of centrally cleared positions was estimated at USD 169 trillion for OTC interest rate derivatives, and at USD 14 trillion for credit derivatives  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The sheer magnitude of these figures   gives us an idea of the severity of the potential consequences from a stress event at a major global CCP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Authorities see the distinct benefits of central clearing and wish to set proper market incentives for participants to move away from bilateral trading and into the centrally cleared world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Mandatory central clearing allows risks to be pooled, monitored and properly managed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.52,0)">However, pushing more complex products towards mandatory central clearing makes risk management more challenging, and therefore may increase the risks to which CCPs and clearing members are exposed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Authorities may need to assess whether overly complex products should really be submitted to central clearing, so as to ensure CCPs can continue pooling risks in a safe and efficient way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.46,0)">In recent months, concerns have been expressed regarding the adequacy and consistency of the level of risk management across the CCP landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.64,0)">At this stage, it is too early to say whether current regulations are insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">New requirements may well prove necessary but the impact and coverage of the existing regulatory framework should first be comprehensively assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Authorities have started exploring and analysing potential issues with the granularity and consistency of global standards, and will continue to do so in the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">For instance, CPMI-IOSCO has put in place a substantial implementation monitoring programme of the PFMI across jurisdictions  : the monitoring work so far has shown that many jurisdictions have made good progress in adopting the PFMI in their domestic regulatory frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">A more detailed analysis of whether the content and the outcome of implementing legislation, regulations and policies are complete and consistent is currently under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Furthermore, the granularity of margin practices is being reviewed, and CPMI-IOSCO is now assessing – in cooperation with the industry – the consistency of CCP stress testing practices  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Consistency does not need to be achieved by imposing standardised models on all CCPs – a “one size fits all” approach may not be appropriate, and regulators may be more effective by relying instead on minimum standards, which all CCPs would be required to apply to their models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">The outcome of these exercises will be of crucial importance in identifying and calibrating the need for further regulatory action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Staying clear of pitfalls and misconceptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">If gaps were to be identified in CCP risk management standards, requiring the adoption of new global requirements, we would need to make sure the debate is being framed in an appropriate manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First of all, there may be no single best solution for addressing concerns related to CCP safety.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">Optimal solutions may vary according to the business model of the CCP  , according to the CCP’s risk profile  , and according to the size and concentration of exposures within clearing members  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Regulators may wish to keep a certain degree of flexibility when they make their final recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.7,0)">We also need to be cautious when drawing analogies between CCPs and banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.19,0)">CCPs have in fact a fundamentally different business model and liability structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.09,0)">CCPs are not leveraged and they do not actively take risk: barring the default of a member or an operational incident, their net risk exposure at any point in time is always equal to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Another major difference is the limited extent to which CCPs are expected to cover their exposures via their own funds, as the concept of “bail-in” is directly built into their risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Indeed, coverage is achieved to a very large extent via pre-funded resources provided by the clearing members themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Bail-in is a new concept for banks, but not for CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In addition, CCPs can rely on contractual arrangements to allocate losses among their members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.77,0)">The statutory tools implemented by banking supervisors for ensuring the resilience of banks may therefore not be appropriate for CCPs, and we should be cautious about any comparisons we make.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.72,0)">They could be misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.21,0)">Furthermore, taxpayers should obviously not be liable for any losses incurred by CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Losses should be entirely borne by the CCPs themselves and their participants, in an appropriate and proportional manner, and in line with prudent incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In particular, the involvement of indirect participants should be carefully considered: their contribution to the loss allocation process should take into account the fact that they have no contractual agreements with the CCP, and, unlike direct members, have no part in the CCP’s risk governance process  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.27,0)">Lastly, the issue of compensating clearing members for losses incurred during a recovery or resolution process remains comparatively unexplored and deserves careful attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Let me now turn to the various tools that authorities could use to address potential shortcomings in CCP risk management and loss-absorption capacities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">These options have very different implications, namely in terms of sharing the funding needs between CCPs and participants, and in terms of providing the right incentives to CCPs’ stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Increasing the level of pre-funded resources held by CCPs to cover default losses beyond the current standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.87,0)">One possible conclusion from the current review of the international implementation of regulatory requirements, and the analysis and assessments being carried out in parallel, could be that standards regarding margins and stress testing are sufficiently stringent, but are not implemented consistently across CCPs and jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.95,0)">Authorities could also conclude that the standards themselves are not sufficiently strict and that there is a need for CCPs to bolster the arrangements that may be used in a pre-recovery stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This might require CCPs to cover their exposures beyond the “cover 2” standard currently set by the PFMI for systemically important CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Bear in mind that prudent margins and an adequately sized default fund are the very foundations of a CCP’s risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">If CCPs appropriately cover credit and market risks via their initial margins, and adequately stress test their exposures under extreme conditions, there will be only a residual chance that they will not be able to cover default losses  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.81,0)">We should remember that cover 2 is already a very stringent criterion, which has never been observed in a real crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.9,0)">However, as I stated earlier, the unthinkable may happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The next question is how this increase in resources should be funded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Recently, there have been some calls to increase the contributions made by CCPs themselves to the total amount of financial resources posted – the so-called “skin in the game”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In the European Union, CCPs already have to contribute 25% of their required regulatory capital to the default waterfall, which would be used before tapping the mutualised default fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Should we go further, and demand a larger contribution from CCPs?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Such a step would raise many challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">“Skin in the game” should primarily serve to provide incentives for the CCP’s management and shareholders to ensure their risk management framework is sufficiently prudent, and limits excessive risk taking by clearing members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.72,0)">It should not be seen as a significant financial resource to cover a CCP’s exposures: indeed, the purpose of CCPs is to mutualise counterparty risk, not to remove it from clearing members altogether and bear it themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.2,0)">CCPs are risk poolers, not insurance providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.29,0)">In fact, a substantial increase of “skin in the game” could provide clearing members with a false sense of security, by reducing their potential contribution to the loss-allocation process  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.95,0)">This could lead them to be less vigilant in monitoring risks, which may have severe consequences for the safety of CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Furthermore, in order to represent any meaningful part of the default waterfall, “skin in the game” would need to increase dramatically, thus completely changing the size of CCP balance sheets and their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.44,0)">This could even defeat the purpose of mandatory central clearing by pushing CCPs to dramatically increase the cost of clearing, or to compromise on their risk management in order to retain profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">In sum, it seems reasonable that an increase in prefunded resources, should it become necessary, should be mainly borne by clearing members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Strengthening CCP recovery capabilities via specific recovery tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">An alternative conclusion to our current discussions could be that cover 2 is an appropriate standard for ensuring CCP resilience in a pre-recovery phase, but that more reassurances are needed to ensure CCPs can adequately cope with a recovery situation if they face tail losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me stress that, here too, it is too early to state whether and, if so, what additional guidance regarding recovery capacities will be needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">However, let us think about the ways in which authorities could improve CCP recovery tools if the need did arise  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In a recovery situation, a significant amount of additional funding could come from ex post cash calls on non-defaulting clearing members, also referred to as “default fund top-ups” or “emergency assessments”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">This could provide CCPs with ample resources to avoid a complete depletion of their capital, and would share the funding burden across the whole clearing membership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Such assessments are usually allocated according to each member’s contribution to the CCP’s default fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This way of allocating assessments, provided it is transparent, gives members a degree of predictability about what will happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.17,0)">Nevertheless, they could expose surviving clearing members to sudden and very large liquidity demands which they would have to source in the market, and could thus have strong contagion effects   – even pushing members to close out their contracts and leave the CCP, rather than face the spiralling costs of remaining a member.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.69,0)">For these reasons, such tools may prove problematic for bank supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Another tool which is frequently mentioned in discussions on CCP recovery is variation margin gains haircutting  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In my view, this tool may have a certain advantage over ex post cash calls, in the sense that it would alleviate the need for members to raise extra liquidity to meet their obligations: the CCP would simply perform a write-down of its outgoing payment obligations to clearing members with “in the money” positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">To the extent that this tool would hit members which are not liquidity- constrained, it is more reliable and the systemic impact could be less.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">So although it could lead to unequal loss allocation among clearing members and create ex ante uncertainty on the burden sharing of the cost of default  , it could also mitigate pro-cyclicality concerns to a certain extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.84,0)">Another series of measures to be considered by authorities are the voluntary or forced allocation of open positions among clearing members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">These measures would help CCPs re-establish a matched book following a participant default.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In my view, if authorities choose to promote these tools, we should take care to encourage voluntary measures to the extent possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.02,0)">Indeed, forced allocations could lead to effects which are difficult to control, for example by requiring participants to take on positions which are not closely related to their clearing activities, and for which they cannot adequately measure risks, particularly in volatile market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.95,0)">A last-resort option could be a partial or complete tear-up of open positions, but this could cause significant disruption to the products and markets where contracts are terminated, and therefore should be avoided to the extent practicable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">A solution which seems to be supported by parts of the industry would be to dedicate an additional tranche of the CCP’s capital for recovery needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">While increases could be discussed, I believe it may not be advisable – for the reasons already outlined above – to place the entire burden of extra loss-absorption on CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">For the sake of completeness, I would also like to mention alternative recovery tools such as the proposal by a consortium of insurers to provide coverage for extreme tail losses, or the idea that CCPs should issue bail-in-able debt instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Such solutions deserve consideration as they can enhance market discipline, but they require further analysis before being truly considered as viable options by authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.57,0)">For example, it is unclear whether there would be a deep enough market for CCP bail-in-able debt, given the tail nature of the risk being priced, and the risk that demand will be exhausted once the total loss-absorbing capacity proposal for banks is calibrated and implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">You will note that I have not made any mention of emergency liquidity provision to CCPs by central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">A fundamental principle is that it is up to the CCP to maintain adequate and robust liquidity arrangements, both in normal and crisis times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.14,0)">If a clearing house believed that it could easily and readily access central bank liquidity, this would weaken its incentives to make the necessary arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.05,0)">Of course, there can be cases where all the necessary arrangements have been made but the CCP is facing losses beyond what was predicted and needs temporary liquidity support while remaining solvent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In that case, this option will be available and there should be no technical obstacles to using it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But there can be no commitment from the central bank to provide liquidity, and that’s a basic principle of central banks in general, not only for CCPs but for banks as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.68,0)">In sum, while some of these tools appear more appropriate than others, all of them imply drawbacks, and authorities will need to proceed cautiously if they favour one over another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">CPMI-IOSCO is currently reviewing existing CCP recovery mechanisms, including loss allocation tools, and will consider developing more granular standards for CCP recovery planning if that is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.54,0)">However, even enhanced recovery tools may not be enough to prevent the CCP from being resolved, first of all because it is impossible to estimate ex ante the size of potential uncovered exposures, secondly because under certain circumstances it might be preferable to resolve a CCP – especially if the market has lost confidence in this CCP as a going concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Effective CCP resolution as an ultimate tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.94,0)">Lastly, we need to assess whether more assurances are needed so that a CCP can be effectively resolved and can re-launch its viable operations, and whether the measures discussed before are either ineffective or out of line with market preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Much like recovery frameworks, CCP resolution frameworks are currently being designed and implemented across jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The FSB is reviewing CCP resolution regimes and resolution planning arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Based on this review, it may develop minimum standards for CCP resolution planning, strategies and tools without resorting to a government bailout, and without resulting in contagion to other parts of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Meanwhile, the European Commission is preparing specific EU legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">If, after an in-depth assessment, authorities come to the conclusion that an additional source of financial resources is needed, what form should these extra funds take?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.57,0)">Let me first reiterate that any bailout of CCPs with public money should be categorically excluded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Resolution plans should fully allocate losses to CCPs and their participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Having clarified this point, I can potentially see four main ways of increasing resolution capacity: The first would be to increase the amount of regulatory capital held by CCPs, and explicitly ring-fence a share of this capital as a means to recapitalise a new entity in a resolution scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In the EU, CCPs are required to hold sufficient own resources to cover operating costs over a six-month period – this requirement could be strengthened, not only in order to cover for a potential wind-down, but also to meet the funding costs of a new entity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">For the reasons described above, I believe there would be important drawbacks in relying only on CCPs to increase their regulatory capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">CCPs should provide a proportional contribution to the resolution process, but should not bear all the costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">A second policy option could be to make use of initial margin haircutting as a means to fund the resolution process and establish a new CCP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">While this would provide CCPs with significant resources, mutualised across the entire clearing membership, and could provide a base for re-launching a viable CCP with some degree of certainty over the sharing of losses, it would also imply a significant change in the way clearing members understand their liabilities towards the CCP – indeed, in certain jurisdictions, initial margin currently has to be bankruptcy-remote.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.3,0)">It would be difficult to predict the potential pro-cyclical effects resulting from this tool, as well as the effects on incentives for members to take part in central clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As a result, this tool should be carefully considered for resolution scenarios, and should perhaps be ruled out of the recovery toolkit altogether.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">A third option would be to set up a cross-CCP resolution fund, much like the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Single Resolution Mechanism recently established for banks in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This fund would be financed by risk-based contributions from CCPs and clearing members, but could also be financed by other stakeholders who may benefit   from the risk-management services provided by CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.43,0)">While this idea is conceptually appealing, it may be very demanding to implement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.97,0)">Such a resolution fund would need to be established on a cross-jurisdictional basis, which implies significant coordination challenges, and it would have to be phased in over a large number of years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I frankly don’t see the political momentum for such a solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">A fourth option would be for each CCP to establish its own dedicated recapitalisation fund, funded mainly by clearing members, with a proportional contribution from the CCP itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The recourse to this recapitalisation fund would certainly create many challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The resolution authority must be able to identify certain clearing services which are still viable, and these must be insulated from the losses affecting the non-viable clearing services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">However, if we are to go in the direction of new requirements for CCP resolution, I believe this could be a promising avenue to explore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Should additional pre-funded capital or liquidity resources be needed for cases of resolution, this will have to be shared in a fair way among all relevant stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Global coordination and consistency is therefore important in order to ensure a level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Looking beyond the debate on CCP loss-absorbing resources, we should keep in mind that there are other key questions regarding resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Indeed, the success of a resolution process will not only depend on whether the CCP has adequate resources, but also on whether it is actually resolvable  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.73,0)">This will depend to a large extent on the operation and design of the CCP being resolved – e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">whether its viable clearing activities are insulated from losses from the non-viable ones through separated default management silos.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It will also depend on whether or not positions from the CCP which undergo resolution can be successfully transferred to another entity in a safe and timely manner, via an interoperability link or some other means.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Further analysis will probably be required regarding the means to facilitate the porting of positions in a resolution scenario, in order to guarantee substitutability across CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.76,0)">Another issue to consider is the extent to which resolution authorities should be able to impose a temporary stay on early termination rights for CCP participants, which may be normally triggered upon the entry of the CCP into resolution  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This topic will surely feature prominently in the discussions on the implementation of CCP resolution regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In sum, debates regarding the appropriate level of CCP resources should not prevent us from addressing other crucial issues linked to resolvability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Keeping the systemic perspective in sight I have repeatedly made the point that increasing the level of financial resources available to CCPs requires careful consideration, in view of the potential costs for all relevant stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.56,0)">I believe it may also be necessary to examine the effects of any additional CCP requirements on the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">First and foremost, it will be important to ensure that incentives for central clearing are not negatively affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.64,0)">Efforts by authorities to strengthen the robustness of the financial system would be compromised if additional funding costs were to push participants away from CCPs and back into the bilateral world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It will therefore be crucial to ensure consistency between new rules affecting CCP loss absorption and the collateral regime for bilateral trades, and the capital regime for banks’ exposures to CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.57,0)">More generally, in recent months, market participants have expressed concerns that, due to the significant amount of new regulation being discussed and implemented worldwide, it is sometimes hard to get a full picture of the regulatory architecture currently being set up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">I therefore believe it is important for authorities to continue to work together, as they have done since the crisis, and to assess the combined effects of global regulation on the market and on incentives to mitigate risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">An example of this type of cooperation is the work carried out by the OTC Derivatives Assessment Team, which brings together representatives of several regulatory committees, and which published a report in 2014 examining the incentives for central clearing in the current regulatory landscape  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Part of this work will involve looking at how regulations applied to CCPs interact with those applied to other entities in the financial system, namely banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Thanks to the work being carried out by CPMI-IOSCO on stress testing and margins, we are beginning to get a better picture of how risks are being managed across the whole CCP landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In my view, an important step for the future will be to put together CCP stress testing and the stress testing carried out by big global banks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.34,0)">Authorities, CCPs and market participants need to assess the extent to which banks will be able to absorb losses passed on to them by a CCP, and how a recovery or resolution process will affect the banking system  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In this respect, authorities will need to pay particular attention to pro-cyclicality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.22,0)">As already mentioned, many of the proposed instruments to increase CCP loss absorption will have a significant cost for clearing members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.25,0)">We need to be aware that, very often, these costs will arise during a stressed market situation, when clearing members may already be facing significant liquidity pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Authorities responsible for CCPs and those responsible for banks should try and work towards a common understanding on pro-cyclicality, in order to ensure consistency in their regulatory actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Lastly, I believe we also need to move towards a more systemic view of the interconnections between CCPs and clearing members, namely via the channel of indirect participation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The PFMI already require CCPs to identify, monitor and manage material risks arising from tiered participation arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Here too, the CCP authorities and banking authorities should join forces and get a broader picture of this issue, making use of the available data and developing network analyses  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">CPMI-IOSCO together with the BCBS and FSB will soon launch joint analytical work in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Conclusion I have made the case that the global regulatory agenda implemented since the crisis has made CCPs considerably safer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">If these requirements are applied consistently, significant improvements to CCP loss-absorbing capacities may not be required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">CPMI and IOSCO are currently reviewing CCP risk-management practices on a global scale and will identify any areas where greater consistency or granularity is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">If the need did arise for further loss-absorption capacities, we will have to make sure any new requirements provide the right incentives for CCPs and their members, offer authorities a certain degree of flexibility and do not create disincentives for central clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Whether we choose to bolster the tools for CCP resilience, CCP recovery or CCP resolution, we will need to be aware of potential trade-offs in the way losses are allocated, and remember that there may be no ideal approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I have provided an overview of the pros and cons of these various approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It will be crucial not to lose sight of the systemic view when discussing CCP loss absorption, and to pay close attention to the interconnections between CCP exposures and bank exposures, and to the impact of CCP risk-management on pro-cyclicality in the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">I look forward to learning from our discussions today and I hope they will shed new light on some of the trade-offs I have identified.</span>
