    <span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)"> Policy coordination in a multipolar world Remarks by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 5th annual Cusco conference organised by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru and the Reinventing Bretton Woods Committee: "70 years after Bretton Woods: Managing the interconnectedness of the world economy",Cusco, 22 July 2014 Dear Governor Velarde, dear Marc Uzan, ladies and gentlemen,   I would like to thank the organisers for giving me the opportunity to share some thoughts with you on the changes in the international monetary system   and the role of monetary policy coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.15,0)">History casts a long shadow over the IMS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Over the past three decades, however, the global economy has changed in decisive ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Three aspects are particularly striking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">First, financial factors have become an increasingly relevant source of cross-country interlinkages, with some evidence of cross-country de-linkages since the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Second, emerging economies have raised their clout, as reflected by the impact of their business cycles on global growth and the growing use of their currencies: the global economy has become multipolar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And third, monetary policy in advanced economies has – more recently – entered new territory by resorting to unconventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I would like to outline these shifts in the global economic landscape, and then elaborate on the implications for the IMS and monetary policy coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Three structural shifts in the global economy Globalisation, home bias and regionalisation Clearly, the defining feature of the last three decades has been the dramatic strengthening of globalisation in both trade and finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Cross-border trade in goods and services as well as investment has soared, driven by trade-liberalising policies, the lifting of capital controls as well as innovations in transport and information technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.79,0)">The global financial crisis has led to a halt in this trend, perhaps only temporarily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But there is also the possibility of a step backwards, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">a re-emergence of financial home bias and a stronger drive towards regionalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Early evidence of this is the resurgence of the so-called “Feldstein-Horioka puzzle”, that is, a sharp rise in the correlation between savings and investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.87,0)">European banks have retreated from dollar-denominated lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Banks from emerging economies also have a stronger regional orientation, in particular in South-East Asia, Central America and the Commonwealth of Independent States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.12,0)">Regulators have been tempted to ring-fence their domestic financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.61,0)">Restrictions on intra-European cross-border liquidity flows or the US rules for foreign banking organisations may be seen as examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.85,0)">Such a “de-globalisation” scenario, if confirmed, could become self-validating and have profound effects on the degree of international risk-sharing, spillovers and the global allocation of savings, and therefore on global long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Shifting economic centre of gravity Since the early 2000s the world has also witnessed impressive growth rates in emerging economies, which have exceeded those in the advanced world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In particular the BRICS   have more than doubled their share of global GDP from less than 10% in 2000 to 21% in 2013; similarly, other low and middle-income economies have seen their share increase from 7% in 2000 to 12% in 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">The rise of emerging economies is also illustrated by the eastward shift of the world’s economic centre of gravity, which is occurring at a faster speed than ever before in human history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">And the shift towards a multipolar world is in turn reflected in changes to global institutions and fora, as evidenced by the switch in relative importance between the G7 and the G20, and the ongoing governance reforms at the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In line with the shift in economic centre of gravity, the currency constellation in the IMS may also be gradually changing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">In particular in light of the remarkable growth of China’s economy and recent policy measures adopted by its authorities, the international use of the renminbi has gained momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">And China’s plans to liberalise its capital account as well as to increase exchange rate flexibility and develop domestic financial markets will enhance the role of the renminbi as an international reserve currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Some analysts believe that, over time, it can reach international currency status, alongside the US dollar and the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We would then enter an era of a tri-polar IMS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Unconventional monetary policy Before the global financial crisis the widespread adoption of explicit price stability objectives had been conducive to prolonged low inflation outcomes alongside economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Major central banks were content to invoke the Tinbergen principle, aiming to achieve their primary objective of price stability through a single monetary policy instrument: short-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.93,0)">The global financial crisis changed this setting abruptly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Pursuing central bank mandates in a zero lower-bound environment has meant that monetary policy needed to broaden the set of policy instruments at its disposal, including forward guidance and asset purchases by central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As a result of the latter, the balance sheets of all major central banks have increased significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">One of the major challenges in the years ahead will be the differentiated normalisation of unconventional monetary policies in advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Many have argued that in this process central banks in advanced economies should be mindful of the spillovers to the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">There have even been calls for a fundamental strengthening of international monetary policy coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I would like to take this opportunity to elaborate on my views on this discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.53,0)">The debate on international monetary policy coordination There are different proposals on how the IMS should change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In particular, there have been several calls to establish a more formal framework of monetary policy coordination, or some kind of revised Bretton Woods system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Overall, I will argue that the forces which are at play today in the IMS, as described above, call for a strengthening of some of its features rather than an overhaul.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Theory First, while the literature suggests that international monetary policy coordination may be instrumental in achieving a globally optimal solution, it generally concludes that the gains from coordination are small relative to an environment in which national policy-makers pursue optimal domestic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Second, it is not clear that the benefits from coordination increase monotonically with economic and financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">On the one hand, financial integration intensifies the impact of foreign shocks on the domestic economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">On the other hand, it also improves diversification and insurance opportunities, hence mitigating the impact of foreign shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.28,0)">It is difficult to know ex ante which of these effects will dominate both in “normal” and “crisis” times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">My suggestion would be that while the diversification effect dominates in “normal” times, in “crisis” times the effects from large adverse spillovers prevail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.56,0)">I will come back to this issue later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.98,0)">Practical obstacles There are also several practical challenges that make more explicit and binding forms of monetary policy coordination difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The first stems from political economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Central banks operate under different mandates, time horizons, objectives and accountability arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">They are ultimately backed by their domestic fiscal authority and report to their domestic parliament  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.3,0)">As a consequence, they cannot act as lenders of last resort other than in a discretionary way beyond the boundaries of their political constituencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.0,0)">In addition, economic cycles do not always coincide across countries, which creates tensions between what is needed for domestic purposes and what is optimal from an international perspective  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.55,0)">Finally, given that uncertainty is pervasive in economic policy-making, developing a common assessment of global risks and spillovers will always be difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.54,0)">This considerably complicates consensus-building concerning the design and enforcement of policies that countries should implement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.8,0)">Take, for example, the pre-crisis debate on the risks stemming from global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.49,0)">The current account deficit in the United States was seen by some as problematic, as they believed it would eventually trigger a balance of payments crisis or a sudden and strong depreciation of the US dollar with global ramifications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Others instead argued that the current account deficit was not of concern given the international status of the US dollar; the positive valuation effects and the positive net foreign income balance were seen as evidence that the current account deficit in the US was sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.58,0)">As a matter of fact, we did not experience a US balance of payments crisis, even though we did experience a spectacular global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.04,0)">What was the connection between global imbalances and the global financial crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.25,0)">What were the drivers of those global imbalances?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.85,0)">The debate has still not been settled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.08,0)">Similarly, I would claim that the main obstacle today to international monetary policy coordination is the lack of consensus on   the degree of slack in the labour and product markets of the major economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Reaching a consensus on the nature of spillovers is not straightforward either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Most models of international monetary policy coordination assume that policy-makers are able to identify the types of shock and how they are transmitted to the domestic and global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.29,0)">But this is often not the case in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.64,0)">For instance, there have been marked differences in the views on the global impact of Federal Reserve announcements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.54,0)">On the one hand, some have argued that the Fed’s monetary policy is driving a global financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.2,0)">On the other hand, others have argued that the key driving forces of capital flows are global risk and uncertainty, with a much looser connection to US monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.12,0)">Another example of diverging views concerns the question of whether emerging economies have the tools to neutralise the spillovers originating from other parts of the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.75,0)">As a result of our poor understanding of the types of shock and their transmission, establishing which policy responses are the best for each country seems to be rather difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.6,0)">Internalising the effects of one’s monetary policy on other jurisdictions would be even more challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.33,0)">Suppose the Fed had a mandate to internalise the global impact of its decisions, which it does not have, would the financial stability impact of cheap dollar funding in emerging market economies have called for a later, or for an earlier, normalisation of US monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Ultimately, there is necessarily a high degree of subjective judgement involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.3,0)">As I already suggested, crisis times such as 2008-2009 are the exception, since the spillovers are at the same time less ambiguous and more visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.1,0)">The scope of coordination This does not imply that regular dialogues between central banks as well as exchanges of views during meetings at the IMF, the BIS, the G20 and at regional level, are not useful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In fact, I believe that it is quite the contrary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Global institutions and fora play an essential role for three reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">First, they achieve a better understanding and a common assessment of the global spillovers from domestic policy actions and the potential policy trade-offs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The discussion on capital flow management measures is a good example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The IMF should continue to lend its analytical and impartial voice to this effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Second, even if the scope for coordination is limited in good times, they make coordination possible in bad times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Consider, for example, the establishment of a system of bilateral swap agreements among major advanced economy central banks, or the recent decision to establish such an agreement between the ECB and the People’s Bank of China.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Third, they prompt work at bodies such as the Basel Committee for Banking Supervision, the International Organization of Securities Commission or the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems, to establish the standards and infrastructures and create a level playing field, which are necessary for global markets to function in a smooth and safe way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In so doing, they foster risk-sharing through decentralised markets, avoiding the need to coordinate in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Against the background of the possible “deglobalisation” forces that I mentioned earlier, and given the ongoing transition to a more multipolar currency system, this work may become even more crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To summarise, I am not convinced that the existing approach to monetary policy coordination should be fundamentally overhauled at the current juncture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.97,0)">Due to knowledge and legitimacy gaps, we should not believe that there can be a “global planner” which sets the rules or prescribes the monetary, prudential, fiscal and structural policies that each country shall pursue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">However, countries can and should maintain the foundations for coordination to make global markets a safer place and allow for joint action in times of crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The evolution of the IMS The IMS during the Bretton Woods era was strictly rules-based with fixed exchange rates and a gold standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.4,0)">While appropriate in a world with capital controls and relatively modest trade flows, it proved to be too inflexible in the presence of large idiosyncratic shocks and growing internationalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The end of the Bretton Woods era gave rise to an IMS that is mostly based on principles, which are discussed in fora such as the G7, G20 or the OECD and BIS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In particular, one principle holds that multilateral financial safety nets should be available to countries facing large financial market disruptions caused by major external shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Like any insurance-providing scheme, the IMS is incentives-based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The incentives for any economy to access the IMF’s credit lines, bilateral swap agreements or regional balance of payment support facilities depend on the conditionality embedded in each of these mechanisms, as well as on the degree of self-insurance acquired by this economy, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">through foreign exchange reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.92,0)">The problem here is that conditionality is not always explicit, nor is it consistent across instruments, providing a fuzzy set of incentives – and therefore a bias towards self-insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This may create arbitrage opportunities across facilities   and, ultimately, a bias towards self-insurance, a sub-optimal way to deliver global stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">There is scope for improving the consistency of these facilities both horizontally across institutions and vertically between the global and regional level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">A different set of incentives stems from the surveillance carried out by the IMF and other institutions and fora.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This has taken place since the demise of the Bretton Woods system at the bilateral level in the context of the IMF’s Article IV consultations and it has expanded recently at the multilateral level with the IMF’s Spillover and External Sector Reports as well as the G20 Mutual Assessment Process, not to mention regional exercises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.57,0)">The resulting recommendations are however not binding and therefore constitute only a light form of multilateralism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.37,0)">Clearly, countries may be reluctant to submit to closer scrutiny, fearing that the recommended policies may not be in their national interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Thus, better awareness and maintaining a spirit of multilateralism will be a crucial element in strengthening the effectiveness of surveillance and contributing to global stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This requires institutions that are both legitimate and effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.41,0)">In particular, lack of progress in global governance reform   would fuel a lack of trust in the IMS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.5,0)">It would encourage the ring-fencing of national systems and the re-nationalisation of savings, harming growth and jobs in all economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.02,0)">The belief that the comfortable pre-crisis world could return is long gone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And I also believe that we should not aspire to turn the clock back.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">The global economy has changed fundamentally, and there is clearly a greater understanding of the role of cross-border linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The current IMS leaves countries with more domestic policy options to counter adverse idiosyncratic shocks than the inflexible system of the Bretton Woods era.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">At the same time, in a highly interlinked global economy consensus-building concerning the transmission of spillovers is crucial for dealing with shocks that affect substantial parts of the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Moreover, the IMS should also provide incentives to foster appropriate preventive action that renders economies more resilient to shocks, and provide the necessary standards and infrastructures to make global markets work better as well as make coordination possible when warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">This is already a robust policy agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">I would like to thank Michele Ca’ Zorzi and G. Georgiadis for contributing to these remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I remain solely responsible for the opinions expressed herein.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.85,0)">For euro area countries the cross-country correlation between the savings and investment-to-GDP ratios fell continuously from 0.6 in the early 1990s to essentially zero in 2005; similarly, for non-euro area OECD countries it even fell from almost one to zero over the same time span.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">After the global financial crisis the correlation rose sharply to 0.6 for the euro area and 0.75 for non-euro area OECD countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">, Scharfstein, D.S., Stein J.C.  , “ Dollar Funding and the Lending Behavior of Global Banks”, NBER Working Paper No 18528, November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">This has been particularly visible in the rise of the renminbi as an invoicing and settlement currency for China’s international trade: while in 2010 almost none of China’s trade in goods and services was invoiced in renminbi, in 2014 this figure has risen to almost 25%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Similarly, the issuance of renminbi-denominated   bonds has grown by a factor of about 30, albeit from a very low level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For a discussion of the international role of the renminbi, see Eichengreen, B., and Kawai M.  , “ Issues for renminbi internationalization: an overview," Asian Development Bank Institute Working Paper, No 454, January.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">On recent trends in the IMS, see the latest ECB Report on the International Role of the Euro, Frankfurt am Main, 16 July 2014.     , “ A step in the dark: unconventional monetary policy after the crisis”, Andrew Crockett Memorial Lecture, BIS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">, and Rogoff, K.  , “ Global implications of self-oriented national monetary rules,” Quarterly Journal of Economics,   503-35.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This may partly also depend on the model set-up characterised by limited policy trade-offs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Cœuré  , keynote address at the ECB-IMF conference on the “ International dimension of conventional and unconventional monetary policy,” Frankfurt am Main, 30 April 2014, forthcoming in a special issue of the Journal of International Money and Finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Eichengreen  , “ A Requiem for Global Imbalances”, Project Syndicate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Rey  , “ Dilemma not trilemma: the global cycle and monetary policy independence”, Proceedings - Economic Policy Symposium - Jackson Hole, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, pp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">1-2.    and Warnock, F.  , “ Capital flow waves: Surges, stops, flight, and retrenchment”, Journal of International Economics, vol.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.88,0)">88 , pp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.09,0)">235-251.</span>
