    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> The international role of the euro Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBdelivered at the “Schierensee Gespräche”, 14 May 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Introduction It is with particular pleasure I address this distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Today, I will look beyond the confines of the single currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I will even go beyond the borders of the Baltic Sea region to which Minister-President Simonis has just referred, as I would like to share with you some thoughts on the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">When the euro was launched on 1 January 1999, the European Central Bank   assumed responsibility for monetary policy in the euro area – the second largest economic area in the world after the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The Eurosystem subsequently became the issuer of the second most widely used international currency, after the US dollar and ahead of the Japanese yen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.95,0)">This outcome was mainly a reflection of the legacy of the 12 former national currencies which the euro replaced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Since the euro came into being, its international role has grown in a gradual but steady way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In that vein, I will first review the main developments in more detail, by characterising the key features of the use of the euro by non-euro area residents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I will then turn to the role of the euro and the Eurosystem in international cooperation on currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">This role is also reflected in our policy position vis-à-vis the internationalisation of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The ECB sees the internationalisation of its currency beyond the borders of the euro area as a market-driven process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">At the same time, the ECB also analyses developments closely, as we are keen to know how our currency is used and by whom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This applies in particular to the use of the euro in countries located in the immediate vicinity of the euro area, including the new EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">As you know, these countries are expected to adopt the euro in due course once they are deemed to have fulfilled the conditions set out in the EU Treaty, and I will briefly comment on this process in my conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The gradual development of the international role of the euro Let us consider first the main developments in the international use of the euro since its inception in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To briefly sketch the main traits, I will follow the standard approach that builds on the functions of money and distinguishes between the varied use of the euro outside the euro area, by public authorities on the one hand and private agents on the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.22,0)">Let me start with public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">There are about 50 countries with an exchange rate regime linked to the euro, including those EU Member States that have not yet joined the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Non-EU countries that use the euro as an anchor currency are mainly located in the EU’s neighbouring regions or are countries that have established special institutional arrangements with the EU or some of the EU Member States, like the CFA zone in Africa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In most of these countries, the euro is also the main or the sole intervention currency used by the authorities to stabilise the exchange rates of their respective currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Additionally, in these countries euro-denominated assets account for a substantial share of the foreign exchange reserves held by the respective authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Globally, at the end of 2002, the euro’s share in foreign exchange reserve assets was close to one-fifth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Turning to private users, the internationalisation of the euro has been most visible in global capital markets, in particular when it comes to the role of the euro as an international financing currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Since the start of Stage Three of EMU, the stock of euro-denominated debt securities issued by non-euro area residents has risen by around EUR 800 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This represents an increase in the share of the euro in the stock of international bonds from around 20% in 1999 to more than 30% in 2003, while the share of dollar-denominated bonds has remained stable at around 45%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">A significant share of euro-denominated securities have been targeted at, and purchased by, euro area investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">In using the euro as an issuance currency, financial institutions and corporations, mainly from mature economies, most notably the United States and the United Kingdom, have taken advantage of the greater size and liquidity provided by the increasingly integrated euro-denominated bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Besides the international financial markets, there is also evidence that the euro is increasingly being used as a settlement or invoicing currency in euro area countries’ trade with non-euro area residents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">For example, the share of the euro in the settlement and invoicing of Spain’s extra-euro area exports rose from 49% in 2000 to close to 58% in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Similar increases were recorded for France and for Belgium and Luxembourg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The use of the euro was most pronounced in settling and invoicing trade with the so-called “pre-ins”  , the new EU Member States, and even Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.61,0)">However, there is also evidence of inertia in some of the facets of the euro’s international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The share of the euro in foreign exchange transactions today has not significantly augmented in comparison with the previous national currencies, accounting for about one-fifth to one-quarter of all daily transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">By way of comparison, the US dollar is used in more than forty percent of foreign exchange transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">There are several factors explaining why some of the facets of a currency’s international use are characterised by a high degree of stability rather than gradual change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.74,0)">The most prominent ones are what economists usually call “dynamic economies of scale” and “network externalities”, which tend to freeze existing situations into steady states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Hence, any shift from the use of one currency to another currency would require a significant and exogenous shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.37,0)">The foreign exchange market is one example; the invoicing of raw materials, such as oil, is another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The euro and international cooperation on currencies To sum up, the euro has been firmly and credibly established as the world’s second international currency during the first five years of Monetary Union, and its gradually increased use in several market segments highlights the degree of confidence non-euro area residents have in the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">But the advent of the euro did not only involve the development of its international use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.13,0)">It also affected global policy cooperation, including cooperation on exchange rate issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In this regard, it should be reiterated that the ECB and the Eurogroup share the responsibility for exchange rate consultation with third parties – for example at G7 level – and for communication policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.61,0)">At the same time, the ECB is solely responsible for decisions on foreign exchange operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In this way we give the euro area a single voice in international fora on exchange rate-related issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">In particular, we see the G7 as one of the major platforms for a reciprocal exchange of information and views on macroeconomic and exchange rate developments at global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Cooperation is important given the interlinkages between economic areas in today’s globalised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">On the present exchange rates I will only say that the appropriate terms of reference are in the two last communiqués of the G7, in Boca Raton and Washington, where we reiterated exactly the same wording which captured very well our present consensus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.6,0)">Against this background, I would say that the relationship between the two most widely used international currencies, the US dollar and the euro, should not be perceived as a zero-sum game, where a gain for one currency means a loss for the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">On the contrary, given the extent to which international goods and financial markets are integrated, there are net benefits from the “coexistence” of the US dollar and the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">International investors can reduce risk by diversifying their asset portfolio, commodity traders can easily make international contracts using one of these two currencies as a numeraire.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">And all of them can trust the single monetary policy which, through its pursuit of price stability, safeguards the purchasing power of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The ECB and the international role of the euro This brings me to the policy approach adopted by the Eurosystem on the internationalisation of its currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I will start by emphasising a key characteristic of the international use of any currency, namely that – contrary to its domestic use – it has no institutional foundations, as there is no “sovereign” power that can enforce its use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is why the international use of a currency is, in essence, a market-driven process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The main economic factors underpinning the internationalisation of a currency are well known.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The first factor is domestic stability, that is a low inflation rate, making the currency attractive as a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The second factor is a high degree of openness to international trade and finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is a key determinant for the currency’s use as a medium of exchange and a unit of account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">And the third factor is a developed financial system with deep and liquid markets offering participants a wide range of services and products in terms of borrowing, investing and hedging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Against this background, the Eurosystem takes a neutral stance on the internationalisation of its currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This means that we neither hinder nor actively promote the development of this role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.08,0)">For example, with the exception of the concept of ERM II to which I will refer in a moment, decisions taken by non-euro area authorities to use the euro as an anchor, reserve or intervention currency have to be fully seen as unilateral measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.36,0)">They do not involve any commitment on the part of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">At the same time, the Eurosystem contributes to the international role of the euro in indirect ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Price stability is a key precondition for the development of the international role of a currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Thus, the stability-oriented monetary policy of the ECB contributes to the euro’s potential for expanding its international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">In this context, I would also like to stress the importance of the credibility of the overall policy framework, including the need for clear and enforceable fiscal rules and structural reforms in labour and goods markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The Eurosystem has also been a strong supporter of financial market integration in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The introduction of the euro itself has undoubtedly led to a deeper and more integrated financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The evidence strongly suggests that this has supported the development of the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">And when we refer to the fact that potential gains from monetary union will only be fully realised when European financial integration is fully achieved, this also applies to the euro’s use as an international financing and investment currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Let me stress that by being neutral we are not indifferent to the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Indeed, we pay special attention to the international use of our currency and provide regular information to the public on related developments in the international financial arena, for example the recent build-up in foreign exchange reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">From a monetary policy perspective, the international role of the euro does not provide any specific implications or challenges per se.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.54,0)">However, we are closely monitoring developments which might have an impact on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The demand for euro banknotes abroad is an example, even though currency in circulation represents only 6.5% of the monetary aggregate M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Currently, there is evidence suggesting that non-euro area residents hold about 10% of the total amount of euro currency in circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This amount is roughly in line with estimates of the amount of euro legacy currencies circulating outside the euro area prior to the cash changeover in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The adoption of the euro by non-euro area EU Member States I have already referred to the fact that the international role of the euro is most prominent in the EU’s neighbouring regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Indeed, it is in these regions where the relationship between the ECB’s pursuit of a stability-oriented monetary policy and the euro’s international use has been most visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">By granting monetary stability to an economic area that is by far the largest trading partner of our neighbours, the euro has helped anchor policies in the region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">It has prevented a mismatch between trade and financial links and provided clear guidance to one of the most profound processes of economic transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The anchoring effect has been most pronounced with regard to the ten new Member States that joined the Union two weeks ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">But let me also mention, en passant, that the EU’s links with the Western Balkans, the Mediterranean countries and the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States, notably Russia, have strengthened as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">In line with this, we have also observed significant use of the euro by public authorities and private agents in these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me now turn to the ten new EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">For the moment, any use of the euro by authorities and private agents in these countries – as in Denmark, Sweden and the United Kingdom – continues to be an “international” one, as the euro is still being used there by non-euro area residents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">However, unlike Denmark and the United Kingdom, the ten new Member States have not asked to opt out of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Thus, they will adopt the euro once they have fulfilled the requirements as laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">This entails that, on their road to the euro, they will, at some point, join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">ERM II is a multilateral arrangement of fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates with a central rate and a standard fluctuation band of (15% against the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.53,0)">Thus, under ERM II, the official use of the euro in its role as an anchor currency by some non-euro area EU Member States will no longer represent a unilateral decision by the respective authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Rather, it will be based on a multilateral agreement between the Member State concerned, the euro area member countries, the ECB and the other Member States participating in the mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is most evident with regard to the decisions on central rates, as they are taken by mutual agreement of the various parties to ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.15,0)">Moreover, several exchange rate regimes are incompatible with ERM II participation, including pegs against anchors other than the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The new Member States differ greatly in terms of their economic structures, current exchange rates and monetary regimes, and in the degree of nominal and real convergence already achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Thus, no single path towards ERM II and the adoption of the euro can be identified and recommended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Rather, a case-by-case approach – based on the principle of equal treatment – will be followed, in line with the stipulations laid down in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This includes the criteria concerning the sustainability of nominal convergence, better known as the “Maastricht criteria”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There will be no additional criteria but there will be no relaxation of the criteria either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">We are aware that the road to the euro will be demanding, with participation in ERM II being only one element of the overall policy framework in the process towards full monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In a document published at the end of last year, the Governing Council set out in detail the principles which will guide the prospective participation of new Member States in ERM II and later their adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Once these countries are deemed to have fulfilled the conditions set by the Treaty, they will adopt the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">By definition this will mark the end of the “international” role of the euro in these countries and lay the groundwork for a fully fledged “domestic” role of the single currency there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In the years ahead, we will work hard to ensure that this process of fully integrating new Member States into our common monetary area will unfold smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Over the last few years we prepared intensively for enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Now it is time to reap the mutual benefits of a wider Union, in particular with the expanded internal market providing new opportunities for trade and investment flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">This can have a significantly positive impact on growth in the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">I am convinced that, with enlargement, prosperity will increase and living standards improve across the whole Union.</span>
