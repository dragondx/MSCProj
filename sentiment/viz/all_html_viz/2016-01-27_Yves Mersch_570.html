    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)"> Current developments in the German banking market Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at an event organised by the Bayerischer Sparkassenverband,Munich, 27 January 2016 Dear Mr Strohmaier  , Ladies and Gentlemen, You have invited me to speak about “Current developments in the German banking market”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Allow me to say right at the beginning, not just in my official capacity as a representative of the European Central Bank  , that a national banking market in a monetary union must be seen in the context of the monetary union as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Therefore, I will first address the position of banks in the euro area in general, and then speak about the specific situation of German banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Resilience of European banks strengthened despite continued weakness of earnings European banks are significantly more resilient than they were five years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">They have strengthened their capital base and reduced their debts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The large, complex banking groups still have some catching up to do in this area, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Credit risks vis-à-vis emerging economies in Asia are limited as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.88,0)">In the past two years, fewer than 2% of European banks’ loans have been accounted for by this region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">That is why I expect that the weakened economic situation there will lead, at most, to limited losses for European banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.02,0)">What is more problematic is the increased interest rate risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.49,0)">Since last spring we have seen greater volatility in interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.97,0)">Rises in interest rates could lead to immediate valuation losses on debt portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.37,0)">For example, systemically important banks currently have to value around one-quarter of their fixed-rate debt securities at market prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The earnings position of European banks has recently improved somewhat – primarily because of higher shares of non-interest related earnings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.37,0)">But in the current weak economic environment, and in view of low interest rates, earnings are still low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.94,0)">The interest rate margin is narrow and has been falling continuously for almost 20 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.03,0)">Portfolios of non-performing loans are also depressing earnings prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.14,0)">This applies above all in countries which were particularly badly hit by the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Here, there is a need for policymakers and others to accelerate the reduction of these legacy assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">By, for example, ensuring that judicial systems work more efficiently and that insolvency laws comply with international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.52,0)">It would be simplistic to attribute the weak earnings only to market factors outside the influence of bank managers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.9,0)">Many European banks continue to have very high administrative costs, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And something could certainly be done about that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It is my expectation that interest income will play a less important role in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This is also a reason why there are prospects of rising earnings for Europe’s banks, namely if they succeed in adjusting their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.5,0)">Some may argue that the tighter regulation of the banking sector is weighing heavily on some banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">No one disputes that we do not need “regulation for the sake of regulation”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Neither is it about shackling market participants unnecessarily; rather, an adequate regulatory framework can create room for manoeuvre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">That’s because regulation which ensures more stability and reduces information asymmetries and other destabilising factors helps secure freedom of choice for market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To meet this objective, regulators must continually review whether the existing rules are proportionate to current and future expected risks in the financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Banks should adjust to this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Just as the situation in the financial markets changes – think, for example, of financial innovation – so too does the need for regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">That was why, in the light of the recent financial crisis, it was necessary to adapt the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But I would not call it a “regulation tsunami” in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.47,0)">Many banks have held too little capital to be able to survive a large economic shock unscathed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Accordingly, banks are now required to have larger and higher quality buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This also serves to protect the tax payer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">And it has proven successful: European banks – thanks to higher Tier 1 capital ratios – have become more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.79,0)">The financial crisis also showed that panic situations can very quickly lead to liquidity shortages in the interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">That is why sufficient liquidity buffers are necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">These buffers are the liquidity coverage ratio   and the net stable funding ratio  , the latter being the structural liquidity ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.43,0)">I am aware that the prospect of new rules can lead to uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And I know that it is not always easy for you to deal with this uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">In the meantime, however, you have significantly more planning certainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">What were until recently loose guidelines are now becoming concrete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">It is clear, for example, that Deutsche Bank, as a global systemically important bank, has to hold an additional capital buffer   of 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In addition, it will soon be clear which banks will be subject to stronger requirements in the future, as the Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht   will shortly decide which banks will be counted as other systemically important institutions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Moreover, BaFin has for the first time set the countercyclical capital buffer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.34,0)">This has been 0% since the beginning of the month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.93,0)">The buffer will now be reviewed every quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB can demand a higher buffer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">At the moment, however, we agree with BaFin’s judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">These examples of implementation in Germany bring me to the second part of my speech – the situation in the German banking market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Relatively solid situation of German banks is no reason for complacency The German banking sector is, in absolute terms, the largest in the monetary union alongside the French one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In 2014 the total assets of German banks amounted to almost €6.8 trillion  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That corresponds to roughly 250% of Germany’s gross domestic product   and 28% of the total assets in the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In Germany there is also a comparatively large number of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.1,0)">If we leave out the branches of foreign banks in Germany, there are around 1,700 credit institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">That constitutes one-third of the total number of banks in the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In view of the size of the German banking sector alone, it plays an important role for the ECB, which is responsible for the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The German banking sector is not just relatively large, it also heterogeneous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.89,0)">Small and medium-sized banks – less significant institutions   – which include the Sparkassen  , account for around 35% of the total balance sheet of the German banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Whereas in other euro area countries the systemically relevant banks, which are directly supervised by the ECB, contribute around 80%-85% of the total assets in the respective Member State, this contribution is only around 65% in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">You yourselves are, of course, the experts on the position of small and medium-sized banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.38,0)">A survey carried out by the Bundesbank and BaFin   shows that small and medium-sized institutions, if they do not take appropriate counter-measures, can expect further substantial profit losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.67,0)">In the survey banks said that, even if interest rates rise, their profits would decline slightly in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.88,0)">If the market situation develops as the banks expect, then their profitability before taxes in the next three years would decline by around one-quarter compared with 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">And this is despite the fact that conditions in Germany are relatively favourable at the moment and banks say that they want to reduce their costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.7,0)">Assuming a negative interest rate shock of 100 basis points, income would decline by 60% to 70%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The earnings position of small and medium-sized banks – and thus also that of the savings banks – is still sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">In the medium term, however, I see some risks if long-term loans are granted at very low fixed interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.81,0)">As in the rest of the monetary union, the interest rate margin is also narrowing in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.06,0)">The large German banks are also experiencing this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Although the economic situation in Germany is significantly better than in some other Member States, these banks are hardly recording any growth in profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Under the current conditions, realising higher income is indeed a challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.18,0)">Profits, however, are the result of the difference between income and expenses, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.75,0)">costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Possibilities for making the cost structure more efficient certainly exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.8,0)">If interest margins are low over a longer period of time, business models need to be reviewed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">That means, for example, developing other sources of income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Large banks already started to do this some time ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">But Landesbanken, which have a similar business model to large banks, continue to feature a large share of low-margin interbank business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">This reduces the possibilities for strengthening the capital base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.29,0)">And smaller and regional banks have hardly adjusted their business model at all over the past 50 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">They continue to focus on regional lending to households and firms, financed by deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Small banks, especially savings banks, still play an important role in the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Not only here in Germany, but in Europe in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">However, it’s by no means certain that this will remain so; not least because the large banks have adapted their strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.68,0)">They’re scaling back their investment banking activities and focusing more on corporate clients and retail business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">This means increased competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The stability of the savings bank sector is not set in stone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Structural change is an important challenge – not only for the smaller institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">For instance, I see a need for catching up when it comes to new technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Foreign institutions use such technology to offer loans throughout Europe, and thus also in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">That adds to the competitive pressure, even if it may only apply to standardised consumer loans at first.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In addition, I wonder how Germany’s banks will respond to new market participants such as Fintech firms, and whether peer-to-peer loans will be of such importance in the future that banks will rethink their traditional business model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">If there is an increase in these and other alternatives to traditional financing via the banking sector, this may well provide incentives to push forward the consolidation urgently needed in this sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">In particular, the Landesbanken have already seen some changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.5,0)">If Germany still had 12 Landesbanken before the financial crisis, today there are only nine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.05,0)">At the same time, the balance sheet total of this group of banks has shrunk by 30%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.44,0)">Overall, the number of German credit institutions has only decreased by 10% in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.58,0)">In other Member States of the monetary union, the number of credit institutions nevertheless fell by nearly a quarter   during the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.28,0)">Not least because the overcapacity from the pre-crisis period is weighing on earnings prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Financial institutions could well profit from “creative destruction”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">After having talked at length about the difficult earnings situation, I would like to say something positive: the capital base of German banks is in a very good position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Since the beginning of 2008 their Tier 1 capital ratio has risen steadily by 6.5 percentage points – to the current level of 15.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">But the German taxpayer has also contributed to this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Between 2008 and 2013 the state provided some €144 billion in support to the German financial sector, in the form of capital injections   and relief on assets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">State guarantees were of a similar magnitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Roughly 40% – or €26 billion – of the capital increase can be attributed to the Landesbanken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.68,0)">Given the large capital buffer, even if earnings decline significantly  , I presume that there are no noteworthy risks to financial stability in this country right now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Even in a low interest rate environment, returns can be made on savings Let me touch briefly on the situation of savers, as this is a theme that repeatedly receives special attention in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.35,0)">Incidentally, German households hold only slightly more than 40% of their total financial assets as deposits with banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">That’s roughly in line with the average euro area saver – so the German saver isn’t really that special.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.81,0)">I am well aware that nominal returns on savings deposits are very low right now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.81,0)">The public debate frequently refers to the nominal interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Understandably, since financial institutions usually use nominal interest rates for marketing purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">But what is actually more important is real returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">For example, a Deutsche Bundesbank study shows that, in the last three years, the real return on households’ financial assets stood at around 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Though below the long-term average of 3.5% for the 16 years prior to the financial crisis  , that is significantly higher than 0%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.47,0)">Indeed, time and again, there were phases of negative real interest rates in the past, for example at the beginning of the 2000s and during the recent financial crisis, and also in the 1970s and at the start of the 1990s – but with significantly higher inflation rates then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">If one takes residential property assets into account, during the last five years German households have even realised a higher return than in the five years before the crisis, because of increased real estate prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For savers, ultimately, it is longer-term real interest returns that are of importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.83,0)">And they are mainly dependent on factors which we, the central bank, cannot influence on a lasting basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">For example, economic growth and the real return on physical capital play a decisive role in terms of how real interest rates develop in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Furthermore, the overall relationship between savings and investment influences real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Since the end of the 1990s, emerging countries in Asia have increased their currency reserves significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.52,0)">Accordingly, they are contributing to a global savings glut.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">People in developed economies started to save more because of aging societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.53,0)">And, over this period, real interest rates have also dropped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.6,0)">Thus, the average real interest rates for the ten-year government bonds of important industrialised countries, including Germany, fell from the   4% recorded at the middle/end of the 1990s to approximately 2% in the year 2007   – note that this was before the outbreak of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">According to survey results, Germans are presently satisfied with their financial investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Recent developments indicate that they are slowly showing renewed interest in riskier types of investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Thus, in the third quarter of last year they invested considerably more money in the capital markets than in the previous six years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.49,0)">However, they also suffered noticeable valuation losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The savings book or fixed-term deposits still remain popular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.18,0)">This underlines what studies and statistics   have long been suggesting: German savers are exceptionally risk averse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Weighing risks carefully is in itself a healthy attitude – one that is also positive for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.41,0)">But excessive caution also lowers the return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Here, I see a great opportunity for savings and cooperative banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Their strategic advantage is the proximity to customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">They can advise their customers competently and contribute to a full understanding of financial products and the risks thereof.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Concluding remarks Lastly, a brief summary: after the financial and economic crisis Europe’s banks strengthened their capital base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">That also applies to the German banking sector, the largest one in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Even if German banks are in a better position than the financial institutions of some other Member States, there is no reason for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">On the one hand, excessive costs have until now prevented the building up of additional equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.58,0)">And, on the other hand, competition in the German banking sector is likely to intensify noticeably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.3,0)">As a result of the financial crisis, some of the larger German banks are changing tack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.29,0)">They are increasingly focusing on traditional corporate clients and retail business and are scaling back investment banking activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Furthermore, technological progress is making it easier for foreign banks to gain access to the German market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.69,0)">Both the smaller and larger German banks are feeling the effects of this development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The pressure to adjust should also rise for German savings banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Even if there was hardly any need for the savings bank sector to adjust its business model in the past, its stability is not set in stone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.67,0)">Intensified competition within an environment of low interest rates over a longer time period could markedly reduce earnings in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.49,0)">In the light of lower interest margins, the traditional business models should be put under scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.51,0)">ECB  , Financial stability review, November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.21,0)">ECB  , Report on financial
