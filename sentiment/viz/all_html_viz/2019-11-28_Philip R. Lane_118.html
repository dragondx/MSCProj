    <h1> Determinants of the real interest rate </h1>
    <h2> Remarks by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the National Treasury Management Agency </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Philip R. Lane </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)"> Dublin, 28 November 2019 Determinants of the real interest rate Remarks by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the National Treasury Management Agency Introduction It is a pleasure to address the Annual Investee and Business Leaders’ Dinner organised by the National Treasury Management Agency  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I plan today to explore some of the factors determining the evolution of the real   interest rate over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This is obviously relevant to the NTMA in its role as manager of Ireland’s national debt and also to its other business areas   and related entities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">More generally, the real interest rate is at the core of many financial valuation models, while simultaneously acting as a fundamental macroeconomic adjustment mechanism by reconciling desired savings and desired investment patterns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">My primary focus today is on the real interest rate on sovereign bonds, which in turn is the baseline for pricing riskier bonds and equities through the addition of various risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The real return on government bonds in advanced economies has undergone pronounced shifts over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.67,0)">In contrast, the current low levels of the real interest rate take the form of low nominal yields, since inflation is itself low and stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Understanding the root causes of the low level of real interest rates is a high priority for monetary and fiscal policymakers, financial-sector participants and the wider populations of savers and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">, Kuvshinov, D., Schularick, M. and Taylor, A. M.  , “The Rate of Return on Everything, 1870-2015”, The Quarterly Journal of Economics,   1225-1298.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The euro area series is based on GDP-weighted data for Germany, France, Italy and Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.36,0)">Data for Italy before 1991, for Spain before 1980 and for Germany, France and the United States before 1973 are based on Jordà et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.06,0)">,   The natural rate of interest The falling trend in yields can be interpreted as a decline in the so-called natural or neutral rate of interest  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.69,0)">The natural rate of interest corresponds to the level of the real short-term interest rate that defines a neutral policy stance: this corresponds to a situation in which the economy is operating at potential and inflation is at its target value, such that there is no reason for the central bank to either inject or withdraw stimulus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.21,0)">In what follows I will explore the causes of this trend decline in r*.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Causes of the persistent low real yield environment I will structure my discussion of the drivers of r* around three broad driving forces: first, the determinants of potential growth rates; second, demographics; and third, diverging developments in the returns on risky and safe financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.8,0)">These three factors are embedded in the textbook economic growth model, which relates the equilibrium rate of interest to economic growth, population growth and the discount rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">I will primarily focus on common international trends, even if cross-country differences in these driving forces have important implications for return differentials and international capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">,   The potential growth rate One fundamental driver of r* is the potential growth rate of the economy: in a high-growth economy, it takes a higher real interest rate to encourage the volume of saving required for the high investment levels needed to sustain a fast-growing economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.43,0)">Although easier to see with the benefit of hindsight, there has been a sustained decline in the potential growth rate of advanced economies in recent decades: it is estimated to be less than half of what it was 50 years ago  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This pattern also carries over to expectations about future growth performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.61,0)">The decline in potential output growth in turn can be attributed to a decline in total factor productivity growth   and a corresponding decline in labour productivity growth  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The first observation for Consensus long-term growth expectations is 1999 for the euro area and 1990 for the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Latest observation: 2021 for euro area potential output growth estimates, 2019 for all other series.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.19,0)">A range of inter-related structural and technological factors have been advanced to explain the decline in the potential output growth rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Assessing the determinants of the rate of technological innovation is beyond the scope of this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In addition to the pace of frontier innovation, aggregate productivity growth also depends on the rate of technology diffusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.94,0)">There are signs that the diffusion rate has slowed: for instance, the gap between the labour productivity growth of firms operating at the technology frontier in a given sector and that of firms that are lagging behind the technology frontier in that sector   has increased over time  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.97,0)">This pattern is even more pronounced in the services sector than in manufacturing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">NACE Rev.2 1-digit services sectors are then aggregated with value-added shares.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.33,0)">Latest observation: 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.7,0)">This, of course, raises the question of why technological diffusion has slowed down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.7,0)">One candidate is the fall in business dynamism as measured by business churn: the rate at which firms exiting the market are replaced by new ones has declined measurably over the last decade  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Finally, shifts in the sectoral distribution of economic activity also play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.23,0)">Employment growth has been concentrated in the services sector in recent years, and productivity growth in services has been weaker than in other sectors, such as manufacturing and information technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.28,0)">As a result, the growing share of services in total employment mechanically implies a drag on productivity growth in the economy as a whole  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.18,0)">Assuming that the structural shifts I have just described account for a loss in potential output growth of around 1 percent, a back of the envelope calculation suggests that these account for a decline in real equilibrium yields of a similar magnitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.84,0)">Looking ahead, it is difficult to predict whether these structural trends will be reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In particular, there is a wide range of views about the potential economic impact of digitalisation, automation and artificial intelligence, which depends on the success rate in converting new technologies into economically-successful business applications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In turn, aggregate investment dynamics will be heavily influenced by this discovery process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Another open question relates to climate change and the carbon transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.36,0)">On the one side, future productivity growth may be further depressed as a consequence of climate change – either directly due to natural disasters or indirectly due to required climate change mitigation measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">On the other side, the carbon transition is also a spur for investment and opens up new opportunities for innovation and productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Demographics Let me now turn to a second driving force for the real interest rate: demography.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.35,0)">Over the last 50 years, demographics in advanced economies have been characterised by low fertility rates and rising life expectancy  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.81,0)">As a result, people now expect to enjoy many more years in retirement than they did in the 1970s, as   Over the same period, the annual growth rate of the working-age population has fallen from over 1 percent to zero and is projected to turn negative  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Projections begin in 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.36,0)">Latest observation: 2017 for historical data and 2050 for projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.68,0)">Latest observation: 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.98,0)">All other historical data and projections are from the OECD.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.38,0)">Latest observation: 2018 for historical data and 2050 for projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.98,0)">All other historical data and projections are from the OECD.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.38,0)">Latest observation: 2018 for historical data and 2050 for projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Projections begin in 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.36,0)">Latest observation: 2017 for historical data and 2050 for projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.76,0)">But how do these demographic trends – which are without precedent – affect the equilibrium interest rate?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A number of mechanisms are at play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.59,0)">First, the ageing of the population can depress the demand for capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This in turn is due to the fact that the ratio of installed capital relative to the size of the work force increases as the population ages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.99,0)">Second, ageing can lower productivity growth and thereby reduce investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.05,0)">This materialises if the productivity of older age cohorts is lower than that of younger age cohorts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Third, in relation to savings rates, if rising life expectancy implies longer retirement periods then individuals and those responsible for publicly provided pensions face incentives to save more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Taken together, a lower level of desired investment and a higher level of desired saving imply a reduction in the natural rate of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.78,0)">Some observers have conjectured that the negative impact of ageing on the equilibrium real rate will be reversed once the largest age cohorts retire and begin dissaving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.35,0)">However, the increase in the capital-labour ratio associated with a sustained phase of higher saving and a contraction in the workforce will weigh on the level of real interest rates for a considerable time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.78,0)">In terms of magnitude, a wide range of estimates suggest that the downward impact on equilibrium real rates from slowing population growth and rising life expectancy over the period from 1980 to 2050 amounts to about 1 to 2 percentage points in both the United States and the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">While demographics constitute a powerful inter-generational influence on aggregate savings, the intra-generational distribution of income also matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.44,0)">The central difference between personal factor income and pre-tax income is the treatment of pensions, which are counted on a contribution basis by factor income and on a distribution basis by pre-tax income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The population is comprised of individuals over age 20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.91,0)">The base unit is the tax unit defined by national fiscal administrations to measure personal income taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.58,0)">The first observation is 1970 for Japan and the United States, and 1980 for the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.0,0)">Latest observation: 2017 for European Union, 2014 for United States and 2010 for Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.37,0)">Diverging trends in the return on capital and on safe financial assets A further complication relates to shifts in the relation between the return on so-called safe assets   and wider measures of rates of return, including equity returns and returns on higher-risk debt instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.7,0)">In related fashion, there has also been a shift in the relation between the returns on short-term instruments and those on longer-term instruments, with term premia that are much smaller now than in earlier periods  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">On the one side, we have observed that corporate bond spreads have held up and estimates of the equity risk premium have increased, in both the United States and the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.8,0)">On the other, the demand for short-term money-like instruments has surged, and the yield on those instruments has dropped to unprecedented negative values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The premium on safe assets is due to several inter-related factors, with the relative importance of individual factors shifting over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">First, ageing may play a role in moving portfolio preferences towards lower-risk assets, with older savers seeking safer income streams as retirement approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Second, at a global level, the accumulation of reserve-currency low-risk assets has been a central strategy for many emerging economies, in seeking to limit financial fragilities associated with a lack of foreign-currency liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.87,0)">However, this force has plausibly weakened in recent years, due to the strengthening of domestic-currency financial systems in many emerging markets and the adoption of more flexible exchange-rate regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.41,0)">Third, the safety premium also reflects the lingering effects of the global financial crisis and the euro area sovereign debt crisis  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.15,0)">By revealing the harsh costs of exposure to financial disasters, such crises tend to shift portfolio preferences in the direction of assets that preserve their value during bad times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">In a similar vein, in recognition of the fact that the pre-crisis financial system was not sufficiently capitalised   and not sufficiently liquid, regulatory reforms have also fuelled demand for safe assets, since banks have a reduced risk appetite and are also required to hold more liquid assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.22,0)">In terms of the supply of safe assets, the surge in public debt in the wake of the crisis and the operation of the doom loop between the risk profiles of banking systems and sovereigns has led to a relative contraction in the share of highly-rated sovereign bonds in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.68,0)">The share of government bonds in the euro area with AAA-rating from at least two rating agencies collapsed by two thirds and has become more concentrated  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.23,0)">In the euro area the ratio of highly-rated short-term assets relative to GDP appears low in international comparison  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">More generally, safe asset scarcity tends to be most visible in yields on assets that provide the best hedge against liquidity, interest rate, or default risk  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.87,0)">,       Short-term debt refers to securities with a residual maturity of up to and including 2 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.32,0)">Latest observation: 15 October 2019 for government debt, end 2017 for GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.03,0)">Empirical Summary The decline in potential growth rates, demographic trends and the portfolio shift towards safe assets combine to put downward pressure on the equilibrium real rate of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.37,0)">This rate is not directly observable: at any given point in time, temporary factors push the economy away from its underlying steady state so that the measured real interest rate also reflects these shocks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.17,0)">However, analysis by the ESCB Working Group on Econometric Modelling indicates that, taking the impact of these driving factors into account, the equilibrium real interest rate in the euro area has been around zero or negative in recent years  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Similar estimates are reported in the growing literature on the global equilibrium real interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">While    , “Taylor-rule consistent estimates of the

demographics; risk preferences in portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Nonetheless, the implications of the level of real interest rates for the formulation of monetary policy are profound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In particular, monetary policy ultimately has to be calibrated vis-à-vis the underlying equilibrium rate of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">If, for example, inflation stabilisation calls for monetary stimulus due to a negative demand shock, the central bank is required to engineer an easing of financial conditions relative to the steady state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.38,0)">If the prevailing inflation rate falls short of the inflation aim and the equilibrium real rate is low – or even negative – this may call for a substantially negative policy rate in order to stabilise medium-term inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.31,0)">Furthermore, if the policy rate is already close to the effective lower bound, alternative methods of providing monetary stimulus may be required to substitute for deeper rate cuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.54,0)">For example, a 1 percentage point decline in steady-state inflation translates into an equivalent loss of capacity to cut the policy rate in the event of an adverse shock: this is a large magnitude, given standard calculations of the monetary easing required during downturns in order to stabilise inflation over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Options to ease monetary policy when the conventional policy space is constrained include forward guidance about the future path of policy rates; asset purchase programmes; and targeted lending operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Since the summer of 2014, the ECB has been active in employing all of these instruments and our assessment is that these unconventional policy measures have been highly effective in easing monetary and financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">At the same time, to avoid that the effective lower bound constrains monetary policy too frequently – and thus to reduce the need for unconventional policy tools – it is essential that inflation is centred at its target over the medium term, so that the limitations imposed by a low equilibrium real rate are not further compounded by an inflation trend that is also too low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.9,0)">In relation to other policy dimensions, a low equilibrium real rate reflects – as I discussed earlier – low expected potential growth rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">It follows that growth-enhancing structural policies and growth-optimising public investment rates would translate into an upward shift in the equilibrium real rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.44,0)">In addition, population ageing poses many policy challenges, and the policy choices that are made will have significant implications for trend savings and investment rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In addition, in the event of negative shocks, the speed of convergence back to steady state can be accelerated if macroeconomic stabilisation is supported by counter-cyclical fiscal policies   in addition to the stabilisation policies of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In addressing the safe-asset premium, policies that reduce negative tail risk are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Much has been done in the aftermath of the crisis to mitigate tail risks, especially in relation to the financial system: bank capitalisation levels have been increased, reinforced by an additional layer of loss-absorbing debt instruments; supervisory oversight has been enhanced, including through the creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism; macroprudential policy frameworks have been initiated; macro-financial imbalances are more contained; and the European Stability Mechanism is a source of stability in the sovereign debt market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Still, it is also clear that the current system for bearing risk remains far from optimal, with the completion of banking union and the deepening of capital markets union offering much potential for risk sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">In turn, a greater degree of risk sharing reduces the need for individual entities to self-insure through the accumulation of safe assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">On the supply side, the sustained through-the-cycle maintenance of fiscal discipline   will over time lead to an improvement in the risk assessments of the national sovereign debt of euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In addition, the supply of safe assets could be boosted at the euro area level through a range of innovations, even if some of these proposals require a significant deepening of fiscal union at the area-wide level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">I am grateful for the contribution by Claus Brand and Danielle Kedan to this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">For a discussion of the evolution of nominal interest rates, see Lane, P.
