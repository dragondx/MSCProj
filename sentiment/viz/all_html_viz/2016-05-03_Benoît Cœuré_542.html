    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)"> Government bond markets in a changing environment Keynote address by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Government Borrowers Forum, Paris, 3 May 2016 *** In a keynote address at the Government Borrowers Forum, in Paris, ECB Board member Benoît Coeuré analyses the impact of recent policy interventions on market functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">His remarks focus on unconventional monetary policy measures, regulatory developments and private-public partnership in financial market reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.21,0)">«Policy interventions are having an impact on market functioning today» he says, but in the case of the ECB’s monetary policy, «ongoing monitoring so far does not suggest impairments to the price discovery process» and «our monetary policy has not suppressed market discipline».</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The new market environment is more constrained, but also more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">«At the same time, more safety is not a substitute but a complement to well capitalised banks and sound public finances» he concludes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">*** Let me begin by saying thank you to the World Bank and the Agence France Trésor for inviting me to speak today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The speed of change during the financial crisis, and of the regulatory responses to it, has particular resonance for borrowers who think in long time scales, such as governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Six years have now passed since the famous Pittsburgh G20 communiqué, where many initiatives for the ongoing regulatory agenda to prevent similar crisis in the future were launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Some of those initiatives have already had a profound impact on global interest rate markets, such as those related to derivatives clearing and market transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.16,0)">Yet six years is also significantly shorter than the average new issuance maturity for the government borrower members present here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This implies that many bonds issued in 2010 will be rolled over in very different markets – from level, structural and regulatory perspective – from those that we knew at the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And that is not to mention the ultra-long bonds recently issued by several governments, including France’s latest 50 year issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">In some cases, for instance for trade reporting and transparency, the crisis simply provided the necessary catalyst for overdue improvements in market practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.06,0)">In others, related for instance to risk-taking by banks or the rigging of benchmark rates, the bad practices of the past had to be curbed by regulatory fiat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">A third group of changes, such as the rise of electronic trading, were happening already before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.91,0)">While it is straightforward to see the steady-state benefits of all these developments, the potential side effects and transition problems are more difficult to assess.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">As a result, a holistic assessment of their impacts on systemic stability and economic efficiency is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.15,0)">But that is beyond the scope of my remarks today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.19,0)">What I would like to focus on is one issue in particular, namely the impact of recent policy interventions on market functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Specifically, I would like to discuss three areas: the impact of unconventional monetary policy measures; the impact of regulatory developments; and the role of private–public partnerships in financial market reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The impact of unconventional monetary policies Starting with monetary policy, the key issue is as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Efficient price formation requires that large transactions can be rapidly executed at low cost with limited price impact – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">that markets are liquid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.29,0)">But are unconventional measures, such as negative interest rates and asset purchases, positively or negatively affecting market liquidity conditions and thereby that price formation mechanism?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.41,0)">It is of course difficult to disentangle the individual effects of each of the policy measures we have taken in the recent years, as they have all been introduced as part of wider policy packages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Still, there are some points that can be made about the tools in isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.59,0)">First, negative interest rates on our deposit facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Beyond some initial hesitation, the transition to negative rates has happened smoothly in both capital and money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">The technical challenges related to the implementation of negative rates, notably in terms of market infrastructures, have been well anticipated and addressed by market participants, and we now have proof that market functioning below zero does not imply different logics and mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.5,0)">Or as I said elsewhere, there is life below zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In particular, possible adverse effects of negative rates on general trading activities seem to have been limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.03,0)">While volumes in the euro money markets have been declining , they have been also impacted by the significant increase in excess liquidity as well as regulatory developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.68,0)">A case in point is the volumes traded in the Eonia market, which did fall substantially after the deposit facility rate was cut below zero in 2014, but are up 60% since the beginning of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.92,0)">In addition, negative rates have been accompanied by receding fragmentation in the unsecured overnight money market, at least for the higher-rated counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">For example, the spread between rates paid by banks with an investment grade credit rating in formerly stressed and non-stressed jurisdictions is close to its pre-Lehman level and significantly improved since mid-2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The secured money market and security lending market have also been fairly resilient, and repo markets in formerly stressed jurisdictions have seen noticeable increases in trading activity, thanks to an overall improving environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">These developments are all the more important for us at the ECB since we take great care to ensure that our exceptional policy measures do not have an irreversible impact on market structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.97,0)">More generally, we have not yet seen negative rates have a major impact on market makers themselves – in particular via the topical channel of banks and their profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">I can only repeat here what the ECB has already said on several occasions, namely that banks’ profitability has actually improved when you look at the overall impact of our monetary policy, thanks to a combination of lower funding costs, increased lending volumes and lower loan-loss provisions, which dominates by far the direct cost of negative rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.96,0)">To be sure, this would not necessarily remain true if the deposit facility rate were to be set at significantly lower levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.49,0)">But this is why I have said elsewhere that we would not take it to absurdly low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">If anything, the smooth changeover to negative rates has only underlined the adaptability of market participants to this new environment, especially the money market funds industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Turning to the longer end of the yield curve, can the same upbeat assessment by made about our asset purchase programme?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">As of 2 May, the ECB had purchased EUR 733 billion of securities under its Public Sector Purchase Programme  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.07,0)">Theoretically, such large-scale asset purchases by the central bank could have either a positive or a negative effect on market liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.44,0)">On the one hand, the willingness of the central bank to purchase assets reduces market risk for potential buyers – that is, the risk that they are unable to sell the assets later on when needed to obtain liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Such investors might therefore be ready to buy those assets at a somewhat higher price, which compresses the standard measure of market liquidity, the bid-ask spread.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.36,0)">This situation is more likely in cases where investors fear that markets might become disrupted and demand dries up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">On the other hand, with central bank purchases the risk that potential sellers might be unable to sell at a later point in time is also reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Those investors may therefore be ready to sell now only at a somewhat higher price, which makes the bid-ask spread wider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.41,0)">Moreover, if the central bank holdings of a particular security are sizeable relative to the total amount issued, that security becomes scarcer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.68,0)">This can translate into longer inventory holding problems and higher trading costs and this case investors will be more reluctant to hold those securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.42,0)">In other words, the impact of the PSPP on market liquidity remains an empirical question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.49,0)">And looking at the available data, we do not see evidence of significant disruptions in market functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">First, price discovery appears to be smooth and issuers are able to place new securities to the market in large volumes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.85,0)">Trading volumes have not fallen systematically as a result of PSPP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.84,0)">Based on TradeWeb data, trading volumes in core markets such as Germany are roughly 5% lower than two years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">However, trading volumes in Italian, Spanish and Portuguese bonds on that platform are around 20% higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.14,0)">That said one should not draw hasty conclusions from what remains a fragile set of indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.31,0)">Too little is known of the liquidity offered by dealers to end-investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">And therefore, the ECB will monitor market liquidity carefully as our asset purchase programme is further rolled out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Second, it is important to learn from Arthur Conan Doyle and note ‘the dogs that didn’t bark’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.97,0)">We have witnessed several shocks since we began our purchase programme that, in other conditions, might have led to substantial market volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">For example, the major realignments of global FX reserve portfolios in the summer of last year passed without a significant increase in euro area yields or yield volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In this sense, the presence of PSPP has aided market functioning by providing a constant source of demand in the market and by flexibly directing this demand towards particularly oversold securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.96,0)">At the same time, the spike in sovereign yields in Portugal earlier this year shows that our monetary policy has not suppressed market discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Finally, as general remark, one should always keep in mind that our combined measures are designed to prevent growth and inflation from being too low for too long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.43,0)">If we allowed such a situation to materialise, the impact on banks and investors would be much more severe than the impact our measures are said to have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The impact of regulation Alongside monetary policy, the new regulatory environment is a second key policy parameter affecting market functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.84,0)">The most prominent regulations cited by dealers as having had an impact on market liquidity are the leverage ratio, the liquidity coverage ratio  , the net stable funding ratio  , as well as structural bank reforms  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">While it is difficult to definitively identify a causal link – some observers note that banks and dealers are in the process of re-allocating business between risk-weighted asset and leverage ratio constrained lines of business – there are some reasons to suggest that market behaviour is consistent with the dealer behaviour mainly being constrained by the leverage ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.79,0)">The implied reduction of balance sheet available to trading desks, however, does not have a straightforward effect on liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.22,0)">Instead of a general widening of bid-offer spreads, which would be consistent with a general drop of liquidity, the reduction of available balance sheet has had two salient features in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.73,0)">First, liquidity has been rationed to a larger degree in the sense that dealers have had to deploy their balance sheet selectively towards the most profitable businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.42,0)">Second, liquidity itself has become more volatile and unevenly distributed across market segments, leading to greater market segmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.46,0)">In particular, it is now more difficult for dealers to use cross-market positions to bridge liquidity across the sub-segments of the euro area bond market, because it is more expensive to carry spread positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Importantly, the Eurosystem is helping to alleviate these collateral shortages by making all securities purchased under the PSPP available for securities lending, both by national central banks and by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.53,0)">But what is the longer term solution to the side-effects of regulation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the policy discussion, the focus is now turning from designing the next piece of regulation to assessing the compounded impact of what has been done and implemented so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In my view there is scope to fine-tune and streamline the regulatory landscape to iron out some of these unintended consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">But even if costs are identified, that would not justify rolling back the core tenets of what has been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">I can only agree with New York Fed President Bill Dudley that “even if higher capital and new liquidity requirements were found to result in greater transaction costs, these costs would need to be assessed against the benefits of having a more robust and resilient financial system and a reduced risk of financial crises in the future.”  Remember that in the run up to the financial crisis, there was an illusion that liquidity could be provided for free to issuers and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.35,0)">Such liquidity was a mirage  created by distorted risk assessments and hidden cross-subsidisation across capital market activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">So even if we now legislate to prevent the risks we know, we will not abolish the risks we don’t know.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">On the contrary, the more we eliminate the obvious risks, the higher the conditional probability of experiencing a crisis stemming from a non-obvious source.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">That is why upholding legislation to make the financial sector more resilient – in particular stronger bank capital – is such an important complement to stronger market regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Better regulated markets may mean that banks bear less risk, but it does not mean they should not be strongly capitalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The role of private-public partnership in financial market reform The new market environment, however, is not only being shaped by official regulation, but also by quasi self-regulation – that is reform initiatives adopted by market participants, with the public sector giving it the initial impetus and a strong steer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.91,0)">This brings me to the third part of my remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">While such changes are by definition less spectacular, what could appear as “soft developments’” can sometimes lead to considerable improvements in terms of market safety and reliability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Take the example of the reference rates, notably in interest rate or FX industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.79,0)">Over the last years, a number of scandals have illustrated that relying purely on market practices in order to calculate benchmarks was not necessarily optimal, and in some specific cases, detrimental to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">In reaction, the private sector has been active in improving the benchmark-setting process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Codes of conduct have been developed by the benchmark administrators to better control the rate-setting process and clarify the responsibilities of contributors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The governance of the benchmark administrator itself was also clarified so as to avoid interest conflicts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.51,0)">For some benchmarks, audits are regularly performed to verify the reliability of the contributions to a benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Additionally, private initiatives to rethink market needs and identify alternative benchmarks are taking place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">But the public sector has not been absent in the genesis of these market changes: since 2013 the FSB and the International Organisation of Securities Commissions   have worked on a reform process of benchmarks , accompanying and steering the efforts of private market participants to define more robust and reliable benchmarks and related “best practices”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">In addition, in the European Union the public sector has supported the process with legal texts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Indeed, the final draft of an EU Regulation on financial benchmarks was voted by the European Parliament on 28 April.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">A wide range of benchmarks will now be covered by the new regulation, improving the reliability of the benchmarks, complementing and supporting the “soft law” of market practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">On these topics, the ECB has been strongly committed to the improvement of the relevant benchmarks for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">While the ECB was always of the opinion that financial benchmarks should be private initiatives to best suit private needs, we have also helped the private sector in some of the benchmark reforms given the tremendous consequences of certain benchmarks for proper market functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In particular, we are closely accompanying the transition of the Euribor from a quote-based to a transaction-based index.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">We have been involved in the discussions for some time as, together with the Euribor administrator, we launched data collections in 2012 and 2013 to analyse the feasibility of a transaction-based reference rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Now the transition to the transaction-based methodology, with a pre-live phase starting this summer, is foreseen by the Euribor administrator for early 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.0,0)">The small size of the panel of contributors, however, remains a risk for the continuity of this reference rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">For that reason, the ECB expects banks as active users of Euribor to take responsibility for the benchmark and to stand behind its production as contributors with the launch of the new calculation methodology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">If the private sector fails to assume responsibility for the benchmark, given the major consequences at stake, the ECB would support the possibility of mandating the banks judged as relevant to contribute to the benchmark under the newly voted EU Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Regarding FX benchmarks, the ECB has also been active in the recommendations of the Foreign Exchange Benchmark Group of the FSB, along with other central banks and regulators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In particular, the ECB took the lead by reforming its own FX reference rates framework so as to discourage market participants’ trading activity related to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Given that ECB reference rates are provided as a public good for individual citizens and institutions, it is essential to safeguard a high level of integrity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Concluding remarks Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Policy interventions are undoubtedly having an impact on market functioning today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The key question, however, is what is the sign and magnitude of those impacts, and whether the trade-offs they present are worth it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.89,0)">In the case of the ECB’s monetary policy, our ongoing monitoring so far does not suggest impairments to the price discovery process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">But even more importantly, our measures are essential to restore a more robust economic environment where inflation is in line with our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">That environment is the most important variable for dealers and investors and therefore for market functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.81,0)">What is more, it is important to remember that not only policy interventions affect market liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.08,0)">For example, high frequency electronic trading has been blamed for various rapid market moves and charges have been brought against some uses of such technology .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.79,0)">Though innocuous in certain situations, such technology can also raise barriers to some investors’ access to liquidity, which would narrow the range of trading interests and could exacerbate volatility spikes when no market participant is there to “catch a falling knife”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">So to return to my initial question of how changes in market structure will affect the funding strategies of long-term borrowers, the best answer I can provide is that the interests of regulators, issuers and investors are aligned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">All want markets to be able to absorb debt without large dislocations and price formation to be orderly and transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This requires that we continue the direction set in Pittsburgh in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">From regulatory developments to best practices, market structures are progressively changing, evolving to a new market environment that is more constrained but also more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">At the same time, more safety is not a substitute but a complement to well-capitalised banks and sound public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">, “Life below zero: Learning about negative interest rates”, Presentation at the annual dinner of the ECB's Money
