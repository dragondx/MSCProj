    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.18,0)"> Four years of Banking Union: where do we stand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Opening Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Banking Supervision, Resolution and Risk Management conference during the 21st Euro Finance Week, Frankfurt am Main, 13 November 2018 It’s a pleasure to attend Euro Finance Week again this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This is a good opportunity to reflect on the state of the banking union and the Single Supervisory Mechanism, or SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.28,0)">Four years ago, at the start of this ambitious project, scepticism was rife.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.7,0)">Despite the general consensus that European supervision and a banking union were necessary complements to a monetary union, many questioned whether this was a realistic goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.3,0)">Without wanting to sound overconfident, I believe we have largely proved the sceptics wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Tough and fair European supervision, backed by tougher regulation, has contributed to making our banking sector significantly safer and sounder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">I will highlight just two of many relevant issues: In general, banks now hold more and better-quality capital than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The fully-loaded CET1 ratio of significant institutions was 13.8% in the second quarter of this year, up by 2.6 percentage points compared with the last quarter of 2014 .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">We have also made significant progress with something that each and every supervisor is concerned with: non-performing loans, or NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.34,0)">Banks are holding significantly lower levels of NPLs on their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.09,0)">For banks under direct ECB supervision, the gross NPL ratio fell from €958 billion when the SSM was launched to €688 billion in the first quarter of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">There is still some work to do here, and it should be done quickly while the sun is still shining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Of course, the SSM is not the only pillar of this banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.2,0)">Tougher supervision does not mean that there will never be another bank failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.38,0)">It is neither our task nor our objective to prevent each and every bank from exiting the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.64,0)">Banks can and should exit the market if they are managed in a risky and unsound manner, or if they are structurally incapable of maintaining their competitiveness based on a sound business model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But they should do so in an orderly fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">And thanks to the second pillar of the banking union, the Single Resolution Mechanism, we are now better equipped to ensure this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Having briefly looked back, let me now look to the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I would like to stress two points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.79,0)">First, while the banking sector is more resilient than it used to be, I am not fully satisfied with the current situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">And second, I would like us all to keep in mind that, while a resilient banking sector is a necessary condition for financial stability, it is not enough on its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">In other words, increased resilience does not mean we will never see another crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.3,0)">Supervisors must continue to be tough on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">And legislators should support them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.56,0)">As memories of the crisis fade, I see a high risk of complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.95,0)">Not only has there been a slowdown in the momentum for reform and further harmonisation of unjustified differences in national supervisory law, in some countries we have even started going backwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.24,0)">We should all remember that the lesson of the crisis was clear: light-touch regulation and supervision of the banking sector does not work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Any short-term gains will be more than offset by the damage to the economy caused by the resulting financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">So banks must continue to improve in several areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">And now is a good point to stress that financial stability is also good for the banks themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">For a start, many banks should take advantage of the good times to continue cleaning up their balance sheets and adapt their business models to face upcoming challenges – the current economic environment is as good as it gets!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">All banks also need to further strengthen their risk management frameworks, IT systems and internal capital and liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.86,0)">But not only banks still have work to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In this vein, I would like to mention several points that will be relevant to the discussion later on: There are still approximately 30 microprudential national options and discretions addressed to Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Many important European tools, such as fit and proper assessments and the early intervention measures, are covered by directives which have to be transposed into national law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.09,0)">This adds to the fragmentation and leads to an uneven playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.82,0)">We still lack harmonised supervision of third-country branches and investment firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.28,0)">For some important directives, such as the anti-money laundering one, transposition into national law has been held up or hasn’t even started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But as I promised to keep this statement short, I will stop here for now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to our discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Constant sample of significant institutions which reported the ratio in all periods</span>
