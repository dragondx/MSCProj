    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)"> Integration of the European Financial Sector Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBInternational Banking Event, 29 June 2004, Frankfurt am Main.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Introductory remarks Madam Lord Mayor, ladies and gentlemen, I am very glad to address this distinguished audience in the prestigious Römersaal, surrounded by this impressive series of German emperors’ portraits amongst whom, you will not be surprised, I would particularly distinguish the first one, Karl der Grosse, Charlemagne, who also has the biggest portrait.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">These paintings highlight very well the major role Frankfurt played in history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Besides its political influence, Frankfurt developed a key role in European banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">A young man called Rothschild started his business here before expanding all over Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Today, the large presence of major German, European and international banks and the dynamism of the Stock Exchange demonstrate well the great importance of Frankfurt as a city of banking and finance at the heart of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">I see therefore a great interest in addressing tonight the issue of European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Furthermore, now is also the appropriate timing to reflect on the best approach to further progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The Financial Services Action Plan reaches completion and the gaps that remained in the core legislative framework have been filled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Market participants should now grasp the opportunity to reap the full benefits of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">My talk today aims at providing some food for thought on financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I would like to stress four points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">First, giving an overview of what we should understand by financial integration, why it matters for the economy and for the ECB, and what key steps have been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Second, underlining the progressive setting of the framework for a single financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Third, providing an overview of the progress made so far in banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">And fourth, setting out the actions that may and should be undertaken to optimise the benefits from financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The context of financial integration What does it actually mean to have an integrated financial sector in Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">An integrated market is perhaps easiest understood when it concerns goods, and where it refers to a situation where there are no barriers to trade across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The same reasoning can also be applied to the wider context of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Market participants should generally not be discriminated in their access to the market on the basis of their location, and cross-border transactions should be treated equally to domestic ones, notably in terms of rules and costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Progressing towards such an ideal setting with regard to all the segments of the financial markets is the challenge before us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me give you some examples of what integration means in practice in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Near perfect integration has already been achieved in the unsecured interbank money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.57,0)">Almost immediately after the euro's introduction, the differences in rates across the euro area became so small that shifting funds across borders to exploit these differences became unprofitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.52,0)">We also observe that banks only very rarely resort at the same time to the Eurosystem's credit and deposit facilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">This shows that geographical borders are not an obstacle anymore to shift liquidity in the banking system quickly and efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Integration has also advanced in the repo-market, probably one of the most dynamic segments of the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Also the interest rate swap market, which is crucial for banks' interest rate risk management, has developed into one of the euro area's most liquid and integrated markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Market participants are now using this market to define their interest rate benchmark rather than the market of government securities, where some national differences are still relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The European corporate bond market is still young but has grown strongly with the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Integration seems to be reasonably well, as demonstrated by the growing competition for fees between banks that arrange and underwrite issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Finally, with regard to equity markets research conducted at the ECB shows that in the euro area local stock returns are more and more driven by common European news, rather than purely local events, which points to considerable integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Large insurance companies, pension funds and investment funds also take a more pan-European view in their portfolio decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Before such an audience I do not have to recall in detail that the benefits of financial integration are very numerous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">But similar to many public goods, one might not always be directly aware of the benefits although they are very substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Financial integration results in deeper and more liquid markets, more efficiency and a better allocation of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">It further facilitates the allocation of capital to the best investment opportunities, leads to lower prices for consumers and raises the economy's growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">A recent study, for example, quantified that the overall level of EU-wide real GDP may increase by more than 1% over a decade or so as a result of further integration, and that employment would also benefit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.72,0)">The cost of equity capital was estimated to fall across Europe by about 40 basis points, with a further reduction of 10 basis points arising from reduced clearance and settlement costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Apart from these more general benefits, there are also reasons why we at ECB in particular attach great importance to financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Evidently, the financial system plays an essential role in the transmission of monetary policy and integrated European financial markets facilitate the implementation all over the euro area of the ECB monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This holds especially for markets that are directly involved in our operations: the money market, but also the bond market since the vast majority of the assets we take as collateral are bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Another reason for our interest relates to our responsibility for the promotion of a smooth operation of payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Integration, particularly at the level of infrastructure, facilitates this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Lastly, integration also contributes to financial stability, another key issue of interest for central banks, since a larger and more diversified financial system is better able to absorb economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">A robust public policy framework as a precondition for integration Ladies and gentlemen, European and national authorities have worked hard to establish a sound public policy framework for the single financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">I believe that the main pillars of such framework are now in place for financial integration to progress even further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me address its core elements, namely regulation, supervision and financial infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.33,0)">Regulation First, the regulatory component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Here, I have to mention foremost the impressive achievement of the Financial Services Action Plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Set out in 1999, the Plan has led to the adoption of 39 Community measures - the result up to now - for the legislative framework of the single financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Of course, the impact of the FSAP on financial markets will take some time to manifest itself fully, but I am convinced that the expected benefits of a modernised regulatory framework are very substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I will illustrate this with the new EU rules for the capital adequacy of banks and the accounting reform that is now underway in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">A robust capital adequacy framework for banks is a key condition for a single financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Indeed, an efficient and stable European financial system requires that regulatory capital requirements are sufficiently aligned with banks' underlying risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The authorities in the different countries should also implement the rules consistently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.11,0)">The need to revise the requirements is the result of an important gap that exists between the present rules and banks' risk management practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.32,0)">The average bank of 1988, when the Basel Accord was adopted, is a very different animal compared with the average bank today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Globalisation, the shift towards market-based financing and the speed of financial innovation have all significantly changed banks' risk profile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The current Accord, which is based on a simple scheme of very broad risk categories, hence needed to be revised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Moreover, the current Accord applies in a uniform way to all types of credit institutions, from the smallest local savings banks to the largest global players, regardless of the quality of their risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The new framework, which I presented as Chairman of the G10 together with Jaime Caruana, Chairman of the Basel Committee, last Saturday in Basel, addresses these concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Basel II is based on three pillars, namely minimum capital requirements, a review process by supervisors and market discipline It also introduces more comprehensive and risk-sensitive rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For example, in addition to the already existing capital requirements for credit risk, banks will for the first time have to set aside capital for their operational risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Basel II also allows for different ways to calculate the minimum requirements and the institutions that opt for the most advanced methods get a capital advantage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">In this way, institutions have an incentive to further develop their risk management capabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">The ECB strongly supports the new framework and considers that its incorporation in the European rules will be another milestone for the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">But the consistent implementation of the new rules remains an important area to watch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Close co-operation between supervisors will be of utmost importance to achieve effective convergence, both within the EU and on a world-wide basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">I now turn to the current endeavours in developing an internationally harmonised accounting framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">This reform is especially important for the EU because of its contribution to financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I recall that from 1 January 2005 onwards, all listed companies in the EU will be required to publish their consolidated accounts in accordance with international accounting standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">A first step in this direction was the adoption of a Regulation endorsing all International Accounting Standards, with the exception of two controversial standards concerning the recognition, measurement and disclosure of financial instruments, IAS 32 and 39.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">These standards are particularly important for the banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.02,0)">It is therefore no surprise that they have triggered an extensive debate among the industry, supervisors and standard-setters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">The ECB has a keen interest in these new rules because of their impact on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">We therefore carried out work in this area, mainly from a financial stability angle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.59,0)">Our concerns relate in particular to the reliability of calculated fair values, the comparability across institutions, and the impact of changes in a bank's own credit risk on its capital position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">We conveyed our concerns to the IASB, which triggered additional discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We will follow with extreme attention the developments to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Supervision Supervision is the second pillar I see of a framework for integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The timely finalisation of the FSAP is a very impressive achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Its full benefits will now be reaped if the rules are implemented and enforced consistently among Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In this process I see a crucial role for the Lamfalussy approach to financial regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">This new framework provides for the establishment of sectoral committees of national authorities to pursue a consistent implementation of European rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The new arrangement will be very valuable for the FSAP, but also for the EU regulatory provisions in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The Lamfalussy approach addresses the supervisory challenges arising in more integrated financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.57,0)">Banking groups that perform a lot of their business in other Member States rightfully expect to face similar attitudes and procedures of national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">This is crucial for alleviating their compliance costs and also to ensure that no major competitive distortions are introduced through widely diverging supervisory practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">It is also a precondition for further cross-border activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Regulatory convergence, which applies to high-level principles, has therefore to be complemented by supervisory convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In other words, in the day-to-day practice the high-level principles have to be consistently implemented by supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">National authorities must therefore step up their information exchange and identify best work practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Moreover, closer co-ordination of supervisory actions is needed, especially for the major EU financial groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The Lamfalussy approach will not only foster financial integration, but also help to preserve financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In integrated financial markets, risks can more easily spread from one institution to another and from one country to another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The so-called 'systemic risk' is therefore no longer confined to one Member State but has to be looked at from an EU-wide perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The role of the Committee of European Banking Supervisors to enhance the cross-border exchange on individual institutions is therefore certainly important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">At the same time, the CEBS's work is complemented by that of the ESCB's Banking Supervision Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The BSC closely monitors developments in the European financial system from a macro-prudential perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">It has also been working successfully on arrangements of co-operation in the area of financial crisis management, another important dimension of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Financial infrastructure I now come to the third important element of a robust framework for financial integration and that is often unknown to the general public, namely clearing and settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This particular infrastructure lies at the core of all financial markets and is indispensable for their proper functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Integration here means that the place where securities are issued do not affect investors’ clearing and settlement costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.56,0)">It also means that the conditions at which banks obtain central bank money is not affected by the location of the securities they use as collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Purely domestic retail payments as well as clearing and settlement activities in the EU are relatively cost effective and safe, but there is still progress to be made as regards cross-border arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.6,0)">We at the ECB have a particular interest in the clearing and settlement infrastructure because of its role in the implementation of monetary policy Moreover, a major malfunctioning in this area might have important implications for the financial system at large and threaten financial stability The ECB is active in this field in various ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">First, through the development of TARGET Integration in payment systems and the euro money markets was achieved very quickly after the introduction of the euro because of the existence of TARGET, the large-value payment system operated by the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This will soon be replaced by TARGET 2, which will reinforce the benefits from a common infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">It will also provide for a harmonised level of services and a single price structure TARGET 2 is a clear illustration of how public authorities can contribute to financial integration by providing a common technical infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The second way the ECB is active in this area is through the removal of the remaining obstacles to integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.36,0)">The report prepared by the Group headed by Alberto Giovannini identified three types of barriers to efficient and competitive markets: differences in technical requirements and market practice; tax differences; and issues relating to legal certainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">For its part, the ECB contributes to removing these obstacles mainly by acting as a catalyst for improvement and by encouraging discussion among the relevant players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">We also try to harmonise our central bank procedures and operations, which is beneficial to integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Finally, we also contribute to an integrated regulatory and oversight framework for clearing and settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We set risk management standards for the securities settlement systems that are used for our credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We also regularly assess the systems that hold collateral for our operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In a broader perspective, given the potential effects of the failure of a major clearing and settlement system, we think that public standards for risk management are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The ESCB, in co-operation with the Committee of European Securities Regulators, is currently developing such standards for EU clearing and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Assessment of the progress that has been made in cross-border banking I remain very much convinced that the framework to foster financial integration in Europe is now largely in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">My perception is supported by the many indications that we have seen over the past years that integration has advanced rapidly and has now reached a very significant level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I already gave you a number of illustrations in the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I will like now to say a few words on the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me start with the structure that European banking groups use for their cross-border business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The Banking Supervision Committee has done some background work on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It appears that a major European banking group is on average present in five to six of the, former 15, EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Often, such groups have spread out to neighbouring countries through branches and subsidiaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">As we all know, regional financial groups have for example developed in the Benelux and Scandinavian countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.92,0)">But groups that are present in almost every EU Member State are still a very rare phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.95,0)">I do not interpret these results as some kind of indication that integration would have failed in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In that respect, I find it very instructive to look at what happened in the US over the past decade or so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">In the mid nineties, the restrictions on interstate banking were significantly loosened in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">But banks did not rush to set up branches all over the country; on the contrary, they preferred to expand in neighbouring states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.65,0)">US banks that choose to operate on a national basis also continue to be rare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.98,0)">Then we should not necessarily interpret the absence of truly pan-European banking groups as an indication of low integration, bearing in mind the US example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Another relevant point we have to look at is the mode through which banks prefer to enter other EU markets; they can provide their services directly across borders, or prefer to set-up a local branch or a subsidiary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In that respect it is important to bear in mind that the single passport applies to the direct provision of services and branches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But contrary to what one would perhaps expect, banks prefer to offer their services across the EU mainly through subsidiaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.83,0)">Again, this is sometimes interpreted as a lack of integration, but I think the answer is more complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">It continues to be a fact that having a local establishment in a country is still an important factor to gain local business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">A Spanish family or family-owned business will probably continue to have a preference for a local Spanish bank that has a clear local identity and that is aware of the needs of the local community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">And this can be more easily achieved through a local subsidiary rather than a branch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">We therefore see that at least until now the preferred way of banks to gain a foothold in another EU Member State is through mergers and acquisitions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Over time, domestic banking consolidation has been consistently higher than cross-border consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">If one looks at deals with a significant value, then the total value of domestic transactions in the EU sum up to around EUR 280 billion for the period 1999-2003 compared to EUR 50 billion for cross-border deals in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">However, domestic consolidation might be a prelude to cross-border consolidation as banks seek to reinforce their domestic position before expanding abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In addition, the relative importance of cross-border deals has increased over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">For example for every EUR 100 of domestic consolidation in the five years preceding the euro, there were cross-border deals of EUR 6; in the five years after the euro's introduction the figure had tripled to EUR 18.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">As a result of cross-border M&As, and to a lesser extent also the expansion of branches, the share of banks from other EU Member States is in some national banking systems already very significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This is foremost the case in the new Member States, where such shares often range between 70 and 90%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I have concentrated here on the restructuring and reshaping of the pan-European commercial banking sector, particularly the retail banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">As regards investment banking the situation is already pretty different, with a relatively small number of pan-European institutions and a number of non European institutions being very active.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Challenges for the future Ladies and gentlemen, let us turn now to the challenges ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The first challenge ahead is that the single financial market should be equipped with a consistent regulatory process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is echoed by the financial industry in the current debate on the post-FSAP strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In particular, the private sector advises that further integration also depends on the extent to which regulation and supervision converge among national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In this respect, I consider that the Lamfalussy process will allow for more flexible and uniform technical rules across Member States and lead to convergence in national supervisory practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It will therefore be paramount to exploit the process to the maximum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">I would urge all national banking supervisory authorities in the context of the newly established Committee of European Banking Supervisors to deliver concrete results in a reasonable period of time in the area of convergence of supervisory tools and practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This should include supervisory reporting in order for the industry not to see any difference all over Europe when submitting data to supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Second, the financial industry has the decisive role to play in the development of the single financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.35,0)">Laws and regulations alone cannot extend the boundaries of marketplaces or define new products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">On the contrary, market forces should ultimately drive the integration progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Collective action by market participants, perhaps with the support of public authorities, has therefore to be organised at the EU level to overcome possible co-ordination problems in this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.32,0)">The integration of money markets is a clear example of how actions by market players themselves may underpin integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The EONIA, the reference rate for overnight unsecured interbank deposits, was developed by market participants with the facilitating role of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This example also illustrates how public authorities may also play the role of catalysts of collective action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">And third, European financial integration is a process which calls for a very attentive monitoring as regards its impact in terms of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">A large number of complex processes are at stake : better allocation of capital resources all over a vast continental economy of 450 million inhabitants ; better assessment of risks through enhanced quality of management of financial institutions ; enhanced market discipline ; concentration of investments in a fewer
