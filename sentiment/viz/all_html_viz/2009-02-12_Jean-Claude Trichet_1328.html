    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)"> Ten years of the euro: successes and challenges Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBOsnabrück, 12 February 2009 Introduction Dear President Pöttering, Dear Dr. Hentschel, Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for inviting me to Osnabrück.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Today I’m going to speak to you in German.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">That is for me both a pleasure and a challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">I’m pleased to have come here, for the Osnabrück region is the home of Hans-Gert Pöttering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">I have got to know, and have come to hold in high esteem, Hans-Gert Pöttering as President of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As the President of the European Central Bank, I am a regular guest at the Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">For us at the ECB, relations with the directly elected representatives of the people of Europe are very important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Osnabrück is also a suitable place for a speech on European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Its epithet is the “city of peace”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">It was here and in Münster that the Peace of Westphalia was negotiated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It was the basis for peace in Europe in 1648 after the Thirty Years’ War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Today it is European integration that forms the basis for prosperity and peace in Europe during the last 60 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Main part The euro is the most visible symbol of European unification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Economic and Monetary Union is the field in which integration has progressed the most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The euro is the currency now shared by 329 million people in 16 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Ten years ago – on 1 January 1999 – it was introduced in the then 11 countries of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.85,0)">Ten years is a short time in history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">But it represents a good opportunity to talk about successes and challenges – the subject of my address tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I wish to consider this theme by asking three questions: How successful is the euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.41,0)">What is the euro’s role in the current financial market turbulence?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">What challenges lie ahead for the single currency?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I intend to refer to a series of current issues relating to the global financial market turbulence and economic developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The first question: How successful is the euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">The euro is a stable currency and is an important contribution to the completion of the Europe’s single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">That’s why it is a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">After all, it helps to secure prosperity in the participating states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Stability of the euro Let me first of all consider the theme of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Before the euro was set up there were reservations about the stability of the future single currency, including in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The first ten years have shown that these fears were unfounded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The euro is just as stable as its most stable predecessors, which were merged into it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">That applies of course also to the Deutsche Mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">“The euro will be as strong as the Mark”, it was said.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">That promise has been kept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.03,0)">A glance at the inflation rates in the euro’s first decade makes this clear: the average annual inflation rate in the euro area in the ten years since the introduction of the currency was 2.2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.27,0)">By comparison, the average annual rate of inflation in Germany in the 1990s, before the euro was introduced, was also 2.2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.41,0)">In the 1980s, the rate was 2.9%, in the 1970s 4.9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In other words, in terms of stability, the euro does not need to shy away from any comparison with the Deutsche Mark and other legacy currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">At 2.2% per year since 1999 average inflation was somewhat above the level that the ECB’s Governing Council has defined as price stability: an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2% in the euro area, over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Nevertheless, the result remains good, for the first ten years were anything but calm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.42,0)">In particular, we had an oil price shock, which was certainly comparable with that of the 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Between early 2002 and mid-2008, crude oil prices in dollar terms rose by nearly 600%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.27,0)">In the case of food prices as well, we faced price pressures: at the beginning of the decade, and in particular in 2007 and 2008 by the global rise in food prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.32,0)">Despite these shocks and short-lived erratic price movements, inflation rates remained generally low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Above all, inflation expectations were and are firmly anchored at a level in line with our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">In other words, economic agents and financial market participants expect the ECB to ensure price stability over the medium and long term whatever the amplitude of the short-term impact of the various shocks it has to cope with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">They trust our commitment to stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">This is expressed most clearly by the issue of euro-denominated bonds with a maturity of 30 and even 50 years, the yields of which stand at a remarkably moderate level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">For example, a 50-year French government bond maturing in 2055 currently yields 4.1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">This implies confidence into the stability of the euro – in its function as a store of value – extending beyond more than one generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.89,0)">Cash changeover and price increases I know that in Germany and in other countries in the euro area the introduction of euro cash in 2002 was “associated” with price increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.07,0)">Was the euro “a Teuro”?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">There were some price increases in the course of the cash conversion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">The statistics office of the European Union – Eurostat – estimates that the cash conversion added between 0.12% and 0.29% to the inflation rate in the euro area in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.12,0)">This was overall small in 2002 and negligible over the ten years of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.15,0)">Also to be noted is the discrepancy between the “felt” inflation and the actual, statistically measured inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.52,0)">This discrepancy cannot be attributed to a measuring error in the consumer price statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">These statistics are of high quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.51,0)">There are some reasons for the deviation between “felt” and measured inflation after the cash conversion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">For example, price increases occurred particularly in the case of frequently bought goods and services usually paid for in cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.35,0)">Such prices are more strongly “felt” than prices for products which are only bought from time to time, for example, cars or computers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.23,0)">It is also possible that consumers are still comparing current euro prices with prices in the national currencies before 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.97,0)">This “frozen price memory” leads to distorted comparisons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">It also needs to be taken into account that the introduction of euro cash in January 2002 coincided with increases – caused by external factors – in energy and food prices and in indirect taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.46,0)">They were not at all related to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.78,0)">In the public perception, however, they were associated with the cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.39,0)">Institutional foundations of the euro Many observers did not think the ECB could ensure price stability and anchor inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Indeed, the ECB is a young central bank which, together with the national central banks in the Eurosystem, has assumed responsibility for a new currency, the euro, in a new economic and currency area, the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Therefore it could not be taken for granted that the euro would be able to establish itself so quickly as a stable and internationally recognised currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">This was only possible because the ECB and the national central banks of the Eurosystem have solid institutional foundations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">These foundations are the treaty negotiated in Maastricht in 1991 and the Statute of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB are clear: the primary objective of the Eurosystem is to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The ECB and the national central banks of the Eurosystem are independent so that they can pursue this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.64,0)">Neither the ECB, nor the national central banks, nor the members of their decision-making bodies may seek or receive any instructions from anybody.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This applies to European as well as national institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">They, for their part, are obliged to respect the principle of central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The priority given to price stability and the independence of the central bank are the results of a long, historical learning process in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">It is theoretically well founded and empirically proven that independent central banks are better able to ensure low inflation rates than those which are subject to political influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Independence guarantees above all that central banks can focus on securing price stability over the medium and long term and are not exposed to short-term political influences, or to vested interests’ pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In Germany the primary mandate of price stability and the independence of the central bank, as embodied by the Deutsche Bundesbank, have a long tradition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This tradition and the Statute of the Bundesbank – which also inspired other central banks’ statutes in Europe - were one of the major forces behind the Treaty of Maastricht and the Statute of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I have myself been the governor of the independent Banque de France during these ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The independence was granted in January 1994, five years before the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">During these five years I was particularly proud that our primary goal, price stability, was reached in line with our definition – below 2% - and was fully compatible with price stability in Germany during the same five-year period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">It can be said that, with the creation of the euro, the stability culture has been “Europeanised” and given the legal face of an international treaty European stability consensus The primary mandate of price stability and the independence of central banks as laid down in the Maastricht Treaty, are an expression of a stability consensus which has grown in Europe – even worldwide – in recent decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">There exists today a general awareness of the fact that stable prices are indeed a fundamental condition for sustainable economic growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">The priority for price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy as well as the independence of the ECB enjoy broad support from the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">In surveys of citizens throughout the euro area, an overwhelming majority regard price stability as an important goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">An overwhelming majority believe it important that the ECB and the Eurosystem are independent of governments in order to achieve this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">This support from our fellow citizens in the Euro area matters greatly to the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">It shows that the stability consensus is overwhelmingly shared among the public to which, as an independent institution, we are ultimately accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The euro as a contribution to the completion of the single European market The guarantee of price stability for the now 329 million Europeans in the euro area is the main reason why the euro has been a success story in its first ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.95,0)">But it is not the only reason.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Let me briefly mention another important reason: the introduction of the euro was an important contribution to the completion of the single European market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">The advantages of the single market could be better exploited by the common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Trade and capital ties between euro countries have grown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">I’d like to mention a few examples: The cross-border trade in goods and services in the euro area has increased by about 10 percentage points in relation to GDP since the introduction of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This can be partly attributed to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Trade between individual euro countries now accounts for about half of their total exports and imports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">At the same time, extra euro area trade developed very dynamically as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Increasing trade integration within the monetary union did not come at the expense of trade with third countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Hence, there is no “fortress Europe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The euro has promoted competition, price transparency and the convergence of prices, and has lowered transaction costs and eliminated exchange rate risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The euro has boosted direct investment within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Mergers between companies in the euro area have risen noticeably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The euro has also led to a marked increase in cross-border security investments within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This is only one example of the contribution made by the single currency to the integration of the financial markets in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.57,0)">It’s not over yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The ECB and the Eurosystem strongly support a further integration of Europe’s financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">These developments show that the euro is an important catalyst for the completion of the single European market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The logic of “one market, one currency” was a substantial impetus for monetary integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">It has proved to be correct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The euro, monetary policy and employment Priority for price stability, which is a necessary precondition for sustainable growth and employment, in the euro area did not come by any means at the expense of employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">This is reflected in a number again: between the introduction of the euro in 1999 and 2008, the number of persons employed in the euro area increased by more than 16 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.99,0)">In the years before, from 1990 to 1998, the increase in persons employed was less than 6 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">These new jobs in the euro area were not created by the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.97,0)">There is no direct relationship because the change in employment is affected by many factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">But it is a confirmation that a monetary policy oriented towards price stability is fully compatible with job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.12,0)">I would like to come now to my second question: What is the role of the euro amid the current financial market turbulence?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.36,0)">The question makes clear that the global environment in which we operate has completely changed in the past 18 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.1,0)">Global financial market turbulence and the economic downturn We are currently in an extraordinary situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.44,0)">It is marked by an intensification and broadening of the global financial market turbulence – in particular since September last year – and a sharp downturn in the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.61,0)">The tensions have increasingly spilled over from the financial sector to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.85,0)">Their negative effects can be felt worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Since the end of 2008 virtually all economies – both of the industrialised countries and the emerging markets – have been moving in the same direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This considerably contributes to the scale of the present downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.39,0)">This economic downturn has also affected the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.74,0)">Foreign demand for exports from the euro area has fallen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.06,0)">Very low confidence and tight financing conditions have adversely affected domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.04,0)">On the basis of our current analysis, we see persistent weakness in economic activity in the euro area over the coming quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.08,0)">The financial market tensions have a further impact on the global and domestic economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.6,0)">The economic prospects are still marked by an exceptionally high degree of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Reaction of the ECB and European governments The ECB reacted quickly and flexibly to the financial market turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">On 9 August 2007 we were the first central bank worldwide to recognise the tensions on the money market and to take important steps in the context of our liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">With a very flexible liquidity management we ensured that solvent banks did not get into difficulties because of liquidity constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.81,0)">This has been the case in particular since September 2008 after intensification of the financial turmoil, which led to a very sharp rise in tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">When reacting to the financial market turmoil, the ECB has always differentiated between liquidity management on the money market and its monetary policy stance ensuring price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.16,0)">We lowered the key interest rates when there was increasing evidence of inflationary pressures diminishing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.68,0)">The decline in the inflation rates is due mainly to falling commodity prices and a significant slowdown in economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.65,0)">Against this background, the Governing Council of the ECB lowered the key interest rates by 2.25% between October 2008 and January 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is an unprecedented reduction in such a short period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In this way we have taken account of the easing inflationary pressures in the light of the economic downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The governments in Europe have also reacted rapidly, resolutely and in a coordinated way to the financial market upheaval: they have prevented banks from collapsing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">And they extended a line of defence against a possible systemic solvency risk, especially through credit guarantees and recapitalisation measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">This prevented a systemic crisis and created a basis for fresh confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">These efforts of the central banks and of the governments are aiming at permitting the banks to live up to their role in the economy by resuming lending to economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.12,0)">Reasons for a medium-term economic recovery 2009 will be a very difficult year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.73,0)">I have already said this on various occasions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">I see however at least four reasons why we can be confident that the world economy and the industrialised nations will recover: The vigorous reactions of central banks and governments to the extraordinary situation – not only in Europe, but worldwide – will progressively produce their effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.31,0)">They may not yet have been sufficiently taken into account in the expectations of private sector participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The growth potential of the emerging market economies, for example, in Asia, is considerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.49,0)">Their current deceleration of growth is temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Many of these countries have an enormous potential to develop domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Technological progress is very rapid and will continue and even accelerate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">It is a major source of future long term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.01,0)">Prices for oil and other commodities have fallen sharply since mid-2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.68,0)">Their rise was an important factor in the current economic weakness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Their present low levels will be an expansionary contribution to the global economy For these reasons it seems to be a reasonable working hypothesis that after an exceptionally difficult 2009 we will see an economic recovery in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Lessons of the financial market turmoil An economic recovery must not however be a reason for returning to ‘business as usual’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Lessons must be learnt from the financial market turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This work is still under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Many national, European and international institutions and bodies are discussing the conclusions to be drawn for the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">The global financial system must become more resilient in order to avoid such episodes in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I would like to name three key words, which point to the need for change: short-termism in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.68,0)">A far too short time horizon for many actors in the financial system has contributed, among other things, to an excessive risk appetite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">That’s why, for instance, the compensation systems and risk management of the banks need to be profoundly improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The transparency of the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Full information on all institutions, instruments and markets of relevance to financial stability is of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.72,0)">The pro-cyclicality of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.35,0)">In the financial system there is a tendency to accept excessive risks in good times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.54,0)">In a downturn, sharp movements occur in the opposite direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.09,0)">Here, among other things, banks face the question of adequate capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Current developments and the euro’s role Against the background of the current developments, let me say a few words about the role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The last few months have shown us an important advantage of the euro: in stormy seas it’s better to be on a large ship than in a small boat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.02,0)">In history – also in the economic history – it’s always a speculation to ask “What if…?”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I want to do it nevertheless, because there are very well-founded hypotheses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.62,0)">One such hypothesis is: in addition to the financial market turmoil, the banking sector problems and an economic downturn, there would most likely be severe currency upheavals in Europe without the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.08,0)">We would likely face strong, erratic fluctuations between Europe’s national currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.46,0)">I call to mind in this context the crisis in the European Monetary System in 1992 and 1993.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.67,0)">It was triggered, among other things, by a difficult European and international environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.81,0)">We saw sharp tensions between individual national currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.05,0)">This led to abrupt shifts in competitiveness between individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.57,0)">The European Union’s internal market and in particular the free movement of capital were subject to tension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.69,0)">Without the euro we would be facing similar difficulties today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The central banks would be in demand as crisis managers on an additional front.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.47,0)">The euro does offer protection from distortions in the currency field which would worsen the current situation already marked by the financial markets’ turbulences and the global economic downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The commitment to the single currency of its founding fathers was visionary and trailblazing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">With the benefit of hindsight, we can see the introduction of the euro ten years ago as a prescient, forward-looking response by Europe to the challenges and risks of the present world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I would now like to consider my third question: What challenges lie ahead for the single currency?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.97,0)">Despite all the achievements, this is not the time for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.76,0)">There are important challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The most important and most direct is of course to tackle the financial market turbulence and the economic downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">But there are also challenges which go beyond tackling the current situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.14,0)">But they are related to it in part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">I would like to consider three challenges briefly: the securing of sound government finances, structural reforms in the euro countries and the expansion of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Securing of sound government finances Sound government finances are critical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">They complement the ECB’s stability-oriented monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.55,0)">They prevent the fiscal policies of one country in the euro area from having negative effects on other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Beyond that, sound finances make a national economy more flexible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">They are part of a growth-friendly environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">The fiscal policies of the Member States should promote the smooth functioning of Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The Stability and Growth Pact is the instrument to guarantee this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The Pact is the most important pillar in the economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It supports the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The strict and credible implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Against the background of the current economic developments, it offers the necessary flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.91,0)">Shortfalls in tax revenues and additional expenditure arising automatically from the economic situation support the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Where there is room for manoeuvre, additional fiscal policy measures can be effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">They should be timely, targeted and temporary, and take account of the respective country-specific situation with regard to state finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Notwithstanding all budgetary measures for supporting the economy in the short term, we need to ensure the sustainability of fiscal policy in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.74,0)">Public confidence in the soundness of state finances must not be undermined as this would also impair the effectiveness of the economic policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Therefore, “exit strategies” from the current fiscal stimuli should be already thought of.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Structural reforms Structural reforms in the countries of the euro area are very important for two reasons in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">They are necessary in order to enhance the flexibility and resilience of the euro area economy and to increase its growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Such structural reforms relate to the markets for goods and services, and the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Reforms of the goods and service markets should strengthen competition and accelerate an effective restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">An example of successful reform is the telecommunications sector, where liberalisation has enhanced competition, increased the variety of products and lowered prices, to the benefit of consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Labour market reforms should have two goals: to promote appropriate wage-setting and to facilitate labour mobility – the mobility between sectors of the economy and between regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Flexible job markets are important particularly in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.65,0)">Exchange rate adjustments are not possible in response to economic developments and changes in competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Therefore, wage policy in the individual countries bears a special responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.67,0)">It largely determines labour costs and thus a country’s competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It must take into account productivity, the employment situation and the competitiveness of the respective country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The relative cost competitiveness of the various economies in the euro area has to be monitored very closely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The present situation should be a catalyst, pushing further forward structural reforms in the euro countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The EU’s Lisbon strategy – which aims to make Europe’s economy more dynamic and competitive – and the completion of the internal market, for example in the services sector, are very important items on the European agenda which should not be forgotten in the present circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Enlargement of the euro area Many of the challenges confronting the ECB are shared with other central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve System, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">These include overcoming the financial market disruption and the economic downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Over the longer term, there is globalisation, with the rise of emerging market economies such as China and India, the rapid advances in science and technology and the ageing of our population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.88,0)">All these phenomena affect the economic environment in which central banks conduct monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.22,0)">The enlargement of the currency area for which we bear responsibility is a challenge specific to the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">No other central bank operates in an economic and monetary area whose expansion forms part of a structured integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">No other central bank regularly integrates new institutions, as the Eurosystem does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">With each addition to the euro area, the Eurosystem incorporates a national central bank in the “monetary team”, which consists of the ECB – the “captain” – and all the national central banks of the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The euro was introduced ten years ago into 11 EU Member States as a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.21,0)">At that time, the euro area had 292 million inhabitants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Today it comprises 16 countries with a total of 329 million inhabitants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Over the past ten years, five new members have joined: Greece, Slovenia, Malta, Cyprus and, on 1 January of this year, Slovakia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Slovenia and Slovakia were the first former communist countries from central Europe to join.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Their entry bears witness to their transformation over the past two decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The accession of five countries in ten years also reflects the openness of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.28,0)">We are not a “closed shop”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The euro area is open to all Member States of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">To join, a Member State has to fulfil the Maastricht convergence criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.41,0)">These relate to inflation, long-term interest rates, exchange rates and state finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The sustainable fulfilment of the convergence criteria before introducing the euro is in the interest of the countries concerned and of the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Countries should not introduce the euro without having first achieved the necessary economic convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">A high degree of sustainable economic convergence is required, so that they can be integrated smoothly into the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The convergence criteria are thus an important part of the stability-oriented set of rules of Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The ECB and the European Commission report regularly on the extent to which EU Member States outside the euro area are meeting the criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">They serve to maintain the credibility and functioning of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, When we look back over the first ten years of the euro, then we can do this with satisfaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.64,0)">The sceptical forecasts before its birth have not materialised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The euro is a historic achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Its first ten years have been a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">This is also seen, noticeably so, from outside our continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Europe can be very proud of what it has achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.44,0)">The euro has brought many benefits but as I already said, this is no the time for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.98,0)">We have many challenges to cope with in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Some are shared with the other important central banks in the world, like responding to the present economic and financial global situation and drawing all the lessons from the present turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Other challenges are specific to the Eurosystem, like the completion of the single market with a single currency and a successful enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The people of Germany as well as all 329 million fellow citizens in the euro area, can count on the ECB and on the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">You can count on us to continue providing a solid and reliable anchor of stability and confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Particularly in the current environment both these elements are essential.</span>
