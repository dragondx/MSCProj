    <h3> Speaker: Peter Praet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)"> Recent monetary policy measures supporting the euro area recovery Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the IIF Annual Membership Meeting, Washington D.C., 10 October 2014 Ladies and Gentlemen  , It’s a great pleasure to speak to you at this year’s IIF Annual Membership Meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Today, I will discuss the latest monetary policy measures by the ECB and explain how they will contribute to supporting the euro area recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">I would also like to expound how our measures, as they work their way through to the economy, will contribute to bringing inflation in the euro area back to levels closer to 2%, which is where we want to see it over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.12,0)">The last twelve months were eventful: we have cut our key policy rates all the way down to the lower bound – including by taking the deposit facility rate into negative territory; we have launched an important programme of targeted lending operations, the TLTROs; and we have announced two distinct purchase programmes, one of which targets asset-backed securities whilst the other targets covered bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In my remarks today, I want to focus in particular on these asset purchase programmes and explain a novel element to our communication that came with their announcement – that is, our emphasis on the impact of these measures on the ECB’s balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But first I will briefly review the economic situation in the euro area to provide you with some context for our decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Macroeconomic Context Following a flat reading for real GDP in the second quarter, the euro area economy is likely to resume its recovery path in the third quarter, but only at a modest pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.81,0)">In fact, the latest data point to a loss in the cyclical growth momentum, with the outlook surrounded by elevated uncertainty and downside risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.8,0)">Geopolitical tensions remain severe and the growth drivers appear rather anaemic, with macroeconomic adjustments, high unemployment and sluggish investment behaviour acting as a drag on economic dynamism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.95,0)">Inflation developments continue to surprise on the downside and recent weakness in wage growth casts doubt on the expected strengthening of domestic price pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.84,0)">Inflation in the euro area has declined from a high of more than 3% at the end of 2011 to a low of 0.3% in September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">And the volatility we have seen recently in medium- to longer-term inflation expectations is a cause for extra vigilance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In short, the latest data on the euro area economy point to a continued but increasingly fragile recovery and the uncertainties and downside risks surrounding the recovery have intensified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.97,0)">All the while, we are facing continuously sluggish money and credit dynamics – even if growth rates of some key aggregates have edged up in recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Consistent with this subdued picture, the latest ECB staff projections foresee growth and inflation to pick up only gradually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.06,0)">And, by the end of the projection horizon, annual HICP inflation is still expected to fall short of our target of a rate of inflation of below, but close to, 2% over the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">It was against this backdrop of a persistently weak inflation outlook, a slowing growth momentum, and subdued monetary and credit dynamics that we decided on a package of measures between June and October to provide further monetary policy accommodation and support lending to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Impact of June-October Policy Decisions The policy announcements since June, together with the rate cuts, have already led to a further considerable easing of the effective monetary policy stance – although the liquidity injections via the TLTROs and purchase programmes will only gain pace in the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">This additional easing is evident from various metrics of the market-based cost of financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.29,0)">Since the beginning of June, forward money market rates have shown steep declines across the maturity spectrum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.8,0)">Now, the forward curve consistently lies below zero over a two-year horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">EONIA is not expected to exceed 25bps before well into 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.83,0)">The 3-month EURIBOR rate, which is an important conduit of monetary policy impulses to lending rates, dropped to all-time lows and now stands close to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.22,0)">And the policy decisions, in particular those announced in September, triggered a compression of spreads across other asset classes, including ABS, covered bonds and sovereign bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.34,0)">The recent sharp compression of ABS spreads since June is particularly important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">To the extent this compression of secondary market spreads is passed-through, this would support loan origination and promote credit flows at lower lending rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">As indicated, this market response has materialised although the lion’s share of the liquidity injection of the measures is yet to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In September, we conducted only the first out of eight TLTROs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Notably in December, counterparties will have another opportunity to participate in the TLTROs drawing on their initial allowance of 7% of their outstanding stock of loans to the non-financial private sector, excluding loans to households for house purchase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">As of next year, there will be additional quarterly allotments, in which counterparties will be able to receive additional funding determined by their recent lending performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Moreover, starting in the fourth quarter this year, the liquidity injections through the TLTROs will be accompanied and reinforced by the ABS and covered bond purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The covered bond purchases will already start this month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Taken together, we expect that the combination of our measures – the TLTRO as well as the ABS and covered bond purchase programme – to have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet, as stressed in the Governing Council’s communication since September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This communication on the Eurosystem balance sheet has attracted attention among ECB observers and I would like to take a few minutes to explain its underlying rationale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Two dimensions of uncertainty Let me start by recalling the broader monetary policy environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.75,0)">The distinctive feature of the current situation is that monetary policy interest rates have reached their lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Hence, the ECB – like other major central banks before us – must rely on unconventional monetary policy initiatives to provide additional accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Inherent in these unconventional measures is that they work through channels that are still under-studied compared to the well-known channels of conventional monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.81,0)">This, in turn, gives rise to various dimensions of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.15,0)">One dimension of uncertainty relates to the final macroeconomic impact per unit of liquidity injected via the measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.64,0)">Of course, it is always and everywhere difficult to estimate that impact – even for standard policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.39,0)">But the connection between the market price that the central bank can influence through its interventions and the price of credit that matters for the macro-economy is generally thought to be more remote and tenuous than under conventional policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We manage this uncertainty by tailoring our measures to those specific financial market segments that we assess to be at the source of impaired monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But still, some uncertainty remains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.97,0)">The second dimension of uncertainty relates to the overall scale of liquidity injected via the latest policy initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.55,0)">This source of uncertainty is in some way more pronounced for the Eurosystem than for other central banks whose policy measures operate primarily through outright interventions in deep and liquid markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">One key building block of our recent policy initiative, namely the TLTROs, takes the form of credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This choice follows the long-standing monetary policy tradition in the euro area, which in view of our financial structure is centred on lending to counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">But, inevitably, this makes the overall scale of the measures to a large extent dependent on banks’ autonomous decision to participate and borrow, which is itself influenced by banks’ appraisal of the strength of the recovery and the prospects for a sustained rebound in credit demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.25,0)">In conditions in which these expectations may be re-appraised, the force of the overall monetary policy stimulus that can be expected to be introduced through the TLTRO is bound to become more uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.86,0)">The purchase programmes do not run into this problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But the capital market segments they target are not as deep and liquid as their equivalents in other leading economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.75,0)">This is particularly the case for the ABS market, which has yet to recover from a protracted period of minimal issuance activity and disappearing trading traffic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">ECB intervention will, in itself, partly mitigate this problem by encouraging issuance activity as well as the unfreezing of ABS and covered bonds that are currently retained on intermediaries’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.18,0)">However, these dynamic effects are difficult to estimate precisely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.61,0)">Taken together, these factors mean that not only the efficiency of the measures per euro of liquidity injection, but also the overall scale of the measures is difficult to anticipate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Balance Sheet Communication These considerations interact with our recent communication as follows: the clarification that the measures will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet is a way to manage the second dimension of uncertainty, the scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">It underpins our commitment to ensure a powerful transmission of the measures adopted in June and September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">And it gives reassurance that the liquidity injections will be scaled appropriately to ensure the intended macroeconomic impact, namely to bring inflation rates closer to 2%, materialises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">This reassurance provides market participants with a broad orientation on our future policy conduct that will help them navigate the uncertainties inherent in the current policy environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">This is all the more important since the TLTROs and the two purchase programmes are likely to gain pace only gradually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">All in all, it should thus be clear that the balance sheet communication does not establish an additional target for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Instead, in assessing the ECB’s monetary policy measures, the primary metric of success remains their impact on inflation rather than on the balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">So how will these measures contribute to stimulating higher inflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The purchases of simple and transparent ABS will strengthen the direct pass-through effect of the TLTROs, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">the extent to which the funding cost relief for banks will be passed along to their borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.89,0)">This is because the ABS market remains severely impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">As a consequence, the potential for interventions to change dynamics in this particular market is high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.35,0)">And the link between the spreads at which ABS are traded and the lending rates which banks apply on the underlying credits is probably tight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">CBPP3 will further complement the TLTROs and the ABS purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Covered bonds share important features with ABS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The link on the issuing bank’s balance sheet between the covered bond on the one side, and the underlying loans on the other is also reasonably tight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">As the prices for covered bonds are bid up, banks are likely to respond to the market incentives by originating more saleable covered securities, and thus more loans to collateralise them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Furthermore, outright interventions in this market will complement ABS purchases by reinforcing the portfolio rebalancing channels of transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">That is: the expansion in liquidity that will result from the combined outright operations promotes a diversification of investment patterns in the investor community, and thereby an easing of financing conditions more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Together with the monetary accommodation already in place, the determined implementation of our new measures will underpin the firm anchoring of medium- to longer-term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">We expect that the policy measures adopted in June and September will provide relevant support to the euro area recovery and bring inflation in the medium -term back to levels consistent with where we want to see it within our price stability range.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Should it become necessary to further address risks of too prolonged a period of low inflation, the Governing Council is unanimous in its commitment to using additional unconventional instruments within its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As the ECB President said at the European Parliament, and again yesterday in Washington, this means that we are ready to alter the size and/or the composition of our unconventional interventions, and therefore of our balance sheet, as required.</span>
