    <h3> Speaker: Fabio Panetta </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)"> The two sides of the  coin Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at Il Salone dei Pagamenti 2020 Frankfurt am Main, 4 November 2020 The payments industry is undergoing a digital transformation, and this transformation is accelerating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We can now pay with cards that are stored in our mobile wallets, ready for a transaction to be initiated at the touch of a button.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Mobile payment apps allow us to easily pay or send money to friends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">New services based on application programming interfaces, such as payment initiation services, are expanding consumers’ choice of e-commerce payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Fintechs have sparked the latest wave of innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In a recent survey by the European System of Central Banks, over 200 new payment solutions were reported, of which more than one-third were provided by start-ups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">New providers have progressively shifted their business models from fee-based to data-driven, where payment services are provided free of charge in exchange for personal data that offer deep insights into users’ preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">The global technology firms – the so-called big techs – are using this model to leverage their large customer base and expand in global markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Thanks to their global footprint, they are uniquely positioned to offer services in the area of global cross-border transactions, where current solutions are low quality and expensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This is the backdrop against which stablecoins have emerged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">They could be used by the big techs to offer innovative payment solutions that work both within and across national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">While stablecoin initiatives are still in their infancy, they should be carefully analysed as they could radically transform the payments landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Today, I will discuss the potential advantages and risks of stablecoins, and their implications for the payments market, the financial sector and the overall economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">I will then turn to the forward-looking policies that are needed to steer innovation towards welfare-enhancing outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Two sides of the same  coin Stablecoins are digital units of value designed to minimise fluctuations in their price against a reference currency or basket of currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To this end, some stablecoin initiatives pledge to hold a reserve of State-issued currencies or other assets against which stablecoin holdings can be redeemed or exchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.34,0)">Stablecoins became the subject of heated debate last year, after the technology giant Facebook and its partners announced their own global stablecoin, Libra.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Global stablecoins are initiatives which aim to achieve a global footprint , without necessarily relying on existing payment schemes and clearing and settlement arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">For example, Libra is an integrated construct that simultaneously encompasses a new settlement asset, a new payment rail and new end-user solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Global stablecoins could drive further innovation in payments, responding to the need for cross-border payments and remittances that are more efficient and cheaper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Indeed, the Financial Stability Board has proposed a roadmap to enhance cross-border payments that recognises a role for sound global stablecoin arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The flip side of stablecoins is the host of risks they can pose to our social and economic life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.35,0)">For example, data-driven models could pose a risk of misuse of personal information for commercial or other purposes, which could jeopardise privacy and competition and harm vulnerable groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.67,0)">Another concern is that wide acceptance of stablecoins offered by foreign companies would make European payments dependent on technologies designed and governed elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.9,0)">This could raise potential issues of traceability in the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.48,0)">It could also make the European payment system unfit to support our Single Market and single currency and vulnerable to external disruption, such as cyberattacks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.61,0)">Risks to financial stability and monetary sovereignty Other risks involve the monetary and financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.27,0)">In fact stablecoins, if widely adopted, could threaten financial stability and monetary sovereignty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">As I mentioned earlier, stablecoin issuers often promise that their stablecoins can be converted into fiat currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But this promise generally differs significantly from the convertibility mechanism for bank deposits or e-money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the case of bank deposits, one-to-one convertibility to the fiat currency is safeguarded by deposit insurance schemes and prudential regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The value and safety of e-money holdings are protected by the fact that e-money issuers must hold customer funds in custody by third parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.12,0)">These safeguards may not apply to stablecoins, which are therefore vulnerable to runs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.55,0)">If the issuer does not guarantee a fixed value, the price of the stablecoin will vary with the value of the reserve assets, and a run could occur whenever users – who bear all the risks – expect a decrease in the redemption price of the stablecoin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.18,0)">But a run could also occur if issuers do guarantee a fixed value of the stablecoin, if they are perceived as being incapable of absorbing losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.46,0)">Moreover, the need to cover redemptions could force the stablecoin issuer to liquidate assets, generating contagion effects throughout the entire financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.92,0)">In the case of a global stablecoin, this would affect multiple markets at once.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.19,0)">The payment network of a systemic stablecoin arrangement could also be a source of instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Stablecoin arrangements are payment systems, insofar as they permit the transfer of value between stablecoin holders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Moreover, stablecoin arrangements can qualify as a payment scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.41,0)">Just like any other payment system or scheme, if liquidity, settlement, operational and cyber risks are not properly managed, they may threaten the functioning of stablecoin arrangements and lead to systemic instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.65,0)">Large investments in safe assets by stablecoin issuers could have implications for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.25,0)">By affecting the availability of safe assets, these issuers could influence the level and volatility of real interest rates, with potentially undesirable consequences for financial conditions from a monetary policy perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.25,0)">Market functioning could also be negatively affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.38,0)">Furthermore, to the extent that stablecoins are used as a store of value, a large shift of bank deposits to stablecoins may influence banks’ operations and the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.74,0)">Extreme scenarios are probably not around the corner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.07,0)">Under current conditions, the reserve assets of the stablecoin issuers would be remunerated negatively , so non-interest-bearing stablecoins would hardly be viable unless they were subsidised by the issuer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.07,0)">We must nonetheless remain alert to possible developments that may affect how a central bank exercises its core mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Risks would seemingly be mitigated by allowing stablecoin issuers to deposit funds in accounts at the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">This would eliminate custody and investment risks for stablecoins and underpin their issuers’ commitment to redemption at par value into fiat currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.59,0)">But other fundamental problems would then emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.0,0)">In fact, the perceived safety of a private settlement asset – the stablecoin – would come at the risk of relegating other settlement assets, especially public assets, to a minor role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">A large take-up of stablecoins could replace sovereign money – a public good offered for centuries by the State to its citizens – with a “club good”, whereby payment services are offered to a select group of people in exchange for platform membership and personal data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.6,0)">This would not be acceptable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The function of sovereign money reflects citizens’ need for safety and their trust in the State.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Central banks offer sovereign money to all citizens, and manage it in the public interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Citizens should not have to choose between the convenience of their favourite apps and devices and safety, of which central bank money remains the highest expression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And we should safeguard the sovereignty of public money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Market structure, competitiveness and technological autonomy Stablecoins would profit from the comparative advantages that characterise big tech business models and their control of large platforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">They could therefore amplify the risks inherent to big tech’s expansion in the payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">The advantages of big tech firms are largely based on the control of crucial infrastructure for commerce and economic activity across Europe – from online marketplaces to social media and mobile technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.07,0)">If access to this infrastructure by third-party payment solutions were unduly restricted to benefit a stablecoin issuer, competition and consumer choice might be harmed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.36,0)">Furthermore, big techs may discourage investment by firms that are prone either to sweeping competition or acquisition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.08,0)">As I mentioned earlier, there is also a risk of global stablecoin issuers being handed the keys to vast amounts of personal data sitting on big tech platforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Besides raising data privacy concerns , this could become a powerful vehicle to transmit market power from one market to another, especially in the provision of financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.57,0)">Ultimately, entrusting foreign providers with the control of large pools of personal data could entail significant costs for both EU citizens and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.87,0)">The issues at stake range from data security and compliance with EU data protection law to cutting off the lifeblood of European financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">From analysis to policy European authorities need to respond to the ongoing transformation of the European payments landscape and to the potential expansion of large foreign players by promoting a competitive and innovative market and completing the regulatory and oversight framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">In order to contribute to reaching these objectives, the Eurosystem is implementing a comprehensive policy based on complementary elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The first element is the Eurosystem retail payments strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">It pursues objectives such as promoting pan-European initiatives that allow consumers and merchants to have easy access to efficient payments,  rapidly deploying instant payments, and harmonising electronic identity and electronic signature services and their use in payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The second fundamental element is the possible introduction of a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A digital euro would be a digital equivalent of banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It would provide citizens with costless access to a simple, risk-free and trusted digital form of central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">It would both shape and promote the digitalisation of payments, in turn supporting the modernisation of the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The Eurosystem is assessing the economic, financial and technological challenges a digital euro would raise, as well as its societal and strategic implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Earlier this month, we published our Report on a digital euro and started a public consultation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">We will assess the feedback we receive, so that if and when developments around us make it necessary, we will be ready to issue a digital euro that meets the needs of European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">A digital euro would complement cash, not replace it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">While its role is diminishing, cash remains the main way people make retail payments in the euro area, and we will ensure that it remains widely available and accepted as a reliable payment instrument and store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">These policies are being complemented with appropriate regulation capable of addressing the risks posed by new players while enabling innovation in financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">The ECB is introducing an innovative payment oversight framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">We have just launched a public consultation on a new framework for electronic payment instruments, schemes and arrangements  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">This new framework reviews some of our oversight tools and responds to the various technological and market changes by redefining the scope of our oversight activity and providing a future-proof, harmonised and proportional framework inspired by the principle of “same business, same risks, same rules”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">In parallel, the European Commission has published a proposal for a Regulation on Markets in Crypto-assets   , which sets Europe on a steady path to tackle emerging challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The legislative journey has just begun and will provide further opportunities for fine-tuning the proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The ECB is analysing it with a view to providing a formal legal opinion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Implementing these oversight and regulatory initiatives will guarantee that the prospective use of stablecoins to provide payment services within the EU will respect the same standards that currently exist for payment systems and instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">A multi-sectoral response from central banks, financial regulators, data protection authorities and competition authorities is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">The European Commission, in its Retail Payments Strategy for the EU, announced that it will examine the need for legislation in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.44,0)">Introducing systemic products based on stablecoins before the necessary elements of a comprehensive policy have been implemented, especially as regards the oversight and regulatory response, could endanger rather than benefit the European financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In September, five EU Member States   issued a joint statement which maintained that no global stablecoin  project should begin operation until the relevant legal, regulatory and oversight requirements have been addressed and met by the project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">And in October, the G7 Statement on Digital Payments  recognised the regulatory and public policy issues arising from global stablecoins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Conclusion The process of digitalisation cannot be reversed – on the contrary, it is picking up speed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Global stablecoins are an expression of the need for change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.22,0)">However, they can pose serious risks, both to our monetary sovereignty and financial stability and to the EU’s market structure, competitiveness and technological independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">We should continue to be open to global competition in order to foster innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">But we should first ensure that we are prepared to make the most of it, to the benefit, not the detriment, of EU citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The ECB’s response to the ongoing transformation of the payment system is first and foremost a policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Our focus is on stimulating the development of safe and efficient EU payments that are fit for global competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">For a detailed analysis of these solutions, see ECB  , “Implications of digitalisation in retail payments for the Eurosystem’s catalyst role”,
