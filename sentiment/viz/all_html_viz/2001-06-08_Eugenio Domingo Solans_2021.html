    <h3> Speaker: Eugenio Domingo Solans </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)"> Financial markets in the European Monetary Union Prof. Eugenio Domingo Solans, Member of the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.36,0)">Speech delivered at the 28th Annual Financial Markets Seminar, Valencia, 8 June 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In the years prior to the introduction of the euro, there was a consensus among politicians, academics, market practitioners and central bankers that the adoption of a single currency for Europe would only be successful if a number of prerequisites were met.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The most important of these prerequisites were spelled out in the Maastricht criteria, which you all have in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">A second set of prerequisites was implicit from the European policies initiated in the mid-80s, with a view to completing a single market for goods and services by 1992.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The existence of the single market, which encompasses financial services, is indeed an important requirement to ensure that all the benefits of the single currency can be reaped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Yet, when we have introduced the euro in 1999, the internal market for capital and financial services was far from being completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.08,0)">Today, two and a half years after the introduction of the euro, it is still not fully completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.1,0)">Often I hear the criticism that there remain elements of fragmentation between the national segments of the euro area financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And I accept that there are some elements of truth in this criticism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Yet, it is undeniable that there has occurred since 1999 a considerable acceleration in the process of integration of the euro area financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This process has not been driven only by public policies, but also - in fact mainly - by market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">What I conclude from this observation is the following: the integration of the financial markets of the euro area is a dynamic process, in which the single currency itself has acted and continues to act as a catalyst.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The relationship of causality does not go only from the existence of a single market to the appropriateness of sharing a single currency, but also the other way round.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In other terms, two and a half years into the life of the euro, we have probably seen only a small part of the beneficial consequences of the introduction of the single currency on our financial market and on our economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">These benefits will continue to materialise gradually over the years to come, until the single market is finally completed, and the benefits of the single currency can be reaped in their entirety.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">What I would like to discuss with you today is some evidence of the magnitude of the movement set in motion, as well as some of the questions this integration process raises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">If you allow me, I shall organise my remarks in four parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Firstly, I would like to recall the interest of the Eurosystem, as the central bank of the euro area, in the existence of a well-integrated financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Secondly, I will discuss briefly the desirable level of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Thirdly, I will underline the benefits of increased competition brought about by the introduction of the euro, and finally I will discuss the limits of competition as well as the involvement of public policy makers in pushing these limits further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The interest of the Eurosystem in a high degree of integration of the financial market The interest of the Eurosystem in a high degree of integration of the financial market stems, first and foremost, from the requirement that monetary policy be implemented in an efficient and homogeneous manner across the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Indeed, the financial markets are an essential element of the transmission process of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The money market is even a vital element of this process, since it is the market in which monetary policy is implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Clearly, the singleness of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem depends on the efficiency and the high degree of integration of the money market, but also of other segments of the financial market, across the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In fact, I would submit that this requirement was particularly crucial for the Eurosystem at the time of the introduction of the euro, precisely because of the initial conditions we were facing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.42,0)">It is not unusual to have a certain degree of fragmentation of financial markets in the jurisdiction of the central bank, and it is certainly quite common that different sectors of the economy react differently to monetary policy impulses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">This segmentation might however have been somewhat stronger than usual in the case of the euro area, at the time of the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Potential heterogeneity further down the transmission chain of monetary policy made it particularly crucial that the first steps of this chain be as homogeneous as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This applied in particular to the money market for unsecured deposits which, as you know, was fully integrated within days of the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I will elaborate further in the fourth part of my intervention on the particular circumstances that have allowed this success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But let me come back to the interest taken by the Eurosystem in the integration process of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Beyond the implementation of monetary policy, a second source of interest is related to the other tasks assigned to us by the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Among these is the promotion of a smooth functioning of payment systems and contribution to a smooth conduct of national policies in the field of prudential supervision and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">In this context, an efficient and well-integrated financial market is seen as an important element of robustness of the whole financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.81,0)">To take but one out of many possible examples, difficulties in the cross-border transfer of securities, especially where they are used as collateral against the supply of credit, may exert tensions on the smooth functioning of the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">A well-integrated securities market infrastructure, where assets can be transferred easily and safely across borders, contributes to alleviating these tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">There is however a third element that underpins our deep interest in the development of a mature, well-functioning financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is linked, not to our direct tasks, but more generally to our role as a public policy-making body in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">The Treaty requires from us that, without prejudice to the objective of price stability of course, we support the general economic policies of the Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">In fact, the Treaty further indicates that the purpose of this provision is to contribute to achieving the objectives of the Community, the first of which is to promote economic and social progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">I believe that it is clear that such economic and social progress can best be ensured by an optimal use of the resources available in the European economy, and in particular capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">This alone is a sufficient argument for us to take a keen interest in a high degree of integration of our financial market, which allows capital to be steered towards the best investment opportunities, independently of the countries in which these opportunities arise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">To illustrate this general interest, I will, if you allow me, recall the strategic goal for the European Union decided by the EU Council in Lisbon last year and re-affirmed in Stockholm a few weeks ago: "to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth with more and better jobs and greater social cohesion".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">It is quite undeniable that this ambitious goal will not be reached unless the European Union in general, and the euro area in particular, develops financial markets able to channel efficiently the funds required to finance research and development, innovation, and generally support an entrepreneurial environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I would insist here on the superlative used by the EU Council, which does not refer to a competitive and dynamic economy, but to the most competitive and dynamic economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This, in my view, translates into the requirement that financial markets are not only efficient, but the most efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">While by no means out of our reach, this is clearly a formidable challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">What is the desirable level of integration?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Against such a demanding benchmark, I will now turn towards some of the current developments in euro area financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But first, I believe that it is not superfluous to qualify what I mean by integration, a word that I have used many times already.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.32,0)">Indeed, I often hear, for instance, that the European financial markets are not well integrated because there is not a single government yield curve, for instance, or a single stock exchange, or a single security settlement system for the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This normative interpretation, from my point of view, does not refer to the integration of the market, but to its full unification, which is a different concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.11,0)">While integration refers to the making up of a whole by adding together separate parts or elements, unification relates to the more demanding concept of reduction to unity or to a uniform system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.52,0)">In other terms, while integration recognises diversity, unification attempts at suppressing it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In the context of the creation and the development of the pan-euro area financial market, the relevant concept is quite clearly, as I indicated above, that of a market in which capital can be allocated to the most rewarding investment opportunities, independently of the locations of the lender and the borrower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The desirable level of integration is, accordingly, one at which all distortions that may hamper an efficient allocation of resources within the euro area are removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This underlying objective provides the yardstick to assess when unification is necessary, and when it would be counter-productive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The approach of that matter should not be normative, but rather positive, and very pragmatic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">In principle, diversity is welcome, especially where it introduces an element of efficiency and robustness in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">For instance, it is important that leading markets remain contestable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">While this favours innovation and hinders the emergence of monopolies or oligopolies, it does not prevent rationalisation nor economies of scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">There are, however, areas where full unification is desirable to ensure that competition can effectively be free and fair.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.36,0)">This applies mainly to elements of the financial market environment rather than to its participants, the most obvious example being that of the single currency itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The euro, in essence, is a monetary unification aiming at ensuring free and fair competition across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">At another level, the full harmonisation of market conventions, for instance as regards the calculations of coupons, is another example of unification facilitating the comparison between various financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">This is also conducive to a more efficient and competitive market for capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The benefits of increased competition This last remark leads me directly to the third part of my address, which relates, precisely, to the benefits of increased competition in the euro area financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Indeed, of all the factors of segmentation of the national financial markets of the European Union before 1999, the existence of different currencies probably represented the most powerful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Accordingly, at the time of the introduction of the euro, widespread expectations developed that the European Monetary Union would unleash previously refrained competition forces, which would lead to both qualitative and quantitative improvements in the functioning of euro area financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Evidence gathered to date shows indeed that the effects of competition forces have been considerable, and sometimes even exceeded expectations, or occurred in sectors where it was maybe not so widely expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.75,0)">Let me mention but a few illustrations of this remark: Competition between private market participants A first form of competition, where the effects of the euro are noticeable, is that of competition between private market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is probably one of the areas which has been the more often commented, and one in which most of you are directly involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.52,0)">I will therefore limit myself to providing a few examples of the two major consequences of this form of competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The first relates to the reduction of costs for the consumer, such as, for instance, the fees levied on stock exchange transactions or bid-ask spreads for transactions in major debt securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The second consequence is the trend towards rationalisation and consolidation in almost all sectors of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.93,0)">For instance, the number of monetary policy counterparties in the euro area has fallen, since the introduction of the euro, from almost 8,000 to just under 7,500.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">In the field of infrastructure, the merger between   and   to form a new central security depository under the name of IBERCLEAR is one of many examples of consolidation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">The trend towards consolidation has also materialised in the area of trading platforms, although here the phenomenon is much less clear as a variety of platforms have also seen the light of day over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This encompasses both inter-dealer platforms, such as the various elements of the MTS group or dealer-to-customer platforms, such as TradeWeb or Bondlick for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">In this same field, one example of consolidation has of course been provided, here in Spain, by the creation of SENAF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The development of electronic trading systems serves to underline the remark I made earlier: it is important that markets remain contestable, so that innovation can lead to efficiency gains, where they are possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">At this stage I should add that the introduction of the euro has not been the only source of reinforced competition in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The trend towards a more globalised economy, and the development of new technologies that, to a certain extent, challenge the concept of national borders, also contribute strongly to a more competitive environment, not only in Europe, but world-wide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Competition between public issuers Another field, where competition has developed strongly as a direct consequence of the introduction of the euro is that of competition between sovereign issuers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Indeed, where sovereign issuers benefited from what was essentially a monopsony position in their national market, they now compete with each other for a broader pool of savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.66,0)">With all due caution, one might argue that sovereign issuers now have to compete for funds in a way similar to private borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The consequences of the new form of competition between sovereign issuers have also been widely commented, and I will limit myself to recalling a few facts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">In the late 80s and early 90s, a few European countries, such as France and Spain, had undergone a reform of their government bond market, with a view, among other goals, to enhancing the liquidity of this core market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">With the advent of the competitive environment brought about by the introduction of the euro, those governments that had not previously done so have engaged in a similar restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Clearly a form of emulating process has developed, where all sovereign issuers are attempting to bring their own government debt market in line with the best standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Incidentally, the improvements brought to the government bond market extend also to other features, such as in particular the tax treatment of the coupons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">All in all, perhaps because this is one of the sectors where the increase in competition has been the most obviously marked, the sector of sovereign issuance is one where this new competition has delivered some of the most spectacular benefits to investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.81,0)">Competition between legal and regulatory environments But let me now turn to two forms of competition less widely commented upon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.71,0)">The first one refers to competition between legal and regulatory environments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Free circulation of capital across Europe, and beyond, was a reality well before the introduction of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">However, it seems that it is only after the introduction of the euro that pressure has mounted on legislators and regulators alike to provide their national financial centre with a truly competitive legal and regulatory environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">To illustrate the content of my remark, let me take a very practical example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Prior to the introduction of the euro, the main - albeit not the only - mortgage bond market in Europe was the German Pfandbrief market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The German legal framework allowed for the issuance of asset-backed securities by German banks in conditions that were not available to many banks in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">The effect of competition has been felt here too in the sense that other European countries, such as France for instance, have been encouraged to pass legislation aiming at providing their own domestic institutions with a similar legal framework for issuance of asset-backed securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">What I find very telling in this example is that in almost every case, the new legislation was designed with the German Pfandbrief legislation as a benchmark, and with a view to provide an environment that could compete with it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The clearer evidence to that effect is the wording of the press release issued by the Irish government on February 26th of this year, announcing the approval of a draft legislation - I quote - "which will provide for the introduction of new financial instruments in the Irish market - mortgage and public credit bonds similar in nature to the German Pfandbrief".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Finally, and I quote once again, the Irish government draws attention to the fact that "the introduction of the euro and the new monetary policy framework has led to the development of an integrated and competitive money market in the euro area".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I believe that this illustration provides evidence of the new form of competition that I was hinting to, a competition between legislators and regulators themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">I believe also that the wording of the communiqué of the Irish government points to the potential benefits of such a form of competition, if it effectively leads to a convergence across the euro area of the national legal and regulatory environments towards the "best practice" and the highest standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.65,0)">Of course, such a form of competition can only be expected to develop at a relatively slow pace, if only because of the time needed to assess the need for new legislation, draft it and pass it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Furthermore, this form of competition, which consists in an incursion of private interests, those of each financial centre, in the field of public policy, is not entirely without dangers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">However, I believe that this is here a new development that deserves perhaps more attention than it received up to now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.65,0)">Competition between financial structure models: bank finance Vs non-bank finance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.86,0)">I said earlier that I would discuss not one, but two forms of competitions less widely commented upon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The second is, in my view, the competition that has emerged since the introduction of the euro between two models of financial structure, the intermediated model, based on bank lending, and the disintermediated model, based on securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.65,0)">Traditionally, the euro area economy, or most of it at any rate, is dominated by bank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">This contrasts with other economies, such as the United States, for instance, where securities markets have played for a long time a much more significant role in channelling savings towards investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">At the time of the introduction of the euro, there were strong expectations that the broader euro market, relative to legacy currency markets, would allow a development of non-bank finance, and gradual convergence towards the US financial structure model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.42,0)">Two and a half years later, the diagnosis on this specific point is mixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">For instance, at end-1997, bank deposits in the   euro area represented 84% of GDP, while the ratio was only 55% in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.73,0)">At the end of 2000, this situation was essentially unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.71,0)">The ratio of bank deposits to GDP has fallen marginally to 82% in the euro area, while it has remained unchanged at 55% in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.21,0)">Whether bank finance has lost of its importance or not is however, in my view, relatively unimportant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">What I find much more important is that, on the side of bank finance, securities markets have developed to the point where they offer a real alternative for potential borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Even though the stock of outstanding debt securities or the stock market capitalisation of the euro area remains well below that of the US  , both the equity market and the private bond market have experienced unprecedented development over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Let me illustrate this remark by just one point: between January 1999 and the end of 2000, the outstanding amount of bonds issued by non-financial corporations in euro has increased by 60%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">I appreciate that there are lots of caveats that can be opposed to this impressive figure, such as the very small size of the market at the start of the period, or the large share of the net issuance accounted for by non-euro area companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.64,0)">But the lesson to be drawn from this development, in my view, is the following: Prior to the introduction of the euro, borrowers in the legacy currency markets were considerably constrained in terms of the capital they could raise in domestic securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Following the introduction of the euro, issuers have access to a broader and more diversified base of potential investors, which makes it possible to raise capital in much more favourable conditions than previously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.86,0)">An example of this point is the widespread comments heard throughout 1999 and 2000, that many of the large mergers and acquisitions in the euro area would not have been possible, if the purchasers had not been able to finance the transactions by raising capital through the bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">However, the development of non-bank finance is not necessarily, as I mentioned earlier, a panacea that should replace bank-based finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">On the contrary, I regard the co-existence of the two, and competition between the two, as positive, precisely because it provides borrowers with a broader range of options.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">This is likely to allow more entrepreneurs to access capital in the form the most appropriate to their needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It is in this sense that I welcome what I called initially the competition between the two financial structure models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Incidentally, the co-existence of the two modes of financing can be mutually reinforcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">For instance, the closing of the window of opportunity for issuance of equity in the new technology sector in early 2001 has certainly made clear the benefits of being able to raise funds through more traditional bank finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This gives me the opportunity to insist again that I do not have any prejudice in favour of one model of financial structure or another, but that it is rather the existence of a balance between the two models, that I find particularly beneficial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">I find it also noteworthy that also in the United States, the "traditional" European model of universal banking seems now to be attracting much more interest than only a few years ago, as testified by the reform of the Glass-Steagall Act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">At this stage I would like however to underline one prerequisite for the competition between bank finance and non-bank finance to provide all the benefits that one might expect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">This prerequisite is that banks can effectively compete on the same scale as financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">What I mean by this is that commercial banks must be able to become pan-euro area or even global institutions, in the same way as securities markets have become integrated at the level of the euro area or even globally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.65,0)">From that point of view, it is possible that cross-border mergers or acquisitions in the euro area banking sector develop too slowly at the current pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">I see it as important that efforts are made to facilitate this activity, or at least to avoid discouraging it, by identifying and removing remaining obstacles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The limits of competition and the role of public authorities But let me now move to the last part of my intervention, which relates to the role of public authorities in promoting a smooth functioning of the euro area financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Since I have spent a long time praising the benefits of free competition, it is probably fair that I underline at this stage that competition alone does not necessarily allow to reap all the benefits of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.33,0)">Indeed, in a number of cases, the removal of the former obstacles constituted by different currencies has revealed co-ordination problems, that cannot be solved by competition alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Before I illustrate my points with a few examples, I should like to underline that this, I believe, is where the role of public authorities is crucial to ensure that the full benefits of economic and monetary union are obtained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.82,0)">Indeed, almost by definition, public policy consists in the resolution of co-ordination problems between private agents, leading to the production of a public good or the protection of a public interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">But let me immediately provide two examples of how the Eurosystem, as a public authority, has contributed to solving co-ordination problems, where competition could not be effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I underline here that I have chosen two very practical - very down-to-earth - examples, for the sake of simplicity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.05,0)">But the same concepts apply to significantly more complex issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.06,0)">The role of public authorities as facilitators of the resolution of co-ordination problems: the EONIA My first example refers to the calculation of the EONIA reference rate, which, as all of you well know, is a weighted average of the interest rate at which major banks active in the euro market conduct their overnight transactions in the unsecured money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The existence of such a reference rate has some of the properties of a public good, insofar as it has provided the basis for the development of an extremely liquid overnight interest rate swap market, of which no equivalent exists in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">One of the main interests of the EONIA is that it is calculated on actual transactions, not merely on posted or indicative rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">This contributes, inter alia, to the appropriateness of EONIA swaps as a hedging instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">At this stage, I should underline that the EONIA reference rate was not designed by the ECB, nor did the ECB play any leading role in its creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Whereas the creation of the EONIA was a typical example of a co-ordination problem being resolved by market participants themselves, the ECB was involved as a facilitator of this resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What I mean here is that, so that the EONIA could effectively be based on actual transaction rates, it was seen as desirable by market participants that the calculation of the daily EONIA rate be done by a third party, which would receive the contributions of each bank of the panel on a confidential basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is the ECB that was asked to play this role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.89,0)">The role of public authorities as principal in the resolution of co-ordination problems: TARGET A different example of co-ordination problem, of a considerably more serious nature, relates to the situation prevailing at the start of Stage Three of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">You may recall that at the very start of my presentation, I mentioned that the unsecured money market in euro was fully integrated within days of the introduction of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This outcome, however, could not be taken for granted beforehand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Indeed, the full integration of the unsecured money market implied that there existed a means for banks to exchange liquidity across borders, rapidly, smoothly and safely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Only under these circumstances would it be ensured that interest rates for unsecured transactions would equalise across the euro area, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">that there would effectively be a single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.39,0)">This was a typical example of co-ordination problem, insofar as both the banks and the Eurosystem all had a clear interest in the existence of such a payment mechanism across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In the absence of a satisfactory solution, the Eurosystem took upon itself to design and operate such a payment mechanism, which is of course TARGET, and which I do not need to present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The role of TARGET at the time of the introduction of the euro cannot be overestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">In allowing the immediate integration of the whole euro area unsecured money market in the first days of existence of our single currency, it effectively ensured the singleness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.5,0)">The reason why I mentioned this example is because this is one example where public authorities could not act simply as facilitators of the resolution of a co-ordination problem, but had to act as principals in this resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.31,0)">The other merit of this example, in my view, is to highlight the following: the Eurosystem did not integrate the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is the banks themselves, by their activity of arbitraging any remaining difference between interest rates across the euro area, which integrated the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">What the Eurosystem did was to ensure that there existed an environment, where these market forces could be unleashed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The strict implementation of the single monetary policy with a pan-euro area approach and no consideration for the liquidity situation in each country taken individually participated of course to this environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This, I believe, underlines the role of public authorities in the integration of euro area financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.76,0)">The examples I have used are very limited and down-to-earth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.7,0)">When one thinks of public intervention in the field of financial markets, one thinks rather about legislation, such as the work being conducted on European Directives on banking, taxation of savings, or collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">One also thinks about regulation and, for instance, the work recently conducted by the Committee of Wise Men on the regulation of European securities market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But the underlying principle is the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The role of the authorities, in each case, is to create, by the resolution of what are essentially co-ordination problems, a safe and competitive environment, where market forces can effectively express themselves, leading to an efficient allocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Conclusion In the course of my presentation I have touched, however briefly, on a relatively large range of issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The common line to all these issues, and the conclusions that I draw from them all, are the following: Firstly, the introduction of the single currency is a long-term project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Only a small part of the benefits that can be reaped from the existence of the euro have materialised already.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Secondly, so that all these benefits can be obtained, we need to further the process of integration, in particular in the field of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This process is well under way, but it is still far from completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Thirdly, this integration cannot be the fact of public authorities alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Our role is to help resolving co-ordination problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Our role is to create a favourable environment for investment and economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Certainly we, at the European Central Bank, believe that we contribute to this favourable environment by maintaining price stability over the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">But, once again, it is not us who can complete the integration of the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">It is you, the private participants in the market, who can achieve this integration by taking advantage of all the opportunities that are available to you across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">By this means, it is you that will reap, for the benefit of the entire European people, the full benefits of the single currency.</span>
