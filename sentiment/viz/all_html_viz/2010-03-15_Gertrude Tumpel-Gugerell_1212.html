    <span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)"> Introductory remarks to the press conference on the announcement of the EU-funded cooperation programme between the ECB and the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,Sarajevo, 15 March 2010 Dear Governor Kozarić, Dear Ambassador Kourkoulas, Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure for me to be back in Sarajevo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">My last visit was in 2007, when I attended a conference hosted by Governor Kozarić in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Today we have the pleasure to announce the start on 1 April of our second technical cooperation programme, through which we will further the European integration project in the area of central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">We are very pleased to be working in close cooperation with the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina and welcome the opportunity to further intensify this cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">If we look back over the last couple of years, the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina was the first central bank of the current candidate and potential candidate countries for joining the European Union to work closely with the ECB and partner central banks on a needs-analysis project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This work was carried out in 2007 and resulted in a list of recommendations on how to bring the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina into line with EU central banking standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Today, the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina is again taking the lead: it is the first central bank to announce a programme of technical cooperation following an earlier needs analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">I would like to express my gratitude to the Delegation of the European Union to Bosnia and Herzegovina for supporting this programme, during which the European Central Bank   and seven central banks of the euro area will be working closely with our colleagues at the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">I am sure we will, as usual, enjoy a very fruitful working relationship with our colleagues at the Delegation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">We at the ECB, along with our partners, have a keen interest in Bosnia and Herzegovina, in the Western Balkans and in the EU’s neighbouring countries more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Our economies are closely linked, as are our cultures and history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">The financial crisis has been a clear sign that we live in an integrated international economy, where banks and other financial institutions operate across borders and where the markets for financial instruments are truly global.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Many of the banks that operate here in Bosnia and Herzegovina are owned by banks from the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Links between financial institutions and in particular ownership links have for years been considered to be a stabilising factor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The new phenomenon of banks from the old EU Member States taking over or setting up banks in the new Member States or in the Western Balkans was considered good for the transfer of know-how.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The solid capital base of the parent institution and its ability to support the subsidiary in case of difficulties in the local market were highlighted as other advantages of such ownership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.38,0)">The current financial crisis has shown, however, that these links can create spillovers and that these spillovers between entities in a group can go both ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">In Bosnia and Herzegovina, we have seen a rather stable development with, so far, no apparent destabilising effects resulting from such ownerships.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">I believe that there are a number of reasons for the success in maintaining stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">First, I think we have to recognise that the authorities in the countries hosting subsidiaries of banks from the European Union have applied and ensured compliance with adequate prudential rules that did not allow local banks to be highly leveraged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Second, the so-called “Vienna Initiative” or European Bank Coordination Initiative under the leadership of the IMF,   has been an important instrument for continuing the support of subsidiaries, and maintaining the functioning of local markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Third, I believe that the good relationship between central banks and supervisory authorities has been instrumental in maintaining an open dialogue and in identifying solutions where such solutions were needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Overall, let me emphasize that we have to remain vigilant and attentive to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">We must work together to find the best solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.38,0)">These have to be global and regional; they certainly cannot be national in an integrated market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Let me now say a few words about the programme of technical cooperation with Governor Kozarić and his team that we are announcing today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">We are very pleased that you, Mr Governor, on behalf of your board and staff, have invited the Eurosystem to work with you again on this technical cooperation programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The aspirations of Bosnia and Herzegovina to join the European Union and its status as a potential EU candidate country imply the need to adapt to EU rules and standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Once the overall conditions are met and Bosnia and Herzegovina joins the European Union, the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina will join the European System of Central Banks, and it is therefore also important to continue working towards compliance with the standards and rules relating to central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">We have seen a lot of progress on many of the recommendations made by us in 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.6,0)">One example is the publication of a financial stability report, which you have today on your website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The areas for this upcoming technical assistance were identified by you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Your management and staff have been working closely with the ECB’s project management team – present here today – to define your specific goals and the working methods you will use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">I think that the programme that will start on 1 April is very ambitious and I am confident that, together, we can achieve what we are setting out to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">During the next 18 months you will be working closely with experts from the ECB as well as with experts from national central banks of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">I am very pleased that we have found leading experts who will be able to support you in the areas of your choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">What will we be working on?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">First, there are three areas that were covered during the needs analysis programme: statistics; economic analysis and research; and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Then there are the new areas: these relate to legal harmonisation, improvements in your IT resources, and coordination of your integration with the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">There will be a need to coordinate efforts in the six different areas and for expert support in some areas on a day-to-day basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This will be the main task of Ms Mara Vyborny, a central bank expert with experience from the Oesterreichische Nationalbank and the European Central Bank, who will be our Resident Programme Coordinator here in Sarajevo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Mara is here today, and I would like to wish her every success in this undertaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The analysis of the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s current status in relation to reaching the targets of the programme and the ensuing guidance on how to do so will be carried out and provided by the ECB, together with colleagues from the national central banks of Germany, Greece, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and Slovenia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">I would like to warmly greet the representatives from several of these participating central banks who have accompanied me here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">As was the case when we worked together in 2007, I am sure that we will find you, Mr Governor, and your staff to be highly motivated partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">From our side, rest assured that you will be able to rely upon our commitment and enthusiasm, both on the part of the ECB and of the partner central banks and their respective experts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">I would like to wish all parties involved the very best of luck.</span>
