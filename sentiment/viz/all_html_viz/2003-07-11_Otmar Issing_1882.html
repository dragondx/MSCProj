    <span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)"> ECB Watchers Conference: The evaluation of the strategy Opening remarks Professor Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank,Frankfurt, 11 July 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Introduction I welcome the opportunity to address this fifth edition of the ECB Watchers conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This annual meeting has become a tradition by now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is a remarkable tradition: to my knowledge, the ECB is the only central bank that regularly intervenes in meetings of this kind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">When, four and a half years ago, the ECB started conducting monetary policy for the euro area, we decided to participate in this initiative launched by the CFS as we felt the need, as a new central bank, to quickly establish active channels of debate with the market, academic, and press communities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">We now continue to benefit from these meetings on a regular basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">I wish to thank Prof. Weber for proposing this formula and for maintaining his commitment over the years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This meeting is a special one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In the course of the last year the ECB has launched, conducted and concluded an evaluation of its monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">A good deal of the remarks today naturally focus on such evaluation, its conclusions as announced on 8 May, and the changes – or lack of changes – that this review process led to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Accordingly, my short remarks this morning will be centered on three points: Why has the ECB decided to undertake an evaluation of its strategy; How was this evaluation conducted; What conclusions we reached, and why.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Why an evaluation of the strategy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Many people were surprised by the announcement, last December, that the ECB would undertake an evaluation of its monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.31,0)">Some took it as an implicit indication that we were dissatisfied by the strategy and prepared to change it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.82,0)">The opposite is true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.28,0)">When our strategy was announced, on October 1998, the ECB had not yet assumed its responsibility of conducting monetary policy for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The strategy we designed was a novel one, suited for the special characteristics of the euro area and its central bank, and different in a number of respects from other current and past strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.55,0)">It incorporated the best judgement and experience of central banks and the key lessons of economic research, but it lacked one fundamental element: the test of practical experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Hence it was only natural that, after a period of time, the Council would want to go back and reflect on the accumulated experience in a systematic way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This did not mean that changes were necessarily needed – any more than a new car necessarily needs repair when it is taken to the garage for its 5.000 miles checkup!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">It is true, however, that we undertook our evaluation with an open mind, ready to introduce changes in case our evaluation had suggested the need to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">There are in my view three areas where a monetary policy strategy plays a crucial role in a central bank, and this is where our attention focused: The strategy should provide a framework for the internal analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">As such, the framework must encompass and organize all relevant information in an efficient way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">It should use the best available research, taking into account all different sources of uncertainty the central bank faces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Competing models must be allowed to paint complementary pictures of the economic outlook and the risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The strategy should also provide a framework for the debate within the decision making body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">From this viewpoint, the strategy must be efficient in terms of allowing the decision making body to examine and weigh all relevant information, encompassing any diversity of views that may exist on the transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Finally, the strategy should provide a framework for external communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Here, transparency and effectiveness are linked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Effective communication facilitates the transmission of monetary policy decisions to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">At the same time, using the same framework for external communication as for internal analysis should guarantee consistency and improve public understanding of how monetary policy is conducted, thereby enhancing transparency and effectiveness at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">How was the evaluation conducted?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Accordingly, we went through several steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.55,0)">The first was to revisit all the technical issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">All aspects of the strategy were scrutinized, going through a lively internal debate and resulting in a series of technical studies now available on our web site.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The key role here was played by the staff of the ECB and of the National Central Banks, the latter contributing through the Eurosystem Monetary Policy Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Use was made of research accumulated during the recent years, in the ECB and outside, on a number of issues relevant for the strategy, such as the transmission of monetary policy, the determinants of prices, the leading indicator properties of money, credit and other key indicators, and the like.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The second step was to reflect on how the strategy has contributed to the debate within the ECB decision making bodies, naturally with a particular focus on the Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">In the decade leading up to the EMU, a broad consensus on the principles of sound monetary policy making emerged among the NCB's now forming the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Even so, the ECB Governing Council is a large body, with a wealth of diverse experiences and views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The strategy must provide a commonly accepted framework within which these experiences and views all contribute to policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">The strategy should also ensure that the relevant information is taken into account fully and orderly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">From this point of view, the ultimate test for the success of the strategy are the extent to which it effectively guides the debate within the Council and the record of actual policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">I think it is fair to say that most observers agree that the ECB's record has been, on the whole, very successful in these four and a half years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Finally, we carefully considered the performance of the strategy in external communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.31,0)">This is an area where, according to several observers, including some present here today, the strategy has worked less well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We have examined the full range of views, including those coming from the Watchers' meetings and those expressed by market participants, academics, and the press.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Our announcements regarding the strategy on 8th of May, which I am now going to discuss briefly, are aimed primarily at addressing certain misunderstandings that have emerged in our communication with the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The result of the evaluation I do not need to discuss here all aspects of our review; the documents in our website provide a complete account of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The issues we investigated included the choice of the specific index used to define price stability, the preference accorded to headline as opposed to "core" inflation, how to deal with inflation differentials within the area, the stability of the euro area money demand function, and many others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.19,0)">I will limit my remarks to the two most debated aspects: the definition of price stability and the role of money, or the "two-pillar structure" of the strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The definition of price stability Regarding the definition of price stability, the Governing Council confirmed the explicit quantitative definition announced already in October 1998, which is based on an objective and transparent measure, as provided by the HICP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">We remain convinced that this is an important element of clarity, that contributes positively to both the effectiveness of policy and to the ECB's accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Moreover, the Council noted that this quantitative definition had been very successful in anchoring market expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The direct and indirect measures of expected inflation in the euro area have shown a remarkable stability in the last few years, at a level just below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">This is a very important result, perhaps the most important, for a central bank whose mandate is to maintain price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Hence, the essence of the existing definition of price stability, namely, a year-on-year increase in the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2%, was fully confirmed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">At the same time, the Governing Council clarified that in the pursuit of price stability it will aim to maintain inflation rates below, but close to 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">This clarification emphasizes the need for a sufficient safety margin against the risk of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">There are several good reasons for accepting a low rate of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.94,0)">The major concern is the fact that monetary policy may become less effective, if interest rate management by the central bank is constrained by a liquidity trap or a "zero bound" problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.5,0)">ECB analyses show that such constraint should not pose a significant threat if inflation remains sufficiently above zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The clarification we provided to the price stability definition offers a safeguard in this sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In preventing the emergence of deflationary and inflationary dynamics alike, a forward-looking orientation of monetary policy is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">There is no convincing evidence that relying on rigid rules helps in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Rather, the medium term orientation of the ECB strategy, with its explicit reference to all relevant indicators of future price developments, provides flexibility and forward- looking orientation while maintaining a firm reference to the medium term price stability goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">The role of money and the two-pillar framework The Governing Council confirmed that the two-pillar framework of the strategy is an effective tool to organize the information on different risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Different types of analysis provide information relevant for price developments at different time horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The economic analysis – focusing on the most proximate causes of inflation such as cost developments and demand-supply imbalances – primarily contributes to assess short to medium-term economic developments and consequently risks to price stability at that horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The monetary analysis – focusing instead on the ultimate monetary determinants of inflation – primarily contains information for assessing price developments at medium to long-term horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The economic literature suggests that there is no easy way to bring together the monetary analysis with the economic analysis in a unified framework; or, as we could say more technically, to integrate money and credit into today's standard macroeconomic models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In this respect, the monetary analysis mainly serves as a means of cross-checking, from a medium to long-term perspective, the short to medium-term indications coming from economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.24,0)">In particular, to underscore the longer-term nature of the reference value for monetary growth, which is retained as a benchmark for the assessment of monetary developments, the Governing Council decided to discontinue the practice of an annual review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The ECB's monetary policy strategy will continue to provide a solid basis to tackle further challenges ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">I am sure that over time the merits of our approach will be fully recognized.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It is very open and transparent about the presence of the uncertainty surrounding the functioning of the economy and the reliability of key economic relationships, which necessitate a diversified approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In particular, a prominent role for money underpins the medium-term orientation of monetary policy and helps eschew excessive policy activism and overly ambitious attempts to "fine-tune" economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">The two-pillar strategy also provides a suitable framework to take asset price developments appropriately into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">More than four years of experience provide evidence of the success of the strategy as the basis for monetary policy decisions in the face of significant uncertainty and sizable adverse shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The evidence shows that the ECB is on the right track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">It has earned credibility, fulfilled the stability mandate given to it by the Treaty and will continue to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is in the end what counts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Conclusions In concluding let me stress, as I always do when discussing these issues, that our reflection on the strategy is an ongoing process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.14,0)">It did not start with the recent evaluation and will not end with it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.07,0)">We continuously reexamine the performance of our strategy while we work with it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.64,0)">Hence I am sure that your job as Watchers, and occasionally as critics, is not finished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">We continue to look forward to your feedback and need your constructive critique, not only in the short term - but also over the medium to long term.</span>
