    <span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)"> Introductory remarks Remarks by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the High-Level Meeting on Cyber Resilience, Frankfurt am Main, 19 June 2017 Introduction It is a pleasure to welcome you here today to this strategic high-level meeting on cyber resilience for pan-European financial market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The aim of bringing together high-level representatives from large European market infrastructures, critical service providers and public authorities is threefold: First we would like to gain a deeper understanding of the cyber threat landscape in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The European Union Agency for Network and Information Security   will make a presentation on the cyber threat landscape and its relevance for the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Second, we will share with you the Eurosystem’s cyber strategy for financial market infrastructures and also explain ECB Banking Supervision’s approach to the issue of bank cyber resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Third, we would like to hear your views on how we can all collaborate in a trusted environment to enhance the cyber resilience of financial market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">More specifically, we would like to assess with you how much interest there is in creating a high-level cyber resilience forum for pan-European financial market infrastructures, critical service providers and competent authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Before we start, let me briefly set the scene.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The evolving cyber threat landscape in Europe Besides the undeniable advantages of information and communication technology, the increase in users and data on digital platforms, in cloud computing and across networks has also created greater opportunities for cybercrime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.03,0)">There are a variety of agents involved: criminals, hacktivists or nation states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.03,0)">They may have different motives: financial gain, espionage, disruption and destabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">But what they all have in common is that they are steadily increasing their level of sophistication and exploring ways of attacking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">A sound operational risk management and IT security framework are the first line of defence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">But resilience to cyberattacks means more than that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Unlike critical failures, the likelihood of cyberattacks cannot be mitigated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">A paradigm shift is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.63,0)">We have to accept that cyberattacks are inevitable and that attackers are persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Consequently, we have to establish how – in case of persistent attacks – we prioritise our operations and resources, protect our key assets and restore functionalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Cyber resilience goes beyond technology, it also encompasses governance, company culture and business processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Given the extensive interlinkages and interdependencies in the financial system, it is obvious that markets’ overall cyber resilience depends not only on the resilience of each individual market actor but also on that of interconnected market infrastructures, participants and service providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The Eurosystem cyber strategy for financial market infrastructures Following the increase in both the frequency and severity of cyberattacks over the last few years, legislators, regulators and standard setters have issued legislation and guidance on cyber security at national and international level and at cross-sectoral as well as sector-specific level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Let me briefly mention three initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">First, in 2016, the EC adopted the Directive on security of network and information systems  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Its aim is to bring the cybersecurity capabilities of operators of essential services to the same level of development in all the EU Member States and to ensure an efficient exchange of information and good cooperation on the topic throughout the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Second, at international level, the G7 countries have drawn up a set of fundamental elements of cybersecurity for the financial sector, as well as three further recommendations on the effectiveness of cybersecurity assessments, third-party risks, and coordination with other critical sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Third, with a key focus on financial stability, the CPMI-IOSCO published a principles-based “Guidance on cyber resilience for financial market infrastructures” in June 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Supplementing the “Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures”, it provides additional detail related to the preparations and measures that financial market infrastructures should undertake to enhance their cyber resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">In recognition of the escalating cyber threats, the legislative and regulatory guidance and the required paradigm shift, the Eurosystem’s overseers have launched a strategy for cyber resilience in relation to financial market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This strategy – which will be explained in more detail at agenda item 3 – is built on three pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The first pillar refers to the cyber resilience of individual financial market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The second pillar refers to the resilience of the financial sector as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The third pillar highlights the importance of establishing a forum which brings together market actors, competent authorities and the cybersecurity service providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This brings me to the third and final objective of today’s meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Creation of a high-level cyber resilience forum Tackling cyber risk is not for regulators or market actors in isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Rather it is a collaborative endeavour that must be undertaken together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Hence, I invite you to seriously consider the creation of a high-level cyber resilience forum for pan-European financial market infrastructures, critical service providers and competent authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">I am convinced that there is cross-fertilisation and collective learning to be gained from such collaboration and I am looking forward to a fruitful meeting today.</span>
