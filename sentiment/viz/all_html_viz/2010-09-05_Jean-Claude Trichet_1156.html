    <span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)"> Celebration of the 130th anniversary of Banca Naţională a României Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB at the gala event Bucharest, 5 September 2010 Dear President, Dear Prime Minister, Your Excellencies, Dear Governor Isărescu, Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour and a pleasure for me to be here this evening to address you on the occasion of the 130th anniversary of Banca Naţională a României.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">I should like to start by thanking my colleague, Governor Isărescu, for inviting me to this event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">This is not my first visit to Banca Naţională a României, and I would like to tell you that it is always a real pleasure to be here thanks to the warm welcome extended by the Romanian National Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Banca Naţională a României has good reason to proudly celebrate this historic date: the achievements of the last 130 years have been manifold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The National Bank of Romania, like most other central banks with a long history, did not come into being as the institution we know today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It has evolved over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Since its establishment in April 1880 it has progressively acquired new functions and duties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Over time it has also established close relationships with the banking and financial system, both at home and at the international level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">There are good reasons why the Romanian National Bank has become one of the most respected public institutions in this country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Over the last 130 years, Banca Naţională a României, like the Romanian nation itself, has been confronted with several major challenges, including the historic events of 1989 and the ensuing economic transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The cooperation between the ECB and Banca Naţională a României began well before the actual accession of Romania to the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In October 2004, for example, I visited the central bank to meet with Governor Isărescu and the Executive Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The aim of this visit was to prepare the ground for the future cooperation between the European System of Central Banks   and the National Bank of Romania in anticipation of the EU membership of Romania.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Since then the integration of Banca Naţională a României into the European System of Central Banks has proceeded smoothly, and the work carried out by the central bank’s managers in the respective ESCB committees has been highly appreciated for its dedication and very high standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Let me take this opportunity to state how important is Central Bank independence, which is called for by the European Union legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">There can be no doubt that over the past years the Romanian economy has accomplished significant progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.17,0)">Yet, as we all know, the economic situation was, and still is, extremely challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.34,0)">The Romanian economy, like many others, has been hard hit by the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Its adjustment is supported by a financial agreement of the European Union and the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.91,0)">Indeed, a challenging fiscal, financial and structural adjustment process is called for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">I am convinced that this will help to lay the foundations for a sustainable process of further convergence on the part of the Romanian economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The ECB is closely involved in monitoring this adjustment programme, reflecting its profound interest in Romania and the development of its economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Let me take this opportunity to congratulate Banca Naţională a României for the conduct of its monetary policy in such difficult circumstances and for its contribution to the financial stability of the country thanks to its sound supervisory policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">I would also like to encourage the Romanian government in implementing the bold decisions that were and are necessary in the domain of economic and financial policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.92,0)">But this is no time for complacency in any respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It remains essential both for Romania and for other economies to pursue the reform process very actively and to pave the way for sustainable macroeconomic developments, including sound fiscal policy, which are so essential in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There is no substitute for sound and stability-oriented economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">That is why I should like to encourage the Romanian authorities to remain ambitious in pursuing sound and stability-oriented economic policies that can bring sustainable economic growth in the medium and long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This applies, in particular, to the conduct of fiscal policy and to the implementation of timely and consistent structural reforms that support the sustainability of the convergence process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">All economic policy actors, without exception, need to be committed to the achievement of this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">At the ECB we stand ready to maintain and reinforce our dialogue with Banca Naţională a României, a dialogue that has proven very fruitful in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">I am confident that our excellent working relationship will continue to serve both our institutions well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Happy birthday, National Bank of Romania!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">La mulţi ani Băncii Naţionale a României!</span>
