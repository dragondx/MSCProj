    <span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)"> The ECB’s monetary policy in the pandemic: meeting the challenge Speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 62nd NABE Annual Meeting “Global Reset?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Economics, Business, and Policy in the Pandemic” 6 October 2020 I will provide a brief assessment of the macroeconomic outlook, discuss the ECB’s monetary policy response to the pandemic crisis and explain our current monetary policy challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.1,0)">The macroeconomic outlook We expect about half of the cumulative decline in output in the first half of the year to have been reversed during the third quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Compared with the trough, this initial recovery phase is visible across a wide range of economic indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.24,0)">That said, the euro area economy is still operating far below its pre-pandemic level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.76,0)">While this in part can be attributed to ongoing supply-side interruptions, the speed of the recovery is also held back by a lack of buoyancy in demand conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.15,0)">Meanwhile, the resurgence in infection rates   is posing renewed challenges, especially for those sectors most affected by social distancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.43,0)">Reflecting this, the momentum in the services sector has been slowing down since August, while the services business activity PMI fell back into contractionary territory in September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.83,0)">As a result, given the importance of services to the euro area economy, the euro area composite PMI also declined, even if it remained in expansionary territory at 50.4.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.97,0)">In this environment, many households are uncertain about future employment and wage dynamics, motivating them to save more for precautionary purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.53,0)">Similarly, firms are uncertain about future demand for their products and are grappling with weakened balance sheets, leading to cancellations and delays in investment plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This assessment underpins the baseline scenario of the September ECB staff macroeconomic projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.76,0)">Despite the recovery in the second half of the year, output at the end of 2020 is projected to remain about 5.2 percent below the level of output at the end of 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Economic activity is foreseen to return to pre-pandemic levels only towards the end of 2022, with output expected to expand by 5.0 percent in 2021 and 3.2 percent in 2022.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In any event, the range of possible outcomes in the projections remains very wide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.01,0)">This is illustrated by the alternative projection scenarios  , as shown in     The pandemic shock has left its mark on inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.32,0)">Euro area HICP inflation has been declining for several months: after turning negative to minus 0.2 percent in August, the flash estimate for September signals a further decline to minus 0.3 percent in September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.65,0)">While some temporary factors   have contributed to this sharp decline, the drop in inflation also reflects weaker underlying pricing pressures across both the goods and services sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">We expect headline inflation to remain negative for the remainder of the year, before returning to positive territory in early 2021.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The elevated level of economic slack, weak energy inflation and the recent appreciation of the euro are expected to continue to act as headwinds, such that our baseline projections expect average headline inflation only to gradually rise towards 1.0 percent in 2021 and 1.3 percent in 2022  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.88,0)">In parallel to the general economic outlook, there is considerable uncertainty surrounding this baseline projection, as indicated by the range of inflation outcomes that are spanned by the mild and severe scenarios for the inflation outlook in     The monetary policy response An accommodative monetary policy configuration was already in place before the pandemic: in September 2019, the main policy rate   was lowered to minus 0.5 percent and there was a resumption of net asset purchases at a rate of €20 billion per month under our baseline asset purchase programme  , with these measures reinforced by forward guidance that ties future monetary policy to the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In addition, credit supply was supported by the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">In the initial response to the pandemic crisis, we adopted a comprehensive package of complementary measures, which are illustrated in   In combination with the forceful fiscal responses at national and EU level, these measures have been successful in stabilising financial markets and protecting credit supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The additional quantitative easing provided by the PEPP programme also eases the overall monetary stance, acting to reduce economic slack and boost inflation dynamics over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">The ECB reconfirmed its forward guidance on the path of policy interest rates and the APP throughout this period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">With the launch of the PEPP, our range of monetary policy measures currently consists of four main instruments:   the setting of our policy rates  ;   the baseline asset purchase programme  ;   the pandemic-specific temporary asset purchase programme  ; and   the TLTRO III programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Our forward guidance about the future setting of our policy measures plays a central role in determining our overall monetary stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In relation to our policy rates, our current forward guidance links future rate-setting to the inflation outlook; in turn, net purchases and reinvestment under the APP are linked to the rate path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The temporary nature of the PEPP means that the forward guidance is connected to the pandemic: net asset purchases will continue until at least the end of June 2021 and, in any case, until the Governing Council judges that the coronavirus crisis phase is over; reinvestment will be maintained until at least the end of 2022 and, in any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In terms of interest rate policy, the Governing Council expects to keep policy rates at their current or lower levels until we have seen the inflation outlook robustly converge to our inflation aim within our projection horizon, and such convergence has been consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">The concept of robust convergence signals that we require a high degree of confidence that the inflation outlook has durably approached the inflation aim, while the condition that convergence should also be evident in realised underlying inflation means that future rate tightening will not run ahead of the hard data in terms of the out-turns for underlying inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Given this “double hurdle” set of conditions, our forward guidance represents a strong commitment to keep financial conditions at highly accommodative levels for as long as necessary to lift inflation to our inflation aim in a sustainable fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In line with our forward guidance, market-based expectations of future policy rates and the future path of the APP have adjusted in response to changes to the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Compared to September 2019,   Through these endogenous market responses, our forward guidance acts as an automatic stabiliser through the adjustment of monetary policy expectations – and hence the entire spectrum of monetary conditions – to changes in the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The combination of our pre-pandemic and pandemic-specific monetary policy measures has successfully contributed to the stabilisation of markets and has thereby helped to ensure the smooth transmission of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">As shown in     The TLTROs were in high demand in June and September 2020, with a combined take-up of nearly €1.5 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In net terms, liquidity increased by €706 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The high take-up, together with the intended use   that banks have reported in surveys, suggests that we can expect our targeted operations to have a sizeable impact on the provision of financing by banks to their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Our estimates show that TLTRO III liquidity can be expected to boost loan volumes considerably, to the tune of 3 percentage points cumulatively by 2022.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In addition, the euro area bank lending survey indicates that TLTRO funding has been effective in easing the terms and conditions that banks apply in their lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The red bar measures the take-up of banks that, in the ECB Banking Supervision survey on TLTRO III.4 use conducted in July 2020, reported that more than 50% of the funds will be allocated as a substitute for market funding sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The blue bar measures the same take-up by banks that intend to allocate the majority of funds for granting loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The yellow bar represents the take-up by banks that intend to allocate the majority of funds to uses other than substituting market funding or granting loans  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.8,0)">The green bar reports the take-up by banks that do not plan to allocate the majority of funds in any of the three categories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The bars in the left and central columns measure the distribution across expected uses of the TLTRO III take-up in the December 2019 and March 2020 operations, respectively, based on responses to the January and April 2020 bank lending surveys, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.05,0)">Shaded areas represent the take-up of banks that change their expected use of funds between survey waves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.45,0)">The latest observations are for August 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.18,0)">Meeting the monetary policy challenge The pandemic represents a significant monetary policy challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.59,0)">Weak demand and rising economic slack have added to disinflationary pressures in an environment that is already characterised by low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.39,0)">As I set out in my speech at this year’s Jackson Hole conference,   The initial negative impact of the pandemic shock on inflation is illustrated by the shift from “A” to “B”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.19,0)">The monetary policy challenge since the onset of the pandemic crisis can be divided into two stages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">In the first stage, the challenge for the ECB is to counter the negative inflation shock caused by the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">One option would have been to simply accept a longer period of low inflation and an even more protracted path towards our inflation aim  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, this option is not desirable for a number of reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.97,0)">First, it would be very costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.81,0)">It would imply higher real interest rates, thereby weakening the recovery of investment and consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.39,0)">Second, it would also be a high-risk option: by tolerating a protracted period of even lower inflation, it might foster a downward drift in inflation expectations that could ultimately become entrenched, making it even more difficult for us to deliver our inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.91,0)">This is particularly relevant in the current euro area context, with an already long period of below-target inflation before the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Instead, a less costly and more prudent approach is to add sufficient extra monetary policy accommodation to boost inflation momentum towards the upper region of the “BCDE” zone, in order to reconnect to the pre-pandemic inflation path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The central element in this first stage has been the introduction of the PEPP and the subsequent recalibration of its size and duration, in order to provide an intense phase of extra net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">However, the challenge that already existed before the pandemic will also remain even after the negative pandemic shock to the inflation path is offset: the timely convergence of inflation to our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Accordingly, the second stage of our monetary policy challenge is to deliver this goal: once we have returned towards the pre-pandemic inflation path, we have to ensure that our monetary policy stance is appropriately calibrated in order to ensure timely and robust convergence to our medium-term inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">In both the first and second stages of the monetary policy challenge, fiscal policy will play an important role in the transmission of our monetary policy: all else being equal, fiscal multipliers are higher in the current environment in which our current policy measures and forward guidance are supporting a low level for the yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.77,0)">In terms of the initial impact of the pandemic, its adverse impact on the economy would have been significantly worse in the absence of countercyclical fiscal policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The innovative nature and scale of the Next Generation EU recovery fund has also clearly contributed to the significant reduction in average sovereign bond yields and enhanced the prospect of a sustained recovery across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Looking forward, the area-wide fiscal policy stance   for 2021 and beyond will play a crucial macroeconomic role, subject to the quality of the design and implementation of fiscal programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In terms of policy making, the ECB Governing Council will carefully assess the incoming information with regard to its implications for the medium-term inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Furthermore, the current monetary policy strategy review exercise provides an excellent opportunity to revisit the strategic underpinnings of our monetary policy, in order to ensure we are maximising our effectiveness and efficiency in delivering our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">I am grateful to Demosthenes Ioannou and Nick Ligthart for their contributions to this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.1,0)">The June Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections expected average annual output to decline by 8.7 percent in 2020 but expand by 5.2 percent in 2021 and a further 3.3 percent in 2022.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.21,0)">The incoming data have been broadly in line with our expectations: the latest September ECB staff macroeconomic projections see an output decline of 8.0 percent in 2020 and expansions of 5.0 percent in 2021 and 3.2 percent in 2022.   and Zlatanos, S.  , “COVID-19 and the increase in household savings: precautionary or forced?”, Economic Bulletin, Issue 6, ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.53,0)">This development is also broadly reflected in the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator for September, which showed services demand expectations waning for the second month in a row.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Overall, services confidence registered an increase in September, thanks to managers reporting views that are much less negative about the past business situation and past demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.08,0)">However, the level of sentiment in the services sector remained low compared with other sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">For more extensive discussions of our policy response to the pandemic, see Lane, P.R.</span><span

before we start raising the key ECB interest rates.” We intend to “continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when we start increasing interest rates, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.”  R.  , “The
