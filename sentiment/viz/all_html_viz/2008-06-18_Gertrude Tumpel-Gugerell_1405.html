    <span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)"> Towards an integrated securities market – The TARGET2-Securities project Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the 12th FESE ConventionStockholm, 18 June 2008 Ladies and gentlemen, I am delighted to be here today at the FESE convention to share with you my vision of the T2S initiative, and its important role in creating an integrated European securities market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But let me start by putting the T2S project into the broader context of overall financial integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">I am often asked why we need to integrate financial markets There is enough economic evidence to convince even the most hardened sceptic that financial integration at European level will create substantial gains for society as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Financial integration will foster a more efficient allocation of resources, increase competition, reduce costs, lead to higher trading activity, and more transparent pricing and thereby raise the overall potential for stronger economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">It will increase consumer choice, open a multitude of new investment opportunities, strengthen the EU banking sector and make Europe a centre for financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Moreover, more from my perspective as a central banker, increased financial integration will enhance the smooth transmission of monetary policy and is crucial for global resilience of financial markets which constitutes an important element for safeguarding financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Efficient integrated markets generally reinforce the shock-absorbing capacity of the economic system as they offer a wider range of options for sharing risk among economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">The economic gains of financial integration coincide with the objectives expressed in the Lisbon agenda, of granting the citizens of Europe access to a genuine single market in which financial services are offered on the same conditions within and across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Thus every cross-border business in Europe needs to become truly domestic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Achieving this requires action of several kinds at all stages in the process – in trading and in post-trading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">I think there is evidence of already great progress on the trading side; notably, European Stock Exchanges and the relatively new MTFs   are extending the range of instruments offered on their trading platforms to create genuine competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This offers the potential for lower costs for intermediaries and all classes of investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">It also improves the prospects for retail investors to diversify their securities portfolios across Europe, increasing the potential returns on investments and diversifying their exposure to financial risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Issuers should also benefit from greater market depth for their fund raising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.82,0)">But what about the post trading arena?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">There is considerable evidence that costs in the European post trading area are much higher – particularly for cross border activity - than in other very large markets, such as the US market, but also several markets of the Eastern Hemisphere states The cost gap – for example – in relation to the US market arises in large part because of differences between different European local markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.11,0)">The lack of harmonisation is often the result of history - differences in market practices, laws, tax administration and so on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Often, the post trading infrastructure in the local market has been rapidly developed in the relatively recent past to provide very efficient means of accommodating such local market features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The solutions were often created under huge pressure, to help each individual market to cope with the dynamics of innovation and of trading volumes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">These were major achievements in that context, but the world has changed and we now need to move to the next stage of development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Our today’s task is, therefore, to become more competitive in a rapidly changing global financial market environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Differences across Europe’s post trading markets have to be overcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">For this, integration and harmonization need to be promoted, synergies need to be used and economies of scale have to be exploited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This will foster competition and the expansion of markets, facilitating a more efficient allocation of better-priced capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">We, the Eurosystem, contribute our part in promoting further financial integration in the post trading sector by acting in several roles - as market operator, facilitator and catalyst.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">The Eurosystem already offers core, neutral and borderless infrastructure to support real-time settlement in central bank money with the TARGET2 system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Moreover, we are working to produce the next generation of the Eurosystem’s collateral management system  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">The Eurosystem also supports market initiatives such as SEPA - the new Single Euro Payments Area – enabling customers to make payments anywhere in the euro area as quickly, safely and easily as they can in their own country, by using a single set of payment instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">How can the TARGET2-Securities initiative contribute to this process?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me focus today on the Eurosystem’s TARGET2-Securities initiative  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">T2S is a proposal to overcome the fragmentation in the European market for securities settlement providing a harmonised venue, a single European, borderless, settlement platform, offering highly secure delivery versus payment for any security, using central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">T2S reinforces the other main European Union initiatives, the Code of Conduct for clearing and settlement, the Giovannini harmonisation process and of course the MiFiD in driving forward the single market objectives set out by the Lisbon agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In particular, T2S will be tightly integrated with the TARGET2 system, combining cash and securities settlements in a single shared platform in real time to provide the single European settlement platform for securities in central bank money, irrespective of the location of the issuer, the security or the settlement counterparty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">This will create a single pool of securities available to market users and service providers through their chosen CSD, eliminating the costly process of cross-border security settlement in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In this way, T2S will provide - just like an airport servicing various airlines - a basic infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In this basic infrastructure the CSDs can operate, offering - for example - a mix of products and services to their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In this regard, T2S will simply provide the basic platform that offers its services to all CDSs at the same unit costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">This will obviously contribute to more competition among the CSDs, leading to more transparent and efficient pricing, and facilitating competition to provide cross-border trading venues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This will create substantial gains for the European financial industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Thanks to efforts made by hundreds of experts from over 80 European institutions and from the Eurosystem over the last year, the Governing Council of the ECB has been able in the last few weeks to invite the European CSDs to express their support for T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We have sent the European CSDs detailed user requirements, an economic impact analysis, a description of governance for the next project phase, and a presentation on harmonisation efforts in the context of T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">These are the outcome of a transparent and constructive consultation process, cooperating with CSDs and market users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me just point to a few elements of the economic impact study which you can find on our website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This analysis confirms that the economic benefits of T2S will be substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Despite using rather conservative assumptions it shows that T2S has the potential to bring significant benefits to both the securities market participants in particular and to the European economy in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The analysis concludes that the costs of settlement can be reduced substantially from the 73 cents a CSD charges on average in the euro area   today to 32 cents per transaction under T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.61,0)">The T2S benefits would be even higher if the CSDs of the UK, Sweden, Denmark and Switzerland were to join; in such a scenario the T2S settlement cost would decline to 21 cents, and the annual savings would range between EUR 220 million and EUR 340 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These numbers represent only the narrow business case, and do not capture – of course – the full dynamic impact of T2S arising from enhanced competition in a more complete single market for security settlement and related services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.47,0)">The Commission estimates the impact on EU welfare of such post-trading cost reductions to be in the range of EUR 1.1 billion to 1.6 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Let me stress very clearly that while there is room for much discussion about the exact estimates I just mentioned, we definitely cannot contest the overall benefits of a more competitive and more integrated European financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">You may wonder why I call for more competition but at the same time offer only one single settlement engine for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.75,0)">The answer is in two parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">First, the alternative to what we offer is the creation of many cross CSD settlement links, which have to be highly efficient and safe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.47,0)">This has not been realised today, partly because of cost and partly because of commercial dynamics; and I suspect it would take many years for a suitable such network to become a reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">It is very likely that the cost and time would be better employed in providing cross border asset servicing, which is of course necessary to take full advantage of borderless settlement in T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This activity is high value-added, and can involve taking commercial risk; it is a clear priority for investment and effort by the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Second - in my view - there is unlikely to be much benefit in the form of innovation gains from preserving a multiplicity of competing platforms; and there is in any case likely to be competition from settlement in commercial bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Let me also stress that integration and harmonisation have become a core objective of the European Union; the European financial industry is requested to increase competitiveness by giving access to an efficient, state of the art financial infrastructure supporting a true single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">In this respect, T2S has been developed with harmonisation in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">T2S will deliver and embody a significant amount of settlement harmonisation in important areas such as common interfaces, common set of rules for intra-day settlement finality, a common daily timetable, and common messages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">These features are an immediate contribution to the elimination of 6 of the 15 so-called Giovannini barriers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">For the future, we expect T2S to foster greater harmonisation efforts beyond the area of pure settlement, addressing more barriers – as already addressed in the current concept of T2S - of the kind identified by the Giovannini Group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Accordingly a Harmonisation Group will be established by the T2S Advisory Group to agree and implement an action plan for harmonisation with the support of market leaders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is likely to be necessary to harmonise market practices for – among others - repo instructions, collateral management procedures, auto collateralisation and multilateral settlements without a central counterparty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">And on top of this I expect that changes in legislation - where there is a credible consensus within the market that these produce significant benefits - will be proposed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Before coming to an end, let me come back again to the decision that lies ahead of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Since the participation of CSDs in the T2S project is voluntary, the ECB has asked all European CSDs to express - by 4 July 2008 – whether they support T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">We are sure that CSDs will consult their clients and other stakeholders, many of whom have already expressed strong support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">I would like to encourage all of you to express your views so that CSDs have a sound basis to decide on the future of the European settlement landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me be very clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The Eurosystem is ready to firmly commit to deliver T2S as a state-of-the-art settlement system to the market via the CSDs by 2013 at the latest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.71,0)">But it is also clear that the Eurosystem cannot do it alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">As substantial financial investments will need to be made for building T2S; we need the support and the commitment of the CSDs and their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">To conclude, I see T2S as Europe’s best route to a single securities settlement system, in which secure real time settlement in central bank money is provided across accounts held within a single platform, open to all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It will be operated by a neutral and trusted entity, the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Therefore, it can be relied on to operate in a transparent way and on a not for profit basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Let me also use this occasion, to express my warm “thank you” to all the stakeholders, the members of the national user groups, individuals and institutions who have worked together with the Eurosystem on the T2S project, for their openness and expertise and their contribution to the successful completion of work done so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">This is an example of how Europe can co-operate to harmonise and innovate in pursuit of the economic benefits of the single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Nearly 10 years ago, the euro was introduced and is now the common currency of more than 320 million Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The euro has been a great success in harmonising the exchange of cash across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Let us strive for a similar success in a harmonised security settlement market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">It’s now time to implement the monetary union that we began 10 years ago in the post trading sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">I am sure we can do so with your support and co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Thank you very much.</span>
