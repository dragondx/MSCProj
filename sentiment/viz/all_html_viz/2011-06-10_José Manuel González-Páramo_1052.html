    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.91,0)"> How will historians judge our handling of this crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, in the occasion of the presentation of the book titled “Un Siglo de Historia del Sistema Financiero Español”, Banco de EspañaMadrid, 10 June 2011 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity to speak today at the Bank of Spain about the Spanish financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The book being presented today consists of a distinguished collection of essays providing a wealth of information on Spain’s financial sector over the last century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Not only does it summarise the key data and the main developments, but it also provides deep analyses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It will definitely become the work of reference on the history of the financial sector in this country in the 20th century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Let me then congratulate the contributors and the editors, José Luis Malo de Molina and Pablo Martín Aceña for their excellent work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Reading the book, notably the chapter by Raimundo Poveda, we can draw some interesting parallels between the current crisis and the banking crisis in the late 1970s and early 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">In particular, given the current circumstances, the main message I would like to emphasise today is that certain changes in the banking sector that are implemented in response to crises are essential to guarantee a strong, robust banking sector in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In other words, the implementation of reforms and changes in the banking sector after a banking crisis – in respect of business practices, regulation and supervision – has the potential to strengthen the foundations of the banking sector, thereby improving its ability to contribute to sustainable economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Given the limited time that I have, I will focus on some key structural developments in the banking sector that have taken place over the past twenty years and that are described and analysed in several chapters of the book.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">In addition, I will examine how the regulations introduced by the Bank of Spain during the boom years helped to prevent and mitigate the negative effects of the crisis and, especially, how some of the reforms and structural changes that are currently being considered may substantially reduce the fragilities of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">If implemented, they will strengthen the banking system and ultimately have positive effects on financial stability and economic growth in Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Some reflections on banking developments during the last two decades As I see it, Spain’s banking sector has undergone two fundamental changes since 1990: banking liberalisation and financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Banking liberalisation has produced a notable increase in competition among institutions and in financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">For example, the cajas   have started to compete geographically and in different business segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The increased competition has also led, at different times during these 20 years, to strong competition for bank deposits  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In general, banking competition brings very positive aspects for the real economy and to welfare, and there is no doubt that liberalisation of the banking sector in Spain has been very positive for the country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.84,0)">However, we should bear in mind, as some chapters of the book point out, that too much competition may significantly increase bank risk-taking and that this may have negative implications and that this may undermine financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The recent very intense competition for retail deposits may also be a notable example in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Another important aspect of liberalisation has been the internationalisation of the banking sector, which is very well explained in the book.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">I would like to stress two aspects of this phenomenon: i) the foreign expansion by Spanish banks  , and ii) the significant dependence on foreign liquidity  , especially after the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Expansion abroad, when it is well executed, definitely brings benefits in terms of geographical diversification, which have become clear during the crisis, however a reliance on funding from abroad may bring some fragility if that source of liquidity dries up, as the crisis has shown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.7,0)">In previous banking crises, banks typically suffered from runs on retail deposits, whereas nowadays these runs are wholesale-based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">In the light of this, the sector should aim to diversify its sources of funding liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">The second defining element over the past decades has been the increase in financial innovation, notably in securitisation and market funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Securitisation can have many positive effects, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">by increasing the supply of bank credit to the private sector thanks to greater bank liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Some crucial segments of the economy, such as small and medium-sized firms, may also significantly benefit from the development of securitisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.37,0)">At the same time, recent research has shown that securitisation may lead to a lowering of banking standards and ultimately weaken financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.53,0)">Once a bank is no longer responsible for a loan that it has made, it has fewer incentives to monitor that loan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Besides, in periods of extensive securitisation, when the bank knows that new loans can be securitised – which in some countries can imply that the risk will be totally borne by investors outside the bank – the ex ante incentives for screening are notably reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">All these important changes in the banking industry have taken place against an ostensibly benign but potential dangerous macroeconomic backdrop: the so-called Great Moderation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Indeed, the protracted period of high economic growth and low short and long-term interest rates contributed to giving the banking sector some very good years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.43,0)">However, that is precisely when risk builds up – and it can be excessive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.83,0)">Moreover, we should not overlook that macro fragilities emerged during the benign macroeconomic context: for example, both the current account deficit and the share of the real estate sector activity were around 10% of GDP in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">All these elements contributed to a credit boom throughout the Spanish economy, particularly in the real estate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">In this context, let me add that – crucially – the Bank of Spain reacted very well: notably by introducing a strict regulatory system for special purpose vehicles which significantly restricted regulatory capital arbitrage, and by introducing dynamic provisions, which may have reduced the very high credit supply in the good years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.54,0)">Without those measures the credit boom could have been even bigger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Moreover, the provision buffers have been vital during the crisis as they have allowed banks to continue supporting credit availability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.11,0)">The crisis calls for change Some key features of the recent crisis have been, in my view, the fragility both on the liability and asset sides of banks, coupled with a densely interlinked global financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Banks’ capital reserves, transparency, funding, risk management, corporate governance and both micro and, especially, macro supervision and regulation need to be adjusted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me start with the fragile liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.67,0)">We have experienced since August 2007 a funding liquidity dry-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.91,0)">As I said before, in the run-up to the crisis, Spanish banks were highly dependent on foreign wholesale funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.59,0)">As a result, the sector as a whole ended up suffering and some of the more dependent banks have been hit very badly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.06,0)">But bank liquidity also depends crucially on bank capital and, hence, banks with stronger balance sheets suffer much less from a lack of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The liquidity provided by the Eurosystem has been vital to minimise the liquidity shortages, but bank capital needs to be stronger so that all banks have access to private funding liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Fragile assets were an important factor too, as very high volumes of credit   were granted during the good years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.48,0)">Some banks took more risk than others in the real estate bubble, and some banks recorded substantially lower profits and higher   loan losses during the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.38,0)">Hence, bank capital significantly decreased, especially for some groups of cajas; they, moreover, cannot easily raise capital because of their specific structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.54,0)">The availability of bank capital is essential for two additional reasons: First, a bank capital crunch may lead to a credit crunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Thus, in order to help the real economy recover, some weak banks need to be recapitalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is why the recent regulatory changes on capital in Spain are crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.14,0)">Banking assets are however opaque, which – combined with the high leverage – make recapitalisation in private markets difficult, especially in crisis periods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Therefore, to reduce these problems, high transparency is extremely important: the stress tests and Bank of Spain’s publications on key bank variables are thus indispensable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.37,0)">If, after these exercises to promote transparency, some small groups of banks cannot fulfil the capital requirements, restructuring may be the only solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Banks are still too highly exposed to real estate assets in their balance sheets and so the new haircuts introduced by the Bank of Spain go in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Geographical diversification   and better risk management are also crucial factors, I believe, in addressing the current challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">But also the strengthening of corporate governance is of utmost importance to avoid excessive risk-taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In other words, transparency and risk management are important, as I said, but incentives as well!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In this sense, the restructuring of some groups of banks may be vital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Second, looking into the future, with the crisis behind us, higher bank capital requirements will also play a positive role by reducing incentives for excessive bank risk-taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">On that same subject, we should welcome the changes made to EU and global banking regulations and supervision, both micro and macro-based: for example, the Basel III package of regulations   and the developments in macroprudential supervision with the establishment of the ESRB in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Concluding remarks Changes in the banking sector after the current crisis – at national, EU and global level – can make the Spanish banking sector stronger and provide a durable support for the real economy, as happened after the 1970-80 crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">To be specific, changes in the business models and the restructuring of some banks, more and higher-quality bank capital, better risk management, improved transparency and corporate governance, as well as changes in banking regulations and supervision – all these factors will contribute towards sustainable economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">However, as necessary as these changes are, they are not enough to bring about a strong and robust improvement in Spain’s economy, and particularly to create jobs and boost productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">To achieve these objectives, further progress must be made: in consolidating public finances, also to reduce the possible negative spillovers of the sovereign debt crisis to the banking sector; in liberalising product and factor markets, especially now the labour market with respect to “negociación colectiva”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">in improving the education system at all levels – it is critical to raising productivity over the medium term and, therefore, to improving welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">I truly hope that when another book like this one is written in, say 50 or 100 years’ time, the authors will conclude that the steps taken in response to the crisis in the banking and in other key sectors of the Spanish economy were the right ones and, in particular, that they played a part in overcoming the crisis and increasing in a sustainable way the well-being of the citizens of this country.</span>
