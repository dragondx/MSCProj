    <span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)"> Globalisation – a challenge for the euro area Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBInternational Conference on “Opportunities of the European Economy in Global Competition”Tallinn, 23 May 2007 Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure for me to be here today and share with you some thoughts on the challenges emerging from globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This conference has been organised to mark the 15th anniversary of the re-introduction of the Estonian kroon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Those 15 years have seen a radical break in international trade and capital flows for Estonia as well as a complete realignment of its position in the international economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The country’s track record over this period is truly impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Its per capita income moved up from around 30% of the EU-15 average in 1993 to around 60% in 2006 in purchasing power parity terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This growth has been greatly facilitated by the trade and foreign direct investment that have resulted from Estonia’s membership of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The volume of trade between Estonia and the euro area has more than doubled over the last eight years, and Estonia has, in fact, been one of the most successful new Member States in attracting FDI inflows in per capita terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Besides its catching-up, Estonia has also impressed me as one of the most open countries in Europe to new ideas, such as the introduction of an e-government or the use of e-payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The Baltic countries, and especially Estonia, have been moving fast in the area of e-payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">As you can see in the next chart, Estonia has not only managed to catch up with the euro area but has actually overtaken it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Estonia has been part of a two-fold process, namely, the deeper economic integration of Europe and the globalisation of the international economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">I will discuss this process today from a euro area perspective, as follows: first, I will consider the impact of globalisation on euro area trade; second, I will talk about EU enlargement as an important element of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Finally, I will assess the impact of globalisation on the growth and employment performance of the euro area and highlight a few areas of structural reforms where, in my view, progress is crucial if the euro area is to reap the full benefits of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Impact of globalisation on euro area trade Globalisation is a driving force in today’s world and the euro area has not been sheltered from it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">If we define globalisation as the increasing interdependence of economies via cross-border transactions in goods, services, natural resources, capital and labour, it appears that the process has greatly accelerated in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">One of its key aspects has been the increasing integration of emerging economies in Asia and in central and eastern Europe into world trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This development has sharply increased competition that greatly tested the adjustment capabilities of industrialised economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">How has the euro area adjusted to this increasingly competitive environment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.47,0)">According to a recent ECB study  , the losses in export market shares of the euro area since 1994 have been relatively small, and have mainly taken place in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.65,0)">In contrast, both the US and Japan have experienced larger losses in their market shares although recently both have stabilised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.82,0)">Most of these losses in trade shares were mainly the consequence of the steep increase in China’s share of the world market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">At the same time, many indicators suggest that the euro area has been a very active participant in globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Over the last decade, it has opened up significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Exports and imports in goods with trade partners outside the euro area increased to around 30% of GDP in 2005 from around 24% in 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This rise mainly reflected growing trade with Asia and the new EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Similarly, the euro area countries’ investment activity in third countries went up significantly, as part of the area’s adjustment to the global challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Between 1995 and 2005, extra euro-area FDI stocks increased from 21% to 34% of euro area GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In order to gain a deeper insight into the adjustment of the euro area compared with other regions, let us see what the relative export specialisations disclose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The next table compares the so-called revealed comparative advantages, using the method of the famous Hungarian economist Bela Balassa, dividing the export market share of a particular country with that of the world average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The chart considers four product groups based on factor intensities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">According to this measure, between 1993 and 2004, euro area exporters seem to have been specialising in capital- and research-intensive but also in labour-intensive products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The specialisation of the US and Japan appears to be somewhat different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">While the US has been concentrating on research-intensive products, Japan’s attention has been very much on both research- and capital-intensive products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">As expected, all emerging markets have been specialising in labour-intensive areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">In addition, other emerging Asia has increasingly been turning to research-intensive products, while central and eastern Europe has increased its specialisation in capital-intensive products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">These findings appear to be broadly in line with the factor intensities of the countries and regions in question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">However, the specialisation of the euro area in labour-intensive areas, which has not changed much since 1993, does not seem to be in line with its relatively high capital/labour ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.7,0)">Interestingly, over the same period, other emerging Asia has become less specialised in labour-intensive products than has the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What explains this relatively moderate adjustment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">While it may reflect stronger specialisation in higher-quality labour-intensive products, it may also reflect the impact of tighter product and labour market regulations than in the euro area’s main competitors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Although product market deregulation has progressed effectively since the early 1990s in the euro area, product market regulations are still tighter than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.72,0)">Higher regulatory burdens in the product market may have discouraged European firms to redirect their production to new areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.81,0)">In particular, higher entry and exit barriers may have led to higher adjustment costs, which in turn slowed down adjustment in industrial specialisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Similar to product market barriers, employment protection legislation also appears to be stricter in the euro area than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.95,0)">This may also explain the relatively slow change in industrial specialisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Benefits of EU enlargement When analysing the impacts of globalisation, we should not only focus on the implications of the emerging economic powers in Asia but also on the reintegration of the central and eastern European countries into the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The eastern enlargement of the EU was indeed a very important part of this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.09,0)">Enlargement has been clearly a win-win situation for both old and new EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Since the beginning of the transition process, a large volume of foreign direct investment has gone to the transition economies, partly in anticipation of future EU membership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Inward FDI stock in the eight countries in central and eastern European that joined the EU in 2004 grew to €211 billion in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">These investments have contributed to a huge technological upgrading of these countries and have fostered trade between the two previously separated halves of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Enlargement has provided new trade and investment opportunities in the EU and has given investors increased economic and legal certainty in the new EU members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">The trade flows between the euro area and the new EU Member States show just how important these countries have become.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The rise in the share of the 12 countries that have joined since 2004 has been quite striking in recent years, reaching around 10% of the total imports, and 13% of the total exports, of the euro area, well above that of the share of Japan, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">This sharp rise has largely reflected increases in intra-industry trade, which are a consequence of the relocation of some of the production processes of western European companies to central and eastern Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">This transfer has become an important part of their strategy to cope with an increasingly competitive environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">At the same time, it seems clear that the central and eastern European EU countries have also benefited significantly from a closer integration with the rest of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">All of them have enjoyed strong growth in recent years, with unemployment falling in most of these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Besides increasing trade flows, financial integration has been an important channel for these benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Over the last decade, all the new EU countries have opened up their financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The massive inflow of foreign capital and transfer of know-how, mainly through European banking groups, has significantly enhanced the efficiency of financial intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This, together with greater macroeconomic stability in the region, has contributed to a decrease in the cost of capital, supporting investment growth and ultimately economic growth and the catching-up process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Success in growth and employment creation in the euro area, but further structural reforms needed How did the euro area economy perform in terms of growth and employment over the last decade?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The available data suggest that the marked increase in trade and investment volumes contributed to GDP per capita growth, which stood at around 1.7% in the period between 1996 and 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Progress in employment creation was even more remarkable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Since 1995, the employment rate of the euro area increased by 6.6 percentage points, reaching 64.5% in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Increases in the female employment rate and the employment rate for older workers were even higher, at 9.6 and 8.7 percentage points respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.63,0)">Over the same period, unemployment in the euro area fell by 3.1 percentage points to 8.3% in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.15,0)">I find it especially interesting that, in spite of the increased competition from lower-cost producers, the unemployment rate of low-skilled workers declined the most in the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">This is a very positive development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.6,0)">In this context, I would like to refer to a growing concern in the industrialised nations about the impact of globalisation on their ability to sustain relatively high and evenly shared living standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">I can – to a certain extent – understand this concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">However, evidence suggests that the diverse developments in wage distributions across industrial countries   is driven more by country-specific events than by a common, global trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Domestic social and economic policies will continue to play a key role in a country’s internal cohesion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">And as adjustment costs can be significant, it is, in my view, important to sustain a wide consensus within society that globalisation and structural changes do benefit the country as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">In spite of recent successes, the full potential has, admittedly, not yet been achieved in reaping the benefits of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Against this background, it seems clear that the euro area also has to make further progress towards a knowledge-based economy and improve its ability to adjust to the challenges of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Clearly, one of the key issues is to increase the innovative capacity of the euro area by investing more in research and development, in order to increase the pace of productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In this regard, an increased level of product market competition would certainly be beneficial, as it would increase the incentives to win new market shares by offering new and more innovative products, thus creating a higher demand for R&D.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Against this background, the Lisbon agenda envisages that by 2010 EU countries spend on average 3% of their real GDP on R&D.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">So far, only Estonia’s neighbour Finland meets this target in the euro area; roughly 3.5% of its real GDP was spent on R&D in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.72,0)">In contrast, the euro average of real GDP spent on R&D in 2005 amounted to just 1.9%, significantly below that of the US or Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The main reason for the difference appears to be the much lower involvement by the business sector in R&D.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">To increase this investment, it is essential to foster private spending and not only to rely on public spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The key to success is thus to increase the share of expenditures on research and development related to GDP and to ensure the most efficient allocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Providing financial markets and, more generally, the business sector with the right incentives to get involved in R&D activities thus appears to be the key means of improving the innovation potential of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Closely related to innovation are investments in human capital and education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Here, the euro area can improve its innovation potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In this field, there have been substantial improvements in the euro area, in particular concerning the educational level of young people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">As the next slide shows, a significantly higher share of the 25 to 34-year-olds attained at least upper secondary education than did the 35 to 44-year-olds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Beyond the numerical aspects I would also say that education was one of the many areas where close cooperation between European countries shows its benefits, as more and more young people realise the benefits of studying abroad in Europe, learn about other cultures and recognise diversity as a strength.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Looking ahead, educational policies focusing on life-long learning appears to be especially important in facilitating a smoother re-allocation of workers between sectors and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Given the still high regulatory burden in the euro area, creating a business-friendly environment with low administrative and bureaucratic costs for firms and business start- ups appears to be of paramount importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The statistics indicate much room for improvement in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">As a recent World Bank study   shows, in 2006, the average cost of starting a business with up to 50 employees in the euro area amounted to roughly USD 2,226, compared with USD 285 in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">In 2006, it took on average 22 days to set up a business in the euro area, compared with 5 days in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">It is encouraging that since the late 1990s barriers to entrepreneurship appear to have decreased in almost all euro area countries, although they still remain relatively high in most euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.83,0)">Furthermore, adjustments to the level of employment protection should be a priority, in particular where they impede the hiring of younger workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.65,0)">While Europe is facing a demographic challenge, with an increasing shortage of young workers, it is striking that youth unemployment is still fairly high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In this regard, over the last decade, the euro area countries deserve some credit for progress, particularly in making temporary employment contracts more flexible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.24,0)">As suggested by the OECD indicator on employment protection legislation, the laws covering temporary contracts have become much less strict.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">As a result, for example, the share of young people working on temporary contracts rose to 50.3% in 2006, compared with 41% in 1996.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.63,0)">However, the level of employment protection legislation for permanent contracts has only fallen slightly since 1990.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.0,0)">It is therefore important to reform legislation on permanent contracts if it discourages employers from hiring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">In addition, in order to fully exploit the euro area countries’ changing comparative advantages in producing goods and services it is essential that labour markets adjust quickly to changing demand conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">This requires the right incentives for the sufficient mobility of workers, inter alia, between jobs and regions, but also from unemployment to employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Suitable adjustment mechanisms in the euro area also require sufficient labour mobility across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.56,0)">The low level of cross-border labour mobility within the EU has to be seen in the context of cultural diversity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.85,0)">However, it also reflects the existence of legal and administrative barriers, moving costs, inefficient housing markets, the limited portability of pension rights and problems with the international recognition of professional qualifications  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Finally, let me emphasise that wage differentiation is essential for improving employment opportunities for less skilled persons and in regions with high unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Generally, wage developments need to adequately reflect developments in productivity by skill level, region and industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.03,0)">Conclusion and policy implications In conclusion, the euro area is facing an increasingly challenging competitive environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">While so far the euro area as a whole appears to have defended relatively well its market share in world trade, and has been a very active participant in world trade and foreign direct investment flows, it has adjusted its production and trade structure more slowly than have its main competitors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">At the same time, the stable economic growth and increasing employment rates in both old and new Member States in recent years suggest that so far Europe has proved to be a successful model for creating growth and employment opportunities through establishing a large internal market for capital, goods, services and employment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.74,0)">Looking ahead, in the face of globalisation, protectionism and the shielding of jobs and industries from international competition are not an option.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">As I have argued in my presentation, we are certainly not witnessing a “fortress euro area”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">In order to reap the full benefits of globalisation, the EU must make further efforts towards a knowledge- based economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">In this context, promoting R&D, adopting new technologies as well as upgrading workers’ skills are crucial policy steps towards achieving the Lisbon target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">At the same time, lowering product market regulation unlocks productivity potential and innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Improving the flexibility of labour markets in the euro area seems to be equally important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">In particular, labour market policies that combine flexibility with increased employment opportunities appear to be crucial to facilitate structural adjustment, permitting a smooth move away from declining and towards expanding activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">As regards Estonia, I am confident that this small and creative country will continue its successful catching-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As I already mentioned, it has experienced an impressive increase in income levels – a trend that is likely to continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.55,0)">However, we should not overlook the fact that Estonia, despite her successful reintegration into the world economy currently faces significant challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The country in particular needs to keep its macroeconomic imbalances   under control in order to ensure sustainable convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">I wish Estonia the best of luck in tackling these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.58,0)">In Estonian, I think you would say: Jóudu ja edu ka edaspidiseks!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">U.
