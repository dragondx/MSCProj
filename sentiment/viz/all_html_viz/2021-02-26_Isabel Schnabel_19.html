    <h3> Speaker: Isabel Schnabel </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.56,0)"> Unconventional fiscal and monetary policy at the zero lower bound Keynote speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Third Annual Conference organised by the European Fiscal Board on “High Debt, Low Rates and Tail Events: Rules-Based Fiscal Frameworks under Stress” Frankfurt am Main, 26 February 2021 One of the greatest conundrums and policy challenges of our times is the coincidence of persistently low real long-term interest rates and low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.29,0)">Even before the coronavirus   pandemic, inflation across many advanced economies had been falling short of central banks’ aims for nearly a decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.93,0)">In the euro area, hopes that inflation would sustainably recover to levels closer to 2% have been repeatedly and persistently disappointed, despite highly favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.66,0)">Years of subdued price pressures have raised the spectre of low inflation becoming entrenched in people’s expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.6,0)">Considering that financial markets believe that real interest rates will remain in negative territory for the foreseeable future, private investors appear to harbour serious doubts about the capacity of the euro area economy to chart a sustainable path towards higher nominal growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In my remarks this morning, I will argue that the experience of the past decade requires us to think differently about the optimal policy mix in the vicinity of the effective lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In particular, whether low inflation will prevail in the medium term will depend not only on monetary policy but also on the decisions made by fiscal policymakers, including on the structural side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Monetary policy implications of persistent supply-side shocks Before the pandemic, the global economy enjoyed a period of benevolent growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.22,0)">Slack was gradually disappearing, output gaps had closed and unemployment had declined to record low levels in many advanced economies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.55,0)">Even broader measures of slack, including, for example, the number of people working part-time involuntarily, signalled growing scarcity in labour markets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Yet, inflation in advanced economies did not show any signs of acceleration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Since 2012, there has not been a single year in which inflation for a group of advanced economies as a whole exceeded 2% – the level that is widely considered to be consistent with price stability  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.13,0)">At first sight, these developments seem to point to a weakened relationship between economic slack and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.28,0)">ECB staff analysis for the euro area, however, suggests that while the slope of the Phillips curve is flat, it has not changed in any statistically significant manner in recent years  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.48,0)">Instead, Phillips curve models point to other factors putting persistent downward pressure on underlying inflation in recent years  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.39,0)">Research suggests that these factors include slow-moving secular forces, such as demographic change, the decline in productivity growth, the impact of globalisation and digitalisation on prices, profits and the bargaining power of workers, as well as far-reaching changes in energy production and consumption, also due to climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The coincidence of low inflation with a persistent decline in real interest rates corroborates the view that structural factors are likely to have played an important role in recent years  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.55,0)">With more savings chasing fewer investments, low and stable inflation today is consistent with real short and long-term interest rates that are much lower than even a decade ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.32,0)">Available estimates of this “equilibrium” rate of interest suggest that nowadays stable inflation is likely to require a negative real short-term interest rate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The implications of these developments for monetary policy are twofold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.13,0)">First, since monetary policy is acting on the demand side, it has less traction in countering persistent structural shocks to inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.0,0)">In the absence of supply-side policies, inflation can then diverge from central banks’ aim for a protracted period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.08,0)">Adaptive expectations raise the costs of such divergences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.78,0)">If firms and households expect inflation to remain at very low levels, it becomes even harder for central banks to achieve their inflation aim  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.47,0)">Second, the decline in real interest rates limits the extent to which monetary policy can stabilise the economy in the wake of demand-side shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.6,0)">The pandemic is a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.8,0)">Despite the unprecedented severity of the crisis and the large shortfall in aggregate demand, the ECB did not cut its key policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Although there is some room left to reduce short-term rates further, the benefits and costs of deeper negative rates need to be weighed carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.84,0)">To circumvent the effective lower bound, central banks have resorted to unconventional monetary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">For example, in response to the pandemic, the ECB launched a new asset purchase programme – the pandemic emergency purchase programme   – and a new series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Such tools are powerful in directly influencing the relevant borrowing conditions of the private sector, and they have been instrumental in stimulating growth and inflation during the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But after many years of continued monetary expansion, the risk-free yield curve in the euro area has become very flat – much flatter than in the United States  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.83,0)">As a result, there is less scope for asset purchases to further compress term premia and thus long-term yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.35,0)">Moreover, academics and the central banking community increasingly acknowledge that, even if real rates could be pushed lower, the effects on growth and inflation may be limited as aggregate demand may become less sensitive to interest rate changes when rates are very low, or when they have been low for a long time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.37,0)">The result could be a “macroeconomic reversal rate”, at which the costs of further easing, especially in terms of financial stability, could outgrow the benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.08,0)">The euro area policy mix before and during the pandemic The implication is that, in a world in which monetary policy is constrained and in which inflation is not solely determined by demand-side policies over a policy-relevant horizon, it will be difficult for monetary policy alone to stabilise the economy satisfactorily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">A key lesson from the literature is that, in these circumstances, monetary, fiscal and structural policies are needed to jump-start and reflate the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The failure of inflation to accelerate more forcefully in the euro area over the past decade may, in fact, be less of a conundrum when considering the response of public spending to even sizeable changes in interest rates: before the pandemic hit the euro area, the primary balance was positive and growing in the years after 2014  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.32,0)">Public investment fell rather than rose  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.11,0)">The lack of public investment might also have hampered private investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For the euro area, there is evidence that public investment tends to crowd in private investment, rather than out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.96,0)">A public sector that is largely insensitive to interest rate changes significantly reduces the effectiveness of monetary policy, in particular in the euro area, where governments account for nearly half of total spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.19,0)">An unresponsive fiscal authority disregards the broad empirical evidence that fiscal policy is particularly effective at the lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.73,0)">Fiscal restraint was, of course, not without reason.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.41,0)">In many countries, years of cyclical upswing before the global financial crisis had not been used to build sufficient fiscal buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.06,0)">Elevated debt levels carry a particularly high vulnerability in a decentralised currency union, where the absence of a fully consolidated public balance sheet exposes governments to a higher risk of self-fulfilling debt crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.93,0)">Fiscal policy, then, faces a difficult trade-off between business cycle stabilisation and debt sustainability, in particular in a situation with high legacy debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This limits the extent to which governments can commit to sizeable expansionary fiscal policies, even if such policies would be optimal for society as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.61,0)">The pandemic has been a stark reminder of this trade-off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.91,0)">Risk premia on lower-rated sovereign bonds sky-rocketed in March last year, impairing the transmission of both monetary and fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Two decisions were necessary to break this vicious circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">First, the launch of the PEPP concentrated market expectations around the good equilibrium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.65,0)">Sovereign spreads in Greece, for example, had fallen by 150 basis points before we even bought a single bond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The backstop function of the PEPP prevented private cross-border risk-sharing from collapsing more permanently, as it had done in past crises, thereby complementing efforts to increase public risk sharing  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Second, the European Commission lifted state aid requirements and decided to invoke the escape clause, and the launch of the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility pooled risks, thereby reducing pressure on national budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">For the first time, a euro area-wide instrument was created with the specific aim of ensuring that the aggregate euro area fiscal stance is appropriately countercyclical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Together, the PEPP and the Recovery and Resilience Facility created the conditions for national fiscal policies to mitigate the dramatic social and economic costs of this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The experience of the past year suggests that, in the presence of both facilities, all national government bonds are, in essence, considered safe assets by private investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.11,0)">Indeed, never since the global financial crisis of 2008 has the spread between the GDP-weighted 10-year sovereign yield and the euro area risk-free rate been lower than today, despite the sharp rise in nominal debt and deficits  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The policy response to the pandemic is a remarkable showcase for the power of monetary and fiscal policy interaction to boost confidence, stabilise aggregate demand and avoid a persistent destabilisation of medium to long-term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.85,0)">Macroeconomic stabilisation in the future Both facilities, however, are temporary and linked to the pandemic, while the effective lower bound is likely to remain a recurring constraint in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.9,0)">ECB staff simulations suggest that, at current levels of the real equilibrium interest rate, the lower bound may become binding one-quarter of the time – about twice as often as estimated when the euro was introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The question, then, is how to ensure effective macroeconomic stabilisation in the euro area in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The pandemic holds two lessons, one for monetary and one for fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">First, monetary policy has to enable sustainable private and public spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.4,0)">Low rates do not mean that monetary policy no longer has a role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">On the contrary, monetary support will remain an important pillar of macroeconomic stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But, in the vicinity of the lower bound, the central bank needs to weigh more carefully the evolving balance of the benefits and costs of lowering short- and long-term rates further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">In this environment, when financing conditions are at a level that incentivises all sectors of the economy to consume and invest, monetary policy can best support the economy by shifting its focus away from instrument activism – that is, from the intensity with which it uses the available array of instruments – and towards the duration of policy support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">By credibly promising to preserve favourable financing conditions for as long as needed central banks underscore their unwavering commitment to the achievement of their mandate and ensure that monetary policy does not itself become a source of uncertainty, both with respect to its short-term reaction function and the potential vulnerabilities that too negative yield curve constellations could create in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The horizon of policy support will then depend on the extent to which the private and the public sector make use of accommodative monetary conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The intensity of policy support, in turn, will evolve endogenously with the economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This means that changes in nominal rates have to be monitored closely and interpreted in the light of their driving forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">For example, a rise in nominal yields that reflects an increase in inflation expectations is a welcome sign that the policy measures are bearing fruit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Even gradual increases in real yields may not necessarily be a cause of concern if they reflect improving growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.58,0)">However, a rise in real long-term rates at the early stages of the recovery, even if reflecting improved growth prospects, may withdraw vital policy support too early and too abruptly given the still fragile state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Policy will then have to step up its level of support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">A policy of preserving favourable financing conditions includes a second element.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">To ultimately empower fiscal policy as a transmission channel of monetary policy, the ECB needs to provide liquidity when risks of self-fulfilling price spirals threaten to undermine stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As was the case during the pandemic, this may require temporary flexibility in the use of instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Being clear about this upfront reduces the emergence of destabilising dynamics in the first place and minimises the extent of interventions when they are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.18,0)">In such situations, risks of moral hazard should not condemn the central bank to a course of inaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">These risks should be governed by other institutions outside crisis times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The lesson for fiscal policy is that, in lower bound episodes, it has to become more responsive to downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">This requires fiscal tools that are specifically designed to provide macroeconomic stabilisation, ideally at the euro area level, but at least at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Put simply, unconventional monetary policy needs to be complemented by unconventional fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.37,0)">The concept of unconventional fiscal policy is not yet well established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.22,0)">A simple Google search, for example, returns more than 700,000 results for unconventional monetary policy but only about 8,000 entries for unconventional fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In essence, unconventional fiscal policy comprises measures that go beyond traditional automatic stabilisers, which tend to be too small to offset the effects of an adverse demand shock at the lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.33,0)">These unconventional measures are only activated when the economy heads into a deep recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.57,0)">In the United States, for example, the length of unemployment benefits automatically increases as soon as the unemployment rate exceeds a certain threshold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">The use of job furlough schemes in large parts of the euro area in response to the pandemic is another powerful example of how unconventional fiscal policies can stabilise household incomes to avoid risks of long-term scarring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Similarly, theoretical and empirical evidence suggests that budget-neutral policies that work through the revenue side – for example, by engineering a specific path for consumption and labour taxes over time – can effectively support the efforts by central banks to boost inflation expectations and consumer spending at the lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Creating a framework for effective stabilisation in the euro area Refocusing stabilisation along these lines requires an institutional framework that reliably creates space for fiscal policy in good times and allows this space to be used in bad times to provide a policy mix that best protects the euro area economy against downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.33,0)">In 2019, the European Fiscal Board concluded that the current framework remained insufficient to deliver a more countercyclical fiscal policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It also recommended focusing on a single operational indicator – an expenditure rule – and a single target, a debt anchor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">There is broad agreement that these proposals go in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Because most expenditure components are insensitive to business cycle variations, an expenditure rule can measurably help reduce the procyclicality of fiscal policy and thereby also support monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.11,0)">An intense debate has emerged, however, about the appropriate level of the debt anchor, and the EU’s 60% reference value in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.8,0)">Not few observers point to the benign implications of the sharp decline in real and nominal interest rates for debt sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.62,0)">Despite much higher debt, interest rate expenses as a share of euro area GDP have declined from more than 5% in 1995 to 1.6% today  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Rates can, of course, rise again in the future if required by the price stability mandate of the central bank even if depressed equilibrium interest rates will make monetary policy restrictive at much lower interest rate levels than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.74,0)">History suggests, however, that it would be a mistake to project the present environment into the indefinite future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.25,0)">Interest rate growth differentials have fluctuated widely in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.11,0)">Periods with negative “r-g” have often been followed by periods with positive “r-g”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.11,0)">It would be imprudent to assume that governments face no intertemporal budget constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">A credible debt anchor remains an important pillar of a stability-oriented policy framework and central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Yet, there is a case for reflecting on the appropriate pace at which this debt anchor should be reached over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Two considerations are most relevant for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.79,0)">First, ECB staff analysis suggests that, under the current rules, requirements to reduce debt in excess of the 60% threshold risk creating a vicious circle between monetary and fiscal policy when inflation is below our medium-term aim – which is precisely at a time when fiscal support is most needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Correcting fiscal adjustment requirements for deviations from the ECB’s inflation aim would help break this circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Simulation analysis suggests that such a “nominal” cyclical adjustment would significantly smooth adjustment requirements  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">It would create fiscal space and support price stability without endangering debt sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Second, the medium-term pace of adjustment should strike a sensible balance between the benign effects of the decline of real equilibrium interest rates on debt sustainability and the importance of a credible debt anchor for market expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.95,0)">Take the pandemic as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.38,0)">A mechanical application of the current rules could imply fiscal adjustment needs in some euro area economies that would be severely damaging from a societal, economic and monetary policy perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.08,0)">Evidence shows that austerity does not pay off at times of weak growth, even if debt is already high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Targeted fiscal support will improve rather than harm future debt dynamics by reducing the scars that the pandemic will leave.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.23,0)">There is one further reason why a too mechanistic return to lower debt levels may be misguided: expenditure cuts often affect investment the most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.75,0)">Reducing public investment further from already low levels would be a costly mistake.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">New research shows that many investments, in particular in education and infrastructure, pay for themselves at much higher real interest rates than the ones currently prevailing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The responsible use of the Recovery and Resilience Facility is crucial in that respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">It provides sizeable funds to promote investment in future technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.52,0)">But EU funds should not be taken as an excuse to reduce the investment component of national budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Public investment and structural policies hold the key to a higher sustainable growth path and higher interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.13,0)">Monetary policy must take the equilibrium interest rate largely as given.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Fiscal policy can help raise it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Conclusion My conclusion is therefore that the current era of low inflation and low interest rates – which is unlikely to change in the near term in light of the pandemic – forces us to reconsider how monetary and fiscal policy should complement each other to protect the economy from large downturns and to minimise risks of long-term scarring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Effective macroeconomic stabilisation in the vicinity of the lower bound requires both unconventional monetary and fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Central banks need to establish and preserve a level of financing conditions that enables sustainable private and public spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Fiscal policy, in turn, needs to recognise its role in the transmission of monetary policy in a low inflation, low interest rate environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Achieving this policy mix requires an institutional framework that creates the tools and the space for fiscal policy to support the efforts of the central bank when inflation is below its aim and that recognises the existence of a budget constraint in the long run.</span>
