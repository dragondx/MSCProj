    <span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)"> Central banks and financial stability Remarks by T. Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK, Jakarta, 7 July 2003 It is a great pleasure for me to be here today at the invitation of the Central Bank of Indonesia and to have the opportunity to share with you my views on the importance of financial stability and, in particular, the role central banks play in achieving it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.53,0)">The financial crisis in South-East Asia in the late 1990s provided a very stark demonstration of the destructive effects of financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In Indonesia alone, estimates of the fiscal costs of re-capitalising the banking system are put at over 25% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And to this we need to add the opportunity costs of lost output, investment and employment, as well as the social costs associated with instability, to even come close to a full welfare analysis of the crisis  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.02,0)">Central banks   have been acutely aware of the problems of financial instability for many years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Indeed, one of the historical reasons for setting up a central bank was to have an institution that could act as lender-of- last-resort so as to prevent widespread disruption of the financial system, a topic I will return to later on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.85,0)">But, arguably, despite its long history, the conceptual framework underlying the analysis of financial stability was, until relatively recently, largely underdeveloped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In this sense the Asian crisis acted as a very serious wake-up call, to policy-makers in developed and developing countries alike, of the need to understand better the precise ways in which financial crises, and instability more generally, come about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Six years on, I think we have made progress in setting out the conceptual road map for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The contours of the "land" have not been fully explored and there are no doubt obstacles to be faced en route.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Nonetheless, I think we are now better placed to understand the genesis and propagation of financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">I would like to concentrate today on two areas where our thinking has developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, how the objective of financial stability fits with the other objectives of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Second, the range of tools at the disposal of central banks to combat financial instability and prevent systemic crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Central bank objectives The two main objectives of central banks around the world relate to the maintenance of monetary and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">While monetary stability simply means price stability, no such straightforward definition exists for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.65,0)">Defining financial stability is notoriously difficult, and that is why people find it more convenient to define financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.1,0)">While verifying that an economy faces financial instability is generally obvious, it is not so easy to tell when threats of such instability might be approaching.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In order to monitor these threats, one needs to have a clear idea of what are the elements contributing to financial stability and when these could be at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For this purpose, an explicit definition of financial stability - rather than a definition of its negative counterpart - can be useful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In addition, a concrete definition of financial stability is important for the direct links between financial stability and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">At the European Central Bank  , we consider financial stability as "a condition whereby the financial system is able to withstand shocks without giving way to cumulative processes, which impair the allocation of savings to investment opportunities and the processing of payments in the economy".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We do not define financial stability as explicitly referring to banking stability only, but it does not contradict the argument that banks play a crucial role in the soundness of the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">This may be especially true in developing countries, where banks typically have a dominant position in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Having touched on the issue of definitions, let me now turn to a possible tradeÂ­ off between the two concepts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">We probably all agree that monetary policy and financial stability are intimately linked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">There is little doubt that price stability supports sound investment and sustainable growth, which in turn is conducive to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Since the fragility of banks and their counterparties tends to be heightened when prices are unstable, the pursuit of price stability can be seen as a crucial contribution to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Similarly, attaining financial stability should also contribute to monetary stability in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.75,0)">However, while both inflation and deflation are detrimental to financial stability, price stability is certainly not a sufficient condition for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It is a fact that significant episodes of financial crises - or situations that could have led to crises - took place in the last two or three decades in a context of overall price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.03,0)">The Japanese banking problems of the early 1990s are perhaps the most famous illustration of this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Thus, achieving stable prices does not mean that central banks can ignore financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.13,0)">An important question is: could there be circumstances in which the monetary policy stance required to maintain price stability could harm the stability of the financial system?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Theoretically, such situations do have fairly robust underpinnings, although empirically these occasions appear to be quite rare - mainly a result of the strong link between recessions and financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.9,0)">But such situations can arise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">If for example, the central bank assigns a relatively high probability to financial instability and assesses that such instability is associated with deflationary tendencies, it may need to accept higher inflation in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In my opinion, as long as the central bank employs a medium-term horizon for the definition of price stability and adopts a forward-looking approach, financial imbalances will necessarily be taken into account, and there need not be any conflict of objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Undoubtedly, this is a very information-intensive exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">But through this process, central banks can and should include financial stability considerations in monetary policy-making aimed at maintaining long-term price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Tools for promoting financial stability As regards the instruments available for maintaining financial stability, the range of policies rather depends on the exact responsibilities of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.05,0)">In particular, some central banks, such as Bank Indonesia , are also banking supervisors, whereas others, such as the ECB, operate without prudential regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But even without supervisory powers, I would maintain that central banks have a number of "tools" in their financial stability toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First, if public authorities are to play a successful role in safeguarding financial stability, threats to financial stability must be effectively monitored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.04,0)">Identifying vulnerabilities in the financial and non-financial sectors and potential shocks in these markets is a vitally important part of a central bank's work  ; commentators sometimes refer to this as macro-prudential analysis/surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.38,0)">A key lesson from the South-East Asian crisis is the need for policy-makers to be alert to the development of significant financial imbalances in the economy, which can quickly unwind, causing widespread disruption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This is true for both developing and developed economies, as attested by the recent worries about how the financial imbalances in the United States may unravel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Second, the tools primarily intended for maintaining price stability, interest rates and market operations, can at times be used to promote financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">As I noted earlier, in the long run financial and monetary stability should mutually reinforce each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.76,0)">But, in the short run, easing monetary conditions may be an entirely appropriate response by central banks concerned about financial fragility spilling over into system-wide problems, which in turn could disturb monetary stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The LTCM example, when the Federal Reserve System eased monetary conditions to increase liquidity in the financial markets, is a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Third, when it is an option, micro-prudential regulation and supervision and deposit insurance are important elements of maintaining system-wide stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">That is, by ensuring that individual institutions are financially sound, supervisors can help to maintain the stability of the system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As regards their specific instruments - capital charges, provisioning policies and risk limits, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">- supervisory authorities still feel much more comfortable with the micro- prudential perspective  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.46,0)">Whether or not such tools should pay attention to limiting financial and economic cycles is currently an important policy question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">A strong counter-argument, which is made by many supervisory authorities, is that the efforts already made, and continuing to be made, to upgrade prudential safeguards will be sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">While progress in this respect has certainly been very significant and impressive, it remains the case that potential credit and asset price cycles and increased exposure of banks to financial market fluctuations might leave scope for more forward-looking supervisory measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Such measures would strengthen defences during good times by establishing reserves to be drawn upon during bad times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The implementation of such policies is still fraught with problems  , but I think they deserve further consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Fourth, emergency liquidity assistance  , perhaps the most traditional tool available to a central bank for dealing with financial instability, is possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It includes both the provision of liquidity to the financial system as a whole through market operations, as well as emergency lending to individual banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.82,0)">It is important to recognise that not all liquidity injections aimed at preventing the spread of a liquidity problem relate to a crisis, as central banks routinely offer liquidity against specified collateral requirements in order to support the orderly functioning of markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Because of the obvious dangers of moral hazard, central banks have maintained an increasingly cautious stance towards emergency lending by adopting a policy of case-by-case discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.7,0)">They decline to specify in advance which financial institutions would be granted emergency liquidity and under which conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.84,0)">Gerry Corrigan has dubbed this "constructive ambiguity".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In theory, we all agree that emergency liquidity support should be provided only to illiquid but solvent institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.69,0)">But the distinction between these two concepts is particularly difficult to make in periods of financial distress, which is exactly when central banks may have to use this tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Consequently, careful judgement is necessary in providing emergency liquidity assistance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The Asian crisis provides a clear example of this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.25,0)">Central banks in the region had to make difficult choices between providing support to individual institutions and encouraging moral hazard, and limiting the fall-out of failing institutions for the wider economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.07,0)">All central banks could potentially face this dilemma.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Fifth, central banks are often involved in payment systems either directly or in an oversight capacity, and can exercise influence here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.6,0)">The potential risks related to a disruption of the payment circuit - due to either a failing participant or an operational breakdown - are extremely serious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.53,0)">In addition, credit positions across banks in netting systems can constitute a source of contagion risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Central banks have often been involved in developing mechanisms to limit the potential increase of these various risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Specifically, in the field of large-value payments they have promoted enhanced safety arrangements in net settlement systems, supported the introduction of real-time gross settlement systems, and developed the payment and settlement system oversight function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">As operators of payment systems, central banks often have the unique expertise to identify potential risks and to handle stability problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">In this respect, more efforts seem to be warranted to better use the data from payment systems to identify liquidity risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Finally, communication through the public comments of public authorities can be a powerful additional tool to influence market behaviour in a manner which can be conducive to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">In particular, it may act as a way to overcome coÂ­ordination failures in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Central banks' private communication has proven to be an important tool in co-ordinating private sector solutions without the injection of public funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Such interventions could be beneficial, even if authorities' information is no better than that of private market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.17,0)">Authorities' information might be credible simply because they do not have a profit motive and comment on financial developments more infrequently than private market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.66,0)">Naturally, communication could be counterproductive if information is issued at an inopportune moment or if the information later turns out to have been wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Hence, the use of such "open-mouth operations" should be reviewed carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In a nutshell, I would summarise the main tools at the disposal of public authorities to pursue financial stability in the following way: Tools for maintaining price and financial stability Tool Price stability Financial stability System-wide Individual institutions Monetary policy strategy XX X Short-term interest rates XX X Market operations XX X Payment systems XX Public and private comments XX ï¿½ ï¿½ Emergency liquidity support XX XX Crisis co-ordination ï¿½ ï¿½ï¿½ Prudential regulation O OO Prudential supervision O O O 10.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Deposit insurance O OO Legend: two symbols   = primary use of the tool; one symbol   = additional use of the tool; Ã = tool of a central bank without supervisory powers; O = tool in the hands of an authority other than the central bank; Â® tool available to both.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.14,0)">Concluding remarks The financial crisis in South-East Asia in the late 1990s was a devastating experience for the region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Policy-makers the world over have hopefully learned lessons from the episode to try and ensure, as far as possible, that such crises are not repeated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.44,0)">Though the initial causes of the instability and the exact propagation mechanisms may have been peculiar to the region, it raised a number of issues generic to central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In particular, it demonstrated that financial stability is an important goal in its own right and that central banks, even those without supervisory powers, need to give it due weight in their policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The conceptual framework for financial stability analysis, unlike that of monetary stability, is still being developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Further work in this area is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">But being clear about central bank objectives, any possible   conflicts and the range of instruments at their disposal moves us in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Hopefully, I have shown that progress is being made on this front.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I would now be very happy to discuss further any of the issues I have raised, or other financial stability topics relevant for the Bank Indonesia that I did not focus on in my remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">BIS Review 40/1999: Presentation by the Governor of Bank Indonesia, Dr. Syrahil Sabirin, at the Indonesian Executive Circle Forum in Jakarta on 7 April 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.45,0)">Quantifying the cost of financial crises is very difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.7,0)">Welfare losses to the economy associated with a banking crisis are often proxied by losses in GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.18,0)">By this measure, for the five economies most seriously affected by the South-East Asian crisis, the fall in GDP below trend is estimated at around 15%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.05,0)">Technically, monitoring in itself is not a policy tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It is rather a prerequisite for the effective use of policies available for maintaining financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">As in the monetary policy field, we need strong monitoring to support good policy-making.</span>
