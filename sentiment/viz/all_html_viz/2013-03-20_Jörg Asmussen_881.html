    <span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)"> Is Europe on the right track?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Speech by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at Deutsche Bank Women in European Business conference“Competition versus Coalition – the quest for growth?”, Frankfurt am Main, 20 March 2013 Dear Ms. Siebert, Dear Mr. Leithner, Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much for inviting me to speak at the Women in European Business Conference organised by Deutsche Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The topic of this year’s conference – the quest for growth – could scarcely be more relevant for Europe today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.72,0)">As this audience knows better than most, the low growth environment is posing serious challenges for businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.61,0)">Uncertainty about the future is a drag on confidence and a barrier to new investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.25,0)">It causes banks to cut back on lending, especially to small- and medium-sized firms, which are critical to help growth rebound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.02,0)">And above all, low growth is deeply affecting the lives of ordinary people in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.69,0)">As a result, many are frustrated, and some are even desperate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.09,0)">They doubt whether the European strategy to deal with the crisis is the right one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">They are asking: “Will we ever come out of it, with ever more cuts and austerity?” And it is right and legitimate that they are asking this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">“Power of the masses” is a key theme of this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We are democratic societies in Europe and these important choices about the future of our countries and our monetary union require a proper public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But this debate also needs to be based on substance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.24,0)">Rage alone does not solve our problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.99,0)">Just being angry at politicians or officials, even if justified, does not help citizens understand the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">People need to be presented with the real choices facing them – even if that means taking hard decisions or making sacrifices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.12,0)">Offering allegedly easy solutions, or presenting false alternatives, abandons the debate to populists and gambles with the long-term prosperity of our societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">So today I would like to present my view on the choices that are facing Europe – and in doing so, to expose some of the myths and misconceptions about the European approach to managing the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Concretely, I want to answer two questions: First, are there alternatives to the current strategy, and if so, what are their real consequences?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Second, are we condemned to a “lost decade”, or can we find new sources of growth to lift us out of the crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.49,0)">The reality of the alternatives Policy-makers sometimes speak about certain courses of action as being without alternatives – “alternativlos” as we say in German.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.88,0)">Of course, this is not true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.2,0)">There always are alternatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The question is whether they are superior, especially when assessing their likely impact and longer-term consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">So let me begin by looking at those alternatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">As you know, one pillar of the crisis response in Europe has been to consolidate government budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Progress has so far been good: the European Commission estimates that, by the end of this year, the euro area as a whole will have a budget deficit below 3% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.22,0)">But this progress has also had costs in the short term: growth has turned out to be lower than forecast and unemployment has risen steeply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.22,0)">Almost 19 million people in the euro area are currently without jobs – this includes almost one in every four young people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.1,0)">In the face of this hardship, the strategy of reducing deficits has come under increasing criticism from commentators and politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.35,0)">Some now urge an “exit from the austerity cage”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.64,0)">Others claim that, by continuing to cut deficits when growth is so low, policy-makers are ignoring the evidence, even being ideological.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">To exit the crisis, they say, Europe must engage in an urgent change of course: more time, less austerity; more public money, less reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.41,0)">Let me be clear: I am also very concerned by the high level of unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">I would also like to see stronger growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But before proposing to change course, we need to think through the consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is what responsible policymaking means.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">And put simply, the consequence of stopping cutting deficits is to increase public debts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Is this a feasible or sustainable solution to our problems?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.92,0)">The real consequences of changing course In my view, the answer is ‘no’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">First, regardless of its merits, such a strategy would only work if private investors were willing to finance higher borrowing at reasonable rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">And that is certainly a big “if”, especially for countries whose debts are already very high and rising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.63,0)">Second, it is an illusion to think that more debt is the answer to this debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.83,0)">Recent research has shown that high public debt levels in the euro area hamper growth, with a serious negative effect starting when debt exceeds 90% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.08,0)">Average euro area public debt is already above that level – almost 95% of GDP –so adding more debt will only put us further into the danger zone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.14,0)">Third, a strategy of increasing debt simply pushes problems in to the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Any benefits for the current generation come at the expense of future generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Higher borrowing today means higher interest payments tomorrow – which have to be paid off with the taxes of tomorrow’s citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.07,0)">Moreover, the more today’s generation consumes, the more future generations will have to save to get the debt level back down again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And they will have to do this: as part of the new EU debt rule, all euro area countries are legally bound to start reducing their public debts below 60% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">To give a sense of what this means, take the example of Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Public debt is almost 130% of GDP, so it will have to be more than halved by the next generation to abide by the debt limit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Around 80 billion euros a year goes on debt service – this is more than 10% of the annual budget, which is not being spent on education or infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.54,0)">On top of this, future generations will face a number of hidden costs that have not yet been factored into the debt figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.32,0)">These include the effects of an ageing society and the unknown consequences of a changing climate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.33,0)">To take the example of Germany, the European Commission projects in its 2012 Ageing Report that the working age population will fall by more than 30% by 2060.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">At the same time, its age-related spending will continue to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.75,0)">This means that, year after year, there will be an ever smaller number of workers supporting an ever larger social security system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.72,0)">Our obligation to future generations In other words, future generations are already carrying major burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Is it fair to them, by increasing debt today, to make it heavier still?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.19,0)">The economist John Maynard Keynes famously dismissed long-term considerations with the argument that “in the long-run we’re all dead”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.73,0)">This is true – we are, but our children and grandchildren are not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">By ensuring fiscal soundness today, we represent their voice in the current debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.78,0)">To sum up, I question the benefits of changing course, not because I am satisfied with the current situation, but because the alternatives available are worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.02,0)">They mean placing short-term expediency over long-term sustainability – which, for me, is the opposite of responsible policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Citizens have to take decisions of great importance about their future – most directly so when they are asked to at the ballot box.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">By casting their votes, they make choices that will not only determine their lives, but also those of the generations to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">They deserve to have the full picture of the alternatives they are facing before they do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The potential of the European strategy But citizens still rightly ask: where will growth come from?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This leads me to the second theme of my address today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.48,0)">Is the euro area condemned to a “lost decade” of low growth and high unemployment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Or are there new sources of growth we can exploit to get out of this crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.9,0)">Here, the answer depends on governments themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.18,0)">The truth is that they are not out of options when it comes to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">There are new sources of growth that can be tapped, even while budgets are being cut.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">But to do so, they have to implement the other pillar of the European strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">They have to enact deep-rooted economic reforms that increase the potential of their economies to grow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Reforms to open markets, increase competition, and remove bureaucracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Reforms to advance innovation, encourage entrepreneurship, and help public administration actually serve the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.58,0)">These reforms are not easy to implement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">They require tough choices, perseverance to confront vested interests, and patience for the effects to become visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Reforms as the path to growth… But their potential is huge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">To give a sense of what can be achieved, recent research from the IMF   finds that euro area countries could boost their GDP by more than 3% over five years by opening markets to competition and reforming tax systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">And they could also do a lot to support growth by removing the remaining barriers to a Single Market in Europe – in particular by completing the Single Market in services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The European Commission estimates that implementing the Services Directive – which covers activities that make up around 40% of EU GDP – could reap additional gains of 330 billion euro, or more than 2.5% of EU GDP, over five to ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And this only requires implementing legislation that has already been agreed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">…and fairness Higher growth is not the only benefit from reforms: they also contribute to a social fairness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">As the OECD Going for Growth 2012 report put it, this is the “Double Dividend” of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.22,0)">Commentators who criticise the social consequences of the European strategy often forget this element and focus only on the effect of budget cuts – which can sometimes fall hardest on vulnerable groups in society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">But well-designed reforms can have the opposite effect: they can in fact create opportunities for people on the margins of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.7,0)">Let me allude to this: In Spain, there is a rigid two-tier labour market which protects insiders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.73,0)">This means that young people, on flexible contracts, bear the burden of an economic downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.78,0)">As a result, almost 6 out of 10 are currently unemployed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.38,0)">In another country, the administration of tax collection is weak which leads to enormous amounts of tax arrears.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.8,0)">As a result, ordinary people who are taxed on their salaries have to pay more to make up the difference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">These are both cases where lack of reforms leads to unfair outcomes – and so where structural reforms could help towards a fairer society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Ultimately, with structural reforms, the winners outnumber the potential losers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is time this message gets more attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.11,0)">The never-ending race However, we should not fall into the trap of thinking that it is only struggling countries that need to take hard decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">We are all competing today, both within Europe and with the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There can be no sitting back, for any country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.41,0)">Germany was a decade ago called ‘the Sick Man of Europe’; people were wondering publicly if “Germany can be saved”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Since then, the country has become a showcase of how well-designed reforms can turn the situation around.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">But this example also serves as warning – others can just as quickly catch up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.5,0)">If struggling countries continue to pursue ambitious reforms, and Germany rests on its laurels, it could once again be this country left in the slow lane.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">So it also needs to tap new sources of growth, like professional services, that remain unreformed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Conclusion Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.56,0)">The challenge avoiding false alternatives, and taking the hard decisions, is not a new one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Niccolo Machiavelli observed in the 16th century that, “There is nothing more difficult to carry out than to institute a new order of things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.83,0)">Because the reformer has for enemies all those who have profited under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.”   We at the ECB are no different: we also have structural problems to address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.7,0)">And since I am speaking at the “Women in European Business” conference, let me focus on one in particular: the underrepresentation of female staff in our management positions and governing bodies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">For a very long time, I was personally not in favour of any kind of affirmative action, because I was convinced that qualified women would eventually make their way to the top.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.41,0)">But I have come to realise that this is not the case – neither in the working environments I am familiar with, nor on a wider scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">I was struck when I heard that it will take more than 70 years to achieve gender-balance in the UK’s largest 100 companies if the current rate of change is maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">The ECB’s Executive Board recently discussed enhancing gender diversity in our management and decided that, from now on, we will not only talk about diversity – we will act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">All studies show that the commitment from the top is key to bringing about change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">The commitment is there – we want new measures and the board has asked its Human Resources department to provide these to us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Other international financial institutions like the IMF and the EIB as well as the European Commission are more advanced and have introduced gender targets, which define specific quantitative – albeit non-binding – goals for employing women at various levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">We think that we can learn from the experience of these institutions and that their targets may serve as a benchmark for us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">This marks a significant change, especially in the generally rather conservative world of central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">All change implies a challenge, especially for those at the top of the organisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.91,0)">But leadership must be challenged to keep it relevant – which is another theme of this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The key issue is how, when challenged, it answers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.72,0)">The current concerns about where Europe is heading are a challenge to our leadership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.29,0)">They have to be properly answered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Not by resorting to populism or false alternatives – but by reaffirming, clearly and honestly, why the path we are taking is the right one.</span>
