    <span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)"> Towards a new collateral landscape Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 2nd Joint Central Bank Seminar on Collateral and Liquidity hosted by the ECB and the Deutsche Bundesbank,Hamburg, 17 September 2014 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to open the second day of the Second Joint Central Bank Seminar on Collateral and Liquidity, hosted by the European Central Bank   and the Deutsche Bundesbank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">I will reflect on the developments we are seeing in what is often referred to as the “new collateral landscape” and, in particular, consider the role central banks have played and can continue to play in order to help shape this new landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In this regard I will concentrate on the 1) eligibility, 2) availability and 3) mobility of collateral assets, as these elements represent some of the key subjects in the unfolding collateral landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Looking back at developments in recent years, it is clear that the financial crisis and the accompanying regulatory reforms have assigned a more prominent role to collateral and placed greater emphasis on high-quality assets in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">We have seen a clear shift away from the use of unsecured funding in favour of secured funding in the money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.43,0)">This structural change alone has created new issues and challenges and it is having a significant impact on demand for collateral assets and the way monetary policy is implemented and transmitted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">One of the key topics of discussion two years ago at the First Joint Central Bank Seminar on Collateral and Liquidity, was the growing demand for collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.22,0)">At that time, concerns were emerging that collateral was becoming scarcer, with expectations that demand would substantially outpace supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.73,0)">These concerns were mainly fuelled by upcoming regulatory changes, the details of which were not fully elaborated at that time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Another prominent topic was the importance of collateral for central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">In response to the crisis, many central banks had broadened their collateral frameworks to support their counterparties in accessing central bank funding given the problems with the availability of market funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Taking the various elements together, there was general agreement that demand for collateral assets would indeed increase in the forthcoming years and hence collateral would become relatively scarcer, although an absolute collateral scarcity was unlikely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.26,0)">A subsequent study carried out by the Basel Committee on the Global Financial System   and published in 2013 reconfirmed this view, noting that while this increase in demand could lead to “temporary shortages in some countries”, concerns about an absolute shortage of high-quality collateral assets appeared unjustified, given that the supply of collateral assets had risen significantly since the end of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Today, almost two years after the First Joint Central Bank Seminar, a new set of issues related to this relative scarcity of collateral is coming to the forefront.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.25,0)">The regulatory framework is becoming clearer, but concerns are being raised about the impact of the new post-crisis regulatory regime on the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Eligible collateral First, I would like to focus on the aspects related to the eligibility of assets for use as collateral in central bank credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As you well know, collateral eligibility criteria are defined by central banks first and foremost to protect central banks, and ultimately taxpayers, from the credit risk inherent in their credit operations with commercial banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The Eurosystem is very clear on this aspect and the ‘adequacy’ of assets for use as collateral is stipulated as a condition for lending in Article 18.1 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The legal interpretation in this respect is clear and consistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This concept of adequacy focuses on the “qualitative” aspect of assets that may be used as collateral with the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The adequacy of collateral in this respect is ensured via the following pillars:   market valuation should be the rule whenever possible,   proper legal due diligence both as regards the asset to be accepted as collateral and also as regards the collateralisation technique used   there should be minimum credit quality requirements and stringent rules and performance monitoring for all systems used to assess the credit quality of eligible assets and   risk control measures, normally in the form of haircuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Another point I would like to emphasise is that the Eurosystem has been working to mitigate inherent pro-cyclicality in its collateral framework by extending it, by aiming at calibrating risk parameters over a medium-term horizon, avoiding strong reactions to temporary market movements, and eliminating cliff effects and broadening its acceptance of credit risk assessment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">I would also highlight that the Eurosystem’s collateral framework which should cater for a level playing field in the euro area through a Single List of eligible assets, is an important factor in promoting the standardisation and harmonisation of relevant laws in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.17,0)">The Eurosystem often has to face the fact that different aspects of securities laws in Europe are not yet properly harmonised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.46,0)">The Eurosystem eligibility criteria often de facto shape national and European rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In the discussion on high-quality securitisation, the eligibility criteria of the Eurosystem could be a good starting point for future regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Availability of collateral Moving on, I would like to speak about the proportion of high quality assets that is effectively available to market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">With the greater reliance on collateralised funding and regulatory reforms undertaken in response to the financial crisis, it is clear that the share of banks’ assets that are encumbered is rising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This intensifies the need for greater visibility regarding the amount of high-quality assets actually available for use as collateral or for regulatory purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">In a recently-published study, the ECB compared data for the overall global supply of high-quality assets with the share of such assets effectively available to the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">On the basis of existing data, the study concluded that the overall global supply stands at the equivalent of around €41 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.63,0)">However, a significant proportion of this overall supply, representing at least 25%, was identified as being blocked on safe-keeping accounts of investors or central banks for policy-related purposes – so-called “idle securities”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.59,0)">The availability of assets was also found to be constrained by shortcomings related to settlement arrangements, bringing the total for available high quality assets to an amount closer to the equivalent of €29 trillion – some €11 trillion less than the figure I referred to at the outset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Overall this still leaves a sufficient buffer of high-quality assets available for market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Currently, collateral usage is the equivalent of around €10 trillion and it is expected that the increased demand due to mandatory CCP clearing and other regulatory reforms would be at most in equivalent of between €2-4 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Nonetheless, we need to take into account that the available assets may not be equally available to all market participants in all regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It is therefore important to monitor trends and developments in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In this respect, securitisation could be the appropriate relief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The recent joint paper by the ECB and the Bank of England   on the need for regulatory changes in the treatment of asset-backed securities   is also to be considered here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The ECB is currently exploring aspects related to collateral velocity – in other words the rate of use and reuse of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.04,0)">Some studies   have estimated that collateral is reused around three times on average, however, there are indications that this rate has declined since the onset of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">As such, further work could provide a clearer picture across a wider range of assets and markets, with triparty collateral management systems serving as a good starting point to better grasp the rate of reuse in secured financing markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Another important element that affects the availability of collateral assets is settlement arrangements and, here again, the Eurosystem is working with the market to see how enhancements to settlement arrangements could overcome existing inefficiencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Given that settlement arrangements influence both the availability and mobility of collateral, I will move on to the topic of mobility and address settlement arrangements in parallel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Mobility of collateral An important function of collateral in financial markets is that it should have the capacity to ‘change hands’ when needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Thus, collateral should be mobile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.23,0)">Inefficiencies in settlement arrangements, however, including at the level of financial market infrastructures, reduce the amount of assets that can be quickly mobilised and, therefore, the overall availability of collateral assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The Eurosystem, like other central banks, therefore supports and fosters initiatives that contribute to improving the availability and mobility of collateral, without overlooking the need to preserve transparency and legal certainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Let me mention first the initiatives within the Eurosystem itself – TARGET2-Securities   being the most notable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The launch of T2S will make securities settlement – including collateral mobilisation – safer and more efficient for market participants and central banks alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">With the migration to T2S, a number of operational barriers which currently exist for cross-border settlement will be removed and operational friction will be reduced, allowing collateral to move more easily from where it is, to where it is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">T2S will be an important piece in the “mosaic” of post-trade settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">T2S will overcome the technical difficulties encountered today in quickly transferring collateral assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The common and extended settlement timetables across T2S markets will also support more efficient mobilisation and management of collateral assets and, in this way, T2S is a crucial step to a better functioning financial market, at least from an operational point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The Eurosystem has also taken initiatives in relation to the services for mobilisation of collateral for its own credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">One of the most significant developments in this respect is the introduction of support for cross-border triparty collateral management services which will go-live towards the end of this month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Triparty collateral management services, as many of you well know, allow institutions to manage their assets via a triparty agent and are ultimately targeted towards optimising the use of clients’ assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">With the incorporation of these services into the Eurosystem framework on a cross-border basis, they will become operationally accessible to all Eurosystem counterparties, regardless of the location of the counterparty or the respective triparty service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.59,0)">This has raised a set of issues, primarily related to legal implementation, which also needed to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Once live, this enhancement will offer Eurosystem counterparties the ability to manage their overall collateral holdings in a more flexible and efficient manner and to flexibly switch their collateral between central bank refinancing and interbank market financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Central banks of course have not been alone in taking initiatives over the last few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">On the market, we have seen huge progress in the range and sophistication of services on offer to clients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">A new report from Basel covers developments in collateral management services across G20 countries and takes stock of the existing and upcoming services in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The many benefits gained from the innovation of service providers and the collaboration among them can be welcomed by central banks, as they allow for better information on collateral, better access to collateral and better mobility of available securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.75,0)">Indeed, it is doubtful whether market participants would cope with temporary shortages of collateral arising from the regulatory reforms without the innovation that helps in the distribution of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.06,0)">On the other hand, the increased sophistication of such services also implies increased complexity, increased operational and legal risks and, most notably, increased interdependencies stemming from new linkages between service-providing firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.9,0)">A shortage of collateral or an inability to transfer collateral promptly can in some cases be an early indicator of liquidity problems or an even deeper set of issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Close cooperation with competent supervisory and oversight authorities is therefore warranted, as the legal heterogeneity still impedes a fully functioning internal market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">As I mentioned at the outset, we have already observed a significant change in the collateral landscape over the last few years and it is a landscape that is continuing to evolve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">In particular, key regulatory reforms have yet to make a real impact in the market and innovation in post-trade arrangements will be further pursued by the public and private sectors alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.34,0)">Although the overall global supply of high-quality assets appears substantial, existing regional imbalances mean that we cannot become complacent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">We must also continue to be vigilant regarding issues affecting availability and mobility, and take actions that address the factors that hamper the fluid transfer of assets, without mistaking liquidity and solvency issues for market inefficiencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In Europe, the T2S project has made significant progress and, when implemented, it will be a significant step forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">T2S allows for more efficient cross-border collateral flows so that collateral in one country will be easily accessible in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">This also offers possibilities for establishing linkages between T2S Central Securities Depositories   and those from other geographical areas, which could ultimately lead to the creation of a more global network for the mobilisation of collateral assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">This type of global reach will make it more attractive to connect to Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In view of the planned discussion on bringing the right collateral to the right place at the right time, I will leave you with these suggestions for further reflection and I look forward to receiving feedback on your deliberations in due course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">I would like to end by wishing you an enjoyable second day of the seminar, with lively and fruitful discussions and I look forward to further cooperation among central bankers on the topic of collateral in all its forms in the months and years ahead.</span>
