    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)"> European financial integration Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBDanmarks NationalbankCopenhagen, 3 October 2005 Introduction Dear Bodil, Ladies and Gentlemen, When Danmarks Nationalbank invited me to speak today, I had no hesitation in accepting its invitation, although my feelings towards the occasion being marked are somewhat ambivalent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.87,0)">When our host, Ms Bodil Nyboe Andersen, leaves her post as Governor of Danmarks Nationalbank at the end of this month the European System of Central Banks   and the ECB will lose a highly esteemed member of its General Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">As much as we regret saying farewell to you, dear Bodil, we are also looking forward to an equally fruitful cooperation with your successor, Mr Nils Bernstein.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Dear Bodil, during our many years of collaboration, I, like so many others, have come to admire your manifold achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Let me name but one: the skill with which you have managed the Danish exchange rate regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">During your tenure, the credibility of this policy has gone from being very high to being exceptionally high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.02,0)">This is illustrated by the fact that during the past year the exchange rate of the Danish kroner to the euro has fluctuated by less than 0.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">This is a remarkable success on the part of Danmarks Nationalbank, but it is also your personal success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The exchange rate policy is undisputed in your country, not least because the central bank and its Governor enjoy such a high degree of credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">This also means that, in an economic sense, Denmark is closely linked to the euro area economy and is thus also in a position to participate to a large extent in financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This brings me to the topic of my speech today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Today, I would like to speak about European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In so doing, I will address two main questions: Why is the Eurosystem so deeply interested in European financial integration?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">and What can the Eurosystem do to contribute to fostering European financial integration?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me mention here also that I use the term “European” financial integration in a broad sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Of course, as the President of the ECB, my primary area of responsibility lies with the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">However, there are numerous links between the euro area and the remainder of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The Eurosystem’s interest in European financial integration There are several reasons for the Eurosystem’s interest in European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The basic, institutional reasoning is that under Article 105 of the Treaty the ECB and the entire Eurosystem “shall without prejudice to the objective of price stability,   support the general economic policies in the Community”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As we know, financial integration is an important component of the general economic policy of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">While I will explain in a moment that financial integration is indeed conducive to the smooth implementation of the single monetary policy within the euro area, let me reiterate that, as the Treaty states and as the ECB has demonstrated since its inception, monetary stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Of course, financial integration is not an end in itself but it has various economic benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Financial systems – composed of financial institutions, markets and the financial infrastructure – serve a number of basic purposes, such as trading, hedging, diversifying and pooling risk, as well as allocating resources and mobilising savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">These functions determine the economic benefits that can be derived from financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Two widely accepted economic benefits of financial integration are better sharing and diversification of risk and the potential for higher economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me explain this in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">First, the better diversification and sharing of risk brought about by financial integration helps to fulfil the conditions for the optimality of a currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">In recent years, an interesting development with regard to the theory of optimal currency areas has been the idea that the optimality of a currency area is not necessarily something that needs to be fully reached before monetary union but can be helped achieving by monetary union itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The introduction of the euro clearly fostered financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Economic agents from a given region can, by more easily investing in other regions of the area, diversify the risk of potential shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Steps towards increased financial integration reduce the risk of local factors impacting on the income and consumption of a given region within the area, thereby helping to fulfil the conditions for an optimal currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Second, financial integration is a key factor in the development of the financial system, which, in turn, increases the potential for greater and more sustainable non-inflationary economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">It is generally accepted that financial integration fosters financial development and, ultimately, economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Financial integration allows economies of scale and increases the supply of funds for investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The integration process fosters competition and the expansion of intermediation and markets, thereby leading to further financial development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Financial development, in turn, leads to lower intermediation costs, a more efficient allocation of capital and, thus, a potential for higher economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">You will probably share the view that the growth performance of the euro area cannot be deemed fully satisfactory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">From 1999 to 2004, real GDP in the euro area grew by an average of 1.9% per annum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Looking back over the last ten years, the average annual growth rate in the 12 countries that today form the euro area has been 2.1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">But it is equally true to say that the single monetary policy, geared torwards price stability and the anchoring of inflation expectations, lends ongoing support to economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.48,0)">Across the maturity spectrum, interest rates in the euro area are low by historical standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.68,0)">Thus, if you will allow me to look at a third time span, it is worth noting that we are in fact delivering today a nominal yield curve at historically low levels, as low as ever observed in Europe since the beginning of the 20th century!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Allow me now to look briefly at the “real” side of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Long-term potential growth in the euro area is estimated to be between 2% and 2.5%, probably much closer to 2% than to 2.5%, given demographic trends and prevailing market structures, and assuming that economic policies remain unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">As regards structural reforms, the European Commission recently presented the “Community Lisbon Programme”, which contains a list of measures at the EU level for relaunching the Lisbon strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The programme focuses on enhancing knowledge and innovation in order to strengthen growth, on making Europe a more attractive place to invest and work, and on creating more and better jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">The Community Lisbon Programme will be complemented by the introduction of national action plans for growth and jobs, which the Member States will present this autumn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">That such economic reforms can indeed be implemented in a successful way has been demonstrated by the Nordic European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Structural reforms are urgently needed for labour, goods and services markets in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Labour markets need to become more flexible in order to support the creation of new jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.49,0)">Structures in goods and services markets still present considerable barriers to competition, hindering the process of Schumpeterian “creative destruction” and preventing possible productivity gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And while not confined to the “real” side of the economy, one such structural reform along the lines of the Lisbon strategy is the process of European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">To give a concrete figure  , let me mention that a recent study estimates that financial integration of the European bond and equity markets would result in additional growth of around 1% over a ten-year period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It is worth noting that 1% of EU GDP amounts to around EUR 100 billion!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">But in addition to the general economic benefits of financial integration that I have mentioned, fostering financial integration is of particular importance for the ECB’s tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">First, integrated and efficient financial markets enhance the smooth and effective transmission of monetary policy impulses throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">The higher the degree of financial integration, the more effectively this transmission will work in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In this context, I should also mention another basic task of the Eurosystem under the Treaty, namely the promotion of the effective operation of payment systems, as well as the Eurosystem’s interest in the smooth running of securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Payment and settlement systems are the main channels through which liquidity flows, and only if the whole infrastructure is adequately integrated can the system function smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The integration of these financial infrastructures is therefore very relevant for the smooth implementation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Furthermore, the integration of the financial system is highly relevant to the ECB’s task of safeguarding financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">On the one hand, deeper financial integration can increase the capacity to absorb economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">It can also offer more possibilities for financial institutions to better manage and diversify their relevant risks and realise economies of scale, leading to greater efficiency of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">On the other hand, particular attention has to be given to the profound changes of nature of the financial stability challenges due to the structural transformation of the financial system, including intensified cross-border links.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Let me mention here that among the ECB’s various contributions to the discussions on financial stability, we have, since December 2004, provided the public with our biannual Financial Stability Review, which is the outcome of our euro area-wide financial stability monitoring activities, conducted with the support of the Banking Supervision Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Danmarks Nationalbank also introduced, in 2002, an annual financial stability report for Denmark, and this, dear Bodil, is another of the many achievements of your term as Governor of Danmarks Nationalbank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">So let me conclude my response to the first of the two main questions which I wish to address today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I have explained the institutional and economic reasoning underlying our interest in European financial integration, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.33,0)">the “Why?”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In fact, all of these reasons have found expression in the Eurosystem’s mission statement formulated by the Governing Council of the ECB, the relevant part of which reads as follows: “The Eurosystem, which comprises the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the Member States whose currency is the euro, is the monetary authority of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">We in the Eurosystem have as our primary objective the maintenance of price stability for the common good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Acting also as a leading financial authority, we aim to safeguard financial stability and promote European financial integration.”  The mission statement of the Eurosystem brings me neatly on to the second question which I would like to address today, namely the “What?” – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">what kind of contribution can the Eurosystem make to fostering European financial integration?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The Eurosystem’s contribution to the fostering of European financial integration We generally distinguish four types of activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">First, we contribute to financial integration by providing central banking services that also foster European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Second, we can act as a catalyst for private-sector activities by facilitating collective action and assisting with possible coordination problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Third, we give advice on shaping the legislative and regulatory framework for the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">And fourth, we try to enhance knowledge and raise awareness of the state of and need for European financial integration, and we measure the progress made torwards its achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.11,0)">I will examine all these four kinds of activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I will start with the one I mentioned last, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">enhancing knowledge and raising awareness of European financial integration, and measuring the progress made torwards its achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In this respect, I will take the opportunity to present a number of facts about the state of integration of the euro area financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">3.1 Measuring the progress of European financial integration Only last Friday the ECB published, for the first time, a series of indicators regarding the state of integration of euro area financial and banking markets, together with an explanatory report entitled “Indicators of financial integration in the euro area”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">This publication, aimed at measuring and monitoring financial integration in the euro area on the basis of quantitative indicators, is a new initiative by the ECB and is in line with our understanding of our mandate to contribute to the process of European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The indicators will be regularly updated and published on the ECB’s website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The publication provides an overall assessment of the degree of financial integration in the broad spectrum of segments of the euro area financial markets, ranging from retail loans to wholesale equity trading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me now present our findings in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Our 20 indicators cover the money market, the government bond market, the corporate bond market, the equity market and banking markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">While the euro has undoubtedly acted as a catalyst for financial integration in general, it is true that the degree of integration differs from market segment to market segment, with integration being more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.62,0)">Money market The money market is broadly defined as the market for interbank short-term debt or deposits and consists of various segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Our report suggests three indicators for measuring financial integration, based on the dispersion of lending rates – namely overnight rates, unsecured lending rates, and repo rates – offered by banks among euro area countries, with the data referring to actual transactions or offered rates by EONIA, EURIBOR and EUREPO panel banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">These indicators point to a high overall degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">The unsecured interbank market has, since shortly after the introduction of the euro, been integrated to a quasi-perfect extent, shown by the respective indicators that display a euro area cross-country standard deviation of only around one basis point and below.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">While some lower degree of liquidity of the repo market, in particular in the longer-term segment, should be borne in mind, the indicator for this market also suggests a high degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.32,0)">In this respect, the indicators reveal that the euro area cross-country standard deviation of 1-month repo rates is today at around 0.5 basis points, while the one for the 12-month maturity stands at around 1.5 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Government bond market As we know, the integration of euro area government bond markets had already been progressing before the start of Monetary Union, in particular from the mid-1990s in the run up to Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Given comparable relevant characteristics, measures of integration in government bond markets, of which we suggest five indicators, are based on yield differentials with respect to a benchmark bond for different maturities, namely ten, five and two year maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">A simple measure is, for example, the standard deviation of yield spreads over time: the lower the dispersion, the higher the degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The available indicators show that, with the introduction of the euro and the removal of the exchange rate risk, government bond yields have converged in all countries, with the standard deviation in yield spreads being less than 0.1 percentage point for all three maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The indicators therefore show that the euro area government bond market has reached a high degree of integration, increasingly driven by common news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Local factors, however, will continue to have an impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.49,0)">Among those are differences in liquidity, in the availability of derivatives markets, and of course of perceived credit risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.38,0)">The impact of these factors should, from our own standpoint, not be seen as indicating a lack of integration since we consider it important that the markets assess the quality of the signatures concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Corporate bond market The euro area corporate bond market has grown considerably in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">But let me mention the fact that, despite this exceptional growth, the gap between the euro area and the United States is still large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">For example, the outstanding volume of bonds issued by non-financial corporations is now around EUR 2.4 trillion in the United States, as compared with around EUR 900 billion in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The yield differential between corporate bonds can be explained by a number of factors, such as the credit rating, time-to-maturity, liquidity and cash flow structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Under full integration, the respective impact of such factors should be totally independent of the country of issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Using such a set of specific factors, it is possible to obtain measures of corporate bond market integration by investigating whether or not risk-adjusted yield spreads have a systematic country component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.0,0)">In an integrated market, the proportion of the total yield spread variance attributable to country effects should be close to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">We published three   indicators of the state of integration of the corporate bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The indicators show that the euro area corporate bond market is fairly well integrated, in the sense that the country of issuance is only of very minor importance in explaining yield differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Equity market It is very important for monetary policy-makers to understand the dynamics of equity market integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">As equity markets grow in size, wealth effects on consumption become increasingly relevant, resulting in a tighter link between stock market fluctuations and fluctuations in real economic variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Overall, we published three   indicators of the degree of integration of the euro area equity market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">These measures for the euro area equity market indicate that the degree of integration is rising, although room for further integration remains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">One means of measuring the degree of integration in euro area equity markets is to look at the relative importance of sector versus country-based investment strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Generally speaking, the more integrated the euro area equity market, the greater the benefits of spreading investments across sectors as opposed to country-based equity investment strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">By comparing the cross-sector dispersion with the cross-country dispersion of equity returns, it is possible to derive indicators of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">One finding is that, since the end of 2000, the advantages of sector diversification seem – for the first time in the last 30 years – to have surpassed those of a geographical diversification among euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Still, diversifying across sectors and countries at the same time might result in portfolios with a lower risk than those constructed on a country or sector basis only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Thus, the importance of the country effect is still too great for it to be concluded that the euro area equity market is satisfactorily integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Furthermore, equity returns in the euro area countries are increasingly determined by common factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Based on a factor model, our finding is that the average sensitivity to common shocks has increased significantly over the last 30 years, in particular as regards euro area-wide return shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This can also be interpreted as an indication of increased integration of euro area equity markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.1,0)">Banking markets The assessment of integration in banking is conceptually complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">While banks are a well-defined type of firm, banking is a multi-product industry, in which various banking products can be exchanged in different markets of different size and geographical coverage and with different counterparts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.76,0)">One generally distinguishes between interbank   activities, capital market-related activities and retail banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In our report, we started with a set of six indicators related to banking markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">We found that retail banking markets in particular are generally far less integrated, while the euro area interbank   market and capital market-related activities show solid signs of increasing integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Indeed, cross-border inter-bank loans and cross-border holdings of securities have, in relative terms, experienced substantial growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">For example, although domestic loans granted between monetary financial institutions   still account for more than 50% of the total of EU MFI loans, the respective euro area cross-border activity has increased from around 15% at the end of 1997 to around 23% at the current time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Capital market-related activities have been even more impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">While securities issued by non-MFIs of another euro area country accounted for around 15% of the securities held by euro area MFIs at the end of 1997, this share has now reached almost 40%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">By contrast, integration in retail banking has not progressed to any great extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is suggested by both price and quantity-based indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Integration in the retail banking markets can be measured by the cross-country dispersion   of interest rates on consumer credit, lending for house purchase and deposits with an agreed maturity, with a high degree of cross-country dispersion indicating a low degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Our finding was that the degree of dispersion remains relatively high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.82,0)">This picture of a comparatively low degree of integration is also borne out by the level of banks’ cross-border retail lending activity within the euro area, which, while increasing slightly from around 2% at the end of 1997 to around 3.5% today, remains low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me now make a few brief comments on an important retail market, namely the European mortgage market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The importance of this retail market segment is evident from its size alone: an outstanding volume of more than EUR 4 trillion in residential mortgage debt in the EU, corresponding to around 40% of EU GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.67,0)">Very clearly, there are costs incurred through incomplete integration, such as the costs for households arising from differences in prices and products, and for issuers and investors as a result of unrealised economies of scale and higher funding costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.88,0)">Indeed, the secondary market for mortgage funding is still quite fragmented within the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Overall, retail funding via deposits still accounts for the largest part of the funding of mortgage loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">However, securitisation is becoming more and more important as the markets for covered bonds   and mortgage-backed securities   are growing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">For example, euro-denominated bonds covered by mortgage loans amount to around EUR 0.4 trillion by now, as, over the last few years, we have seen issuance of covered bonds begin to increase in several European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Such capital market funding instruments could indeed also facilitate the integration of mortgage markets, as mortgage loans could more easily be granted cross-border, without first requiring costly access to a local deposit base for their funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Accordingly, we are witnessing numerous initiatives by the private sector to achieve some progress in the integration of these important market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The situation of the European mortgage market, and that of retail financial services in general, has also been brought to our attention by the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First, in December 2004, the report of the European Commission’s Forum Group on Mortgage Credit was published, in which a number of recommendations for tackling barriers to the further integration of EU mortgage credit markets were made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Second, the European Commission’s Green Paper on the priorities of the financial services policy over the next five years, which was open for public consultation until 1 August, identified retail financial services as one of the areas in which financial integration is clearly lagging behind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">And third, in July, the European Commission issued a Green Paper on “Mortgage Credit in the EU” for public consultation by end November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Connected to this Green Paper consultation, the European Commission asked a research institute to prepare a study on the estimated costs and benefits of the integration of EU mortgage markets, to assess the degree to which EU mortgage markets are integrated and to identify the obstacles to their further integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The study, which was published in August of this year, concludes, with all caveats that apply to the model underlying the estimation, that full integration of EU mortgage markets would raise EU GDP by 0.7% and EU private consumption by 0.5% in 2015, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.82,0)">ten years from now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">This would thus constitute a further step in the direction of raising the EU’s growth potential which I referred to earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Having dealt with how the Eurosystem can foster European financial integration by enhancing knowledge and raising awareness of the state of and the need for fostering European financial integration and by measuring the progress made, let me now turn to the other three kinds of activity mentioned earlier: providing central banking services that are also conducive to fostering financial integration, acting as a catalyst for private-sector activities and advising on the legislative and regulatory framework for the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.69,0)">I will begin with the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">3.2 Advising on the legislative and regulatory framework for the financial system As we see it, the basic task of public authorities with regard to the process of financial integration is to create a framework whereby, generally speaking, all potential market participants in a given financial instruments or services market, are subject to a single set of rules when they decide to deal with those financial instruments or services, have equal access to this set of financial instruments or services and are treated equally when they operate in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">The Eurosystem is fully committed to this principle of integrating financial markets and the financial system as whole, both in the euro area and the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">We are committed to it both because it is required by European law and because we think it is good for the economy of the euro area and the European Union, and for the best possible functioning of the level playing field in this sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In line with this commitment, we also advise on the legislative and regulatory framework for the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me give you a few examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Very recently, at the start of August, the Eurosystem provided an opinion in response to the European Commission’s consultation on the priorities for financial services policies over the next five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">As detailed in our opinion, the Eurosystem supports the key policy orientation of the Green Paper, in particular the proposal for “better regulation” based on open, transparent and evidence-based policy-making, and the need to focus on the consolidation and consistent implementation of the legislative framework for financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">To this end, we are of the view that the potential of the Lamfalussy framework should be exploited as far as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.27,0)">In this respect, let me also recall the position expressed earlier this year by the Eurosystem in relation to the review of the so-called Lamfalussy process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">With regard to the supervisory framework, the Eurosystem fully supports the Commission’s view that the current institutional set-up should be exploited to the maximum extent before any potential structural change is considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">In particular, the Eurosystem agrees that the main policy objective in the area of financial supervision is twofold: first, to enhance the competitiveness of EU financial markets and institutions and to facilitate the development of cross-border finance both in terms of institutions and in terms of products and services; and second, to ensure the effectiveness of standards for oversight and supervision in a more integrated financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In addition to giving advice, the Eurosystem also provides standards and conditions for its own operations, or by issuing its own regulations – for example in the field of promoting and ensuring efficient and sound clearing and payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In the field of promoting the integration, efficiency, and security of the European securities infrastructure, let me mention the “Standards for Securities Clearing and Settlement in the European Union” developed by the ESCB in cooperation with the Committee of European Securities Regulators  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The field of securities clearing and settlement is an area in which further integration is needed to exploit in full the benefits arising from a pan-European securities market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">As a directive can complement the market-led removal of the “Giovannini barriers”, which is a necessary condition for competition, cost savings and improved efficiency to come fully into effect, the Eurosystem also supports the Commission’s intention to put forward a proposal for a Directive on securities clearing and settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I should now like to move on to the third kind of activity, namely the provision of central banking services that are also conducive to fostering financial integration 3.3 Providing central banking services conducive to European financial integration I have just mentioned the area of securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">From a central bank perspective, securities settlement systems play a crucial role in the Eurosystem’s collateral framework as they provide the infrastructure that allows counterparties to transfer collateral to the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In the current framework, counterparties can transfer cross-border collateral to the Eurosystem via two main channels: via links between securities settlement systems   and via the correspondent central banking model  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I would like to say a few words on the CCBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.13,0)">The CCBM was created as an interim model that would cease to operate as soon as the market had developed comprehensive and reliable alternatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">That said, it is still the main instrument for mobilising cross-border collateral, with a share of over 80% at the end of 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.86,0)">Despite considerable improvements in the efficiency of CCBM processing procedures, market participants have on various occasions expressed the view that the CCBM is not yet able to meet all of banks’ needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Taking note of these trends in collateral business practices, the Eurosystem has invited market participants to rethink current arrangements by focusing on possible future alternative cross-border collateral facilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Another obvious example in the area of providing central banking services is our payment system, TARGET, which has clearly fostered European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">TARGET was operational from the first day of Monetary Union as a platform for balancing liquidity surplus and deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">TARGET today represents around 90% of the total traffic in large-value payments in euro and is one of the two largest wholesale payment systems in the world, alongside Fedwire in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">And TARGET2 will further improve financial integration, as it will enable the provision of a harmonised level of services across Europe, supported by a single price structure for domestic and cross-border payments and new functionalities to enable banks to better integrate their euro liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Our next TARGET2 progress report, to be issued in November 2005, will provide further information on our work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">3.4 Acting as a catalyst for private sector activities I now turn to the fourth way in which we contribute to the process of European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In areas such as standard-setting and the establishment of common infrastructures, cooperation between private agents of the financial sector is as necessary as competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.98,0)">However, cooperation often fails to materialise without the aid of a catalyst.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">In most countries, the central bank plays the crucial role of catalyst, thanks to its acknowledged competence and objectivity and the numerous contacts with market participants which ensue from its basic tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">With regard to financial integration in the euro area, the Eurosystem can assume such a catalyst function in several areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.97,0)">Let me mention two examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Having touched, some moments ago, on the wholesale payment system, let me also express the Eurosystem’s support for the integration of retail payments, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">for the banking industry’s initiatives to create the Single Euro Payments Area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">A real SEPA will benefit consumers, corporates, banks, and the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The European Payments Council, the main body administering the SEPA project, has declared its intention to deliver pan-European payment instruments by the start of 2008, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">the “SEPA for citizens”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">By the end of 2010, we expect progress to have been made in developing the “SEPA for infrastructure”, i. e. complete interoperability between SEPA-compliant infrastructures in order to enable competition and market-driven consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The Eurosystem will continue its dialogue with the banking industry and other stakeholders, in close collaboration with the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The Eurosystem will also continue to monitor progress in this field by issuing its fourth SEPA progress report at the end of 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">A second example of our role as catalyst for private sector activities is the Short-Term European Paper   initiative that was set up by the ACI Financial Markets Association.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As we know, this market segment is not only smaller than its counterpart in the United States  , but it is also not yet integrated on a pan-European scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The ACI initiative aims to promote the convergence of practices through market players’ voluntary compliance with the standards set out in the STEP Market Convention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The Eurosystem supports this market-led initiative in the context of the introduction of the STEP label and the production and publication of related STEP statistics on yields and volumes which would foster integration and reduce issuers’ costs through greater market transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Concluding remarks Ladies and gentlemen, In conclusion, I will reiterate the importance of a market-driven process of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">When I said earlier that the responsibility of public authorities is to create a framework whereby all potential market participants are subject to a single set of rules, have equal access to financial instruments or services and are treated equally when operating in the market, the opportunities thus created have to be exploited by market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">It is then that true financial integration will have been achieved and we can reap in full the benefits of a single and integrated financial market in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In this historical process of building up a genuine and efficient single financial market with a single currency, I would insist on the particular importance of the catalyst role of the ECB and of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I consider it to be a major responsibility at the present juncture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Dear Bodil, Let me now wish you all the very best for your life outside the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">You are now returning to your “Alma Mater”, the University of Copenhagen, as Chairperson of the university’s board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">I am sure that this position will leave time for you to participate in the academic debate among economists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">We at the ECB would be very pleased to see you as guest at our own conferences and seminars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">You know, dear Bodil, that you will remain a member of our ‘Club’, and I say without hesitation that you will be the most honorary member of the European System of Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">We count on you in the future as well as we could count on you so efficiently in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">We count on your remarkable intellectual capacity, on your wisdom, on your experience, and on your unique professional and personal elegance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.96,0)">29-31, August 2005.</span><span
