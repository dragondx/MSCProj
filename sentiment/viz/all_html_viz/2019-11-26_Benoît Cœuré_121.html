    <span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)"> Brussels, 26 November 2019 Towards the retail payments of tomorrow: a European strategy Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Joint Conference of the ECB and the National Bank of Belgium on “Crossing the chasm to the retail payments of tomorrow” Europe has made important progress towards a true banking union in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We now have a single banking supervisor for significant institutions, a single framework for resolving failing institutions, a single fund to finance those resolution activities, and we will soon have a single backstop for that fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">There are also renewed hopes that political negotiations could soon begin on a European deposit insurance scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">The European Commission has also launched an ambitious agenda for creating a capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Although the pace at which co-legislators, and Member States in particular, have progressed on individual Commission initiatives has often been sluggish, the recent establishment of a high-level expert group might help overcome the remaining impediments and reinforce efforts to make European capital markets deeper and more liquid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Step by step, we are improving our financial structures to support a single market of half a billion consumers, underpin the stability of our single currency and channel savings towards financing sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.15,0)">One area that has received less attention from policymakers in recent years, however, is the European retail payments market, in particular point-of-sale and online payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">It is true that a lot has been achieved at the back-end of European retail payments systems, most notably under the umbrella of the Single Euro Payments Area, or SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">SEPA allows payments to be processed across borders at the same cost, and as efficiently and safely, as national payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">More recently, the Eurosystem has also introduced TARGET Instant Payment Settlement, or TIPS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This service, which was launched a year ago, enables payment service providers to transfer funds to their customers in real time, around the clock, every single day of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">And it settles the payments in central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">But progress at the back-end has not translated into similar progress at the front-end, which remains fragmented, with no European solution emerging for point-of-sale and online payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.79,0)">National providers in particular have not been able, or willing, to act in a pan-European manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">20 years after the introduction of the single currency, we still do not have a European card scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.86,0)">Ten European countries currently have national card schemes that do not accept cards from other EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This has led to a notable rise in the use of non-European cards for non-cash payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.26,0)">At the end of 2016, the share of transactions made with international card schemes was a little more than two-thirds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.05,0)">It is unfortunate that past harmonisation initiatives have failed to explore the significant economies of scale that the Single Market offers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In addition, the current situation has attracted new initiatives that aim to overcome shortcomings in cross-border retail payments by building a new separate payments ecosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">These initiatives highlight the rapidly rising consumer demand for payment services that work across borders and that are also faster, cheaper and easier to use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Among younger people in particular, there is a willingness and curiosity to use new technologies and try new providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.5,0)">Relying exclusively on non-European and new ecosystems presents two risks, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The first relates to the untested nature of some initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Global stablecoin arrangements, for example, raise potential risks across a broad range of policy domains, such as legal certainty, investor protection, financial stability and compliance with anti-money laundering requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Public authorities have made clear that the bar will be set very high for these stablecoin initiatives to be allowed to operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The second risk relates to the autonomy and resilience of European payments systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.02,0)">Dependence on non-European global players creates a risk that the European payments market will not be fit to support our Single Market and single currency, making it more susceptible to external disruption such as cyber threats, and that service providers with global market power will not necessarily act in the best interest of European stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Strategic autonomy in payments is part and parcel of the European agenda to assert the euro’s international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.12,0)">The rising challenges to our global governance system have contributed to the belief that the EU may be more exposed to the risk that the monetary power of others is not used in its best interests, or is even used against it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">The Eurosystem’s retail payments strategy: a pan-European vision The only effective response to these risks is for European stakeholders to step up their collaboration and act together to provide payment solutions that both reflect the demands of consumers and strengthen the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">With this in mind, earlier this month the ECB’s Governing Council decided to relaunch its retail payments strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">The aim of our strategy is to inter alia actively foster pan-European market initiatives for retail payments at the location of the purchase or interaction – so-called point-of-interaction, or POI, payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In the view of the Governing Council, these market initiatives would have to fulfil five key objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Pan-European reach and customer experience Customers should be able to make POI payments throughout the entire European Union just as efficiently and safely as in their home country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">To this end, pan-European reach with wide merchant acceptance and a sound and efficient governance   is needed to achieve critical mass, which is necessary for a network industry, and to fully exploit the benefits of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Scale will drive consumer adoption and trust, which is pivotal in e-commerce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Convenient and cost-efficient A European retail payments solution will only be accepted if it fully addresses user needs and demands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">So the solution needs to enable an easy, flexible, secure and user-friendly payment experience for both consumers and merchants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This requires that payments can be performed using different tools and instruments, such as payment cards, mobile phones, wearables and instant payments, as well through other channels and technologies, such as near-field communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Relying on previously unavailable instant payments technology could be the key to designing a solution that is more efficient than existing ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Subsequent cost savings for merchants will eventually lower consumer prices and benefit every citizen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Safety and security A new European payments solution must comply with all relevant legal and regulatory requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">It should provide the highest levels of fraud prevention and offer consumer protection with robust complaint and refund procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">European identity and governance A common brand and logo should be adopted to foster European identity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">A European governance structure could enable European payment stakeholders to have a direct influence on the strategic direction and business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">These stakeholders should be incentivised to design a payment solution under their governance that meets the needs of European customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Global acceptance To fully meet the needs of end users, a new European solution should also be accessible to merchants based outside the EU, which will reinforce economies of scale and domestic adoption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Global acceptance should therefore be a long-term goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The need for a pan-European market-led solution These five key objectives form the heart of the Eurosystem’s retail payments strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">They provide a conceptual vision that should be fleshed out by the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The Eurosystem therefore welcomes the strategic initiative of a number of major European banks to create a true pan-European retail payment solution that has the potential to meet the vision of our strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The proposed solution would be based on the SEPA credit transfer instant   scheme, which is in our view the correct approach as it is future-oriented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">And it could capitalise from day one on existing powerful and sophisticated infrastructures, such as the Eurosystem’s TIPS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">What is now needed, however, is a strong commitment from the proponents of the new initiative, and a clear roadmap to meet the envisaged objectives, so that we can see tangible actions emerge soon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Proponents should also work closely with the European Commission to ensure that any project will be open and comply with EU competition rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This also means that if and when other initiatives emerge, they will of course be considered equally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Public initiatives may be useful and needed from time to time to support industry-led solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The European Commission, for example, could propose legislation obliging payment service providers to adopt instant payments within a certain period if a critical mass has not been reached by, say, the end of 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Other regulatory changes may be needed in due course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">For its part, the Eurosystem stands ready to provide additional technical assistance where useful and required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">For example, we will analyse how we could support the search for solutions that ensure that SCT Inst-compliant clearing mechanisms can be fully integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.14,0)">Current private solutions for the clearing of instant payments still have not addressed interoperability issues in a satisfactory manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This requires further analysis and action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">The ECB will also continue to monitor how new technologies change payment behaviour in the euro area, for example through a reduced demand for cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">We will explore how, and to which extent, central banks would need to adapt their policies and instruments to face challenges to consumer protection and monetary policy transmission that could arise from such changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">For example, a central bank digital currency could ensure that citizens remain able to use central bank money even if cash is eventually no longer used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">A digital currency of this sort could take a variety of forms, the benefits and costs of which the ECB and other central banks are currently investigating, being mindful of their broader consequences on financial intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.06,0)">But potential central bank initiatives should not discourage or crowd out private market-led solutions for fast and efficient retail payments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Global payments markets are undergoing a transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.55,0)">Rapid technological progress, regulatory reforms and rising cross-industry initiatives, in particular by large global digital firms, have led to unprecedented dynamics and are putting established banks and payment service providers under considerable pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.79,0)">In this environment, there are clear signs that Europe is at risk of losing its economic edge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.53,0)">Country-specific solutions lack the necessary size and scale, and national fragmentation has paralysed competition and stifled innovation on the pan-European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.7,0)">In the worst case scenario, this may endanger the autonomy of European payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The vision of an industry-led, pan-European retail payment solution is therefore at the heart of the Eurosystem’s retail payment strategy that I have outlined this morning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">A pan-European strategy that facilitates instant, secure and inexpensive payments – both online and in brick and mortar stores – has the potential to make up lost ground and meet the rising needs of consumers for efficient cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Better affordability, quality and choice will also promote financial inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The Eurosystem therefore welcomes the recent initiative of European banks to join forces and envisage a payment solution for the euro area as a whole.</span>
