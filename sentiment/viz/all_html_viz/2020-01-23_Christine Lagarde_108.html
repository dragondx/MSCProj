    <span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)"> Davos, 23 January 2020 How can a united Europe meet the challenges it faces today?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Opening remarks by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, during a dinner on "Uniting Europe" at the World Economic Forum This year marks the 70th anniversary of the Schuman declaration, which first put forward the idea of a single authority to govern the production of coal and steel in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Robert Schuman’s method for building Europe was clear: “Europe will not be made all at once”, he said, but “through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">His idea was that, by taking deliberate policy steps to become interdependent – like sharing raw materials – European countries would become inseparable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">And indeed they have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">We have become both safer and richer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">The formation of the Single Market gives every EU citizen average welfare gains of €840 each year .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.31,0)">Today, Schuman’s sequence is, in some ways, being reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Interdependence is now being driven increasingly by a fast-changing global environment – and policymaking has to catch up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">European countries have joint exposures to the climate, to the global economy, to multinational firms, to foreign powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">And now we need to work together to address them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.47,0)">So what does that mean practically?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">There are three key aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The first is demonstrating what is needed to make openness globally sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The EU is the most advanced example of cross-border economic and political integration because it has invested in institutions to ensure fairness – a single court and a single set of rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.01,0)">And when new forces have arisen with the potential to undermine openness – the threat of competitive devaluations or of financial spillovers – Europe has not responded by raising barriers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Rather it has sought – and is seeking – to fill the gaps in its economic and monetary union with institutional innovations like the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">At a time when trade tensions are rising even as global institutions are being weakened, these examples can provide useful lessons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The second aspect is leveraging the areas where the EU is powerful, namely the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">The EU has become a leader in ensuring strict and fair competition laws which are enforced at arm’s length .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.52,0)">This is crucial at a time when winner-takes-all dynamics are increasing in many markets, which raises concerns about firms’ political and market power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">For example, in 2018 the average monthly cost of broadband was about 100% higher in the US than in Europe .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Lobbying expenditures in the US are also estimated to be twice as high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">So this is an area where Europe really gives power back to ordinary people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Being the world’s largest exporter of manufactured goods and services and the biggest export market for around 80 countries gives the EU considerable power as a global standard-setter, too .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.01,0)">In the past this capacity mainly affected technical areas that were less visible to the public, like chemicals and food standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">But today it clearly helps us to protect and share our values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.88,0)">Take for example the EU’s Data Protection Directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Since it was passed, over 30 countries have adopted EU-type privacy laws, including most OECD countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Reflections are now also under way on how the EU’s market force can be harnessed to accelerate the fight against climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The third aspect is linking Europe’s potential more visibly to people’s concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.95,0)">If we ask Europeans today what they see as the main issues for the EU, 38% say climate change or the environment, 34% say immigration and 30% say the economic situation or unemployment .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.18,0)">These are mostly challenges that have a cross-border, geopolitical or technological dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The upshot is that the areas where Europe adds the most value – addressing challenges that are beyond the remit of nation states alone – are the areas where people now want to see results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This provides a huge opportunity for the EU to connect more strongly with its citizens and to strengthen the foundations of the European project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Doing so would in turn set the stage for integration in more complex areas, like fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Empirical evidence suggests that EU citizens tend to be much more supportive of economic integration if it rests on a sense of togetherness rather than focusing solely on maximising economic performance .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">In the spirit of Schuman, a united Europe is one that acts with Europeans’ common good at heart and addresses their challenges in a tangible way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">If we look to our past, we are reminded that economic integration can only be sustainable if it is based on a culture of stability, fairness and togetherness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">And if we look ahead, it is clear that a united Europe needs to provide the public goods that will shape our common future: turning challenges into opportunities in our natural, digital and economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">And the ECB, within its mandate, will play its role in upholding this spirit and tackling the shared challenges we face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Philippon, Thomas  , The Great
