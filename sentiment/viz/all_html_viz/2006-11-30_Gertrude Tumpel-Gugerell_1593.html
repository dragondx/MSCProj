    <span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)"> TARGET2-Securities: from vision to reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">The Eurosystem’s contribution to an integrated securities market Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBEU Commission’s Conference on “The EU’s new regime for clearing and settlement in Europe”Brussels, 30 November 2006   Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the organisers of the conference for inviting me to speak to you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">I have noticed the wide range of topics that have been touched upon this morning and will continue to be debated later today, addressing developments in financial infrastructures as well as EU policy issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In my speech, I would like to mention to you the Eurosystem’s proposal for what we call TARGET2 – Securities, or T2S in short, a new settlement service for securities transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I have organised my remarks as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">First I will mention the T2S interaction with other EU Commission projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">I will then highlight the objectives of the Eurosystem initiative in securities infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Thereafter I will outline the potential benefits of T2S for users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Finally I will conclude by mentioning the next steps of the project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">T2S and the interaction with other EU Commission projects Before describing the details of T2S, I would like to tell you the way I see the interaction between the Eurosystem initiative on T2S and the other initiatives recently taken by the EU Commission, among others the Code of Conduct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">TARGET2-Securities is not a lone-runner in introducing innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">It is part of a wider set of complementary initiatives to solve the problems relating to integration in post-trading infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Consequently, TARGET2-Securities shares the same objective as other public initiatives in this field, most notably the Code of Conduct prepared by the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">The common objective is to achieve higher efficiency and lower costs through greater competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">The Code of Conduct pursues this objective through the self-commitment of CSDs to provide price transparency, to facilitate access and interoperability, and to implement service unbundling and accounting separation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">TARGET2-Securities does it from an operational angle, in the way that I will later describe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is why the European Commission has stated its support TARGET2-Securities from the start.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Both initiatives reinforce one another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Indeed, also the European Parliament has also concluded that “until such time as an   infrastructure may have been introduced, an ECB governance must be put in place”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Background for the Eurosystem initiative in securities infrastructure Let me say something about the background relating to the Eurosystem initiative itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In July of this year, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank announced that the Eurosystem should explore, in cooperation with central securities depositories and other market participants, the setting-up of a new service for securities settlement in the euro area, TARGET2-Securities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Since then considerable work has been undertaken by the Eurosystem both internally and in conjunction with CSDs and market participants in different fora to develop this proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">To understand the essence of this proposal, one should bear in mind that over the past decade, two trends have been apparent in the development of the European securities settlement infrastructure:   There has been considerable progress in integrating settlement systems at the national level, with the result that in most European countries, there is now just one settlement platform for all types of securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">At the international level, there have been several cross-border company mergers, which have resulted in bringing CSDs in different countries under common ownership  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.68,0)">However, although these mergers have the objective of integrating settlement platforms, progress has been slow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">It is widely recognised that securities settlement systems are comparatively cheaper at the national level than at the cross-border level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">While efficiency at the national level has improved, there is still no example of a fully integrated cross-border settlement system in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.18,0)">Barriers remain, in the form of different market practices, legal structures and tax procedures, in spite of the work undertaken by ECSDA to develop harmonized market practices and by the European Commission to address the “Giovannini” barriers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.11,0)">Securities settlement in Europe remains fragmented, with the result that cross-border transactions remain expensive and inefficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">It is particularly striking that, almost eight years after the introduction of the single currency, the euro area still lacks an efficient, integrated securities infrastructure that would support the operation of a single financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">A number of studies have been published that quantify the cost of post-trading activities in the EU and in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">On the other side of the Atlantic, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation  , the US institution in charge of clearing and settlement, is used in the studies as a benchmark for a fully consolidated system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">All the studies find that costs are generally higher in the EU compared to the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This is not surprising given the multiplicity of settlement engines in the Old Continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.58,0)">In the EU the number of settlement engines declined from 22 in 1998 to 19 in 2005, and the number of securities central clearing counterparties declined from 14 to The number of securities clearing and settlement systems is still rather high, in particular if we compare it to the significant progress that has been made in the integration of large-value payment systems, with the overall number standing at 4, down from the 23 that existed before the introduction of the euro and the TARGET system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.59,0)">My description illustrates the difficulty faced by independent organizations in coordinating solutions for integration across multiple countries, and involving many different participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">In 2007 the implementation of TARGET2, the new system for settlement of large-value cash payments, will present an opportunity for the European securities industry to take a leap forward in the field of securities settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">TARGET2 will, for the first time, implement a single technical infrastructure across the euro area  , enabling banks to pool liquidity across different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">This will make it possible to bring together the payments associated with securities settlement across multiple CSDs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">However, the benefit to banks of pooling liquidity cannot be achieved if TARGET2 has to maintain separate interfaces to multiple CSDs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">With the introduction of TARGET2 next year, the operational efficiency generated by a single pool of liquidity that TARGET2 allows will not be fully exploited because of the panoply of interfaces for the many CSDs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Following its introduction, TARGET2-Securities will allow to fully exploit the potential benefits stemming from TARGET2-Cash, since it will complement the possibility of having a single pool of liquidity with the possibility of a having a single entry point for settlement of securities and to bring on the same platform the cash and securities settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Objectives of the Eurosystem initiative in securities infrastructure The vision for T2S is simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It will bring together just the information and functionality required for settling securities transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">It will provide this as a service to CSDs, which will continue to be responsible for maintaining their relationships with intermediaries, investors and issuers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The new element of this concept is that the securities accounts of multiple CSDs should be maintained on a single technical platform alongside central bank cash accounts, while all the other functions – notably, the relationship with intermediaries, investors and issuers and the management of corporate actions – remain with the CSDs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">While this split is innovative, it is also logical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Settlement is the most standardized process for the CSDs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">On the other hand, the relations with intermediaries, investors and issuers are much more heterogeneous, with numerous local variations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">It is therefore possible relatively rapidly to achieve integration of the settlement process, while allowing more time for the harmonization of local market practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.66,0)">Some market participants fear that by introducing TARGET2-Securities the Eurosystem will eliminate competition in the field of securities settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The underlying assumption is that by merging CSDs settlement platforms into a single one, the Eurosystem will create a monopoly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In reality, even if there are many CSDs in Europe today, competition between them is already very limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The multitude of actors is a necessary but not sufficient condition for competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In addition, by pooling the settlement function into a single system, the market will benefit from economies of scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Each CSD will remain in charge of relations to its participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The only change will be the recourse to T2S resources for settlement services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The continuing role for CSDs in relation to intermediaries, investors and issuers means that there will continue to be choice and competition in the provision of services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">If anything, T2S will increase the possibilities for choice and competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Participants will be able to choose among multiple CSDs to access a common settlement engine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Issuers will improve the liquidity of their securities by making them directly available to a wider range of investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The ability for any bank   to offer securities settlement in commercial bank money will not be affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">The parallel provision of securities settlement services in central bank money and commercial bank money is a stimulus for central banks to provide efficient services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This is as valid for TARGET2-Securities as it is for TARGET2.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The Eurosystem intends to use its position as a public sector, supranational organization to provide leadership in a way that is impossible for other market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Such a role in overcoming sectoral or national barriers in the way of a more efficient market structure is a traditional one for central banks in many countries and consistent with the mandate of the ECB and the NCBs of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The potential benefits of T2S for users As concerns market reactions to the T2S project, at the ECB we have the impression that, while underlining the challenges of such a project, banking communities have generally provided encouraging comments to the project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.17,0)">Other market participants, in particular the CSDs, have understandably manifested some reservations and have asked for more information on how T2S will look like.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">To assuage any fears that markets may have on the T2S project, let me mention here the benefits for the markets that we are committing to deliver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Firstly, cross-border securities transaction settlement can be as efficient as domestic securities transaction settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">All markets may operate in real-time under the same settlement engine, thus allowing for a faster re-use of securities and central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">As a result, T2S will propose the same pricing for domestic and cross-border settlements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Secondly, competition will be fostered by pooling all securities that settle in central bank money in a single settlement engine accessible via multiple CSDs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">At the same time, a decentralised structure is maintained whereby each CSD is responsible for maintaining relationship with intermediaries, investors and issuers, as well as asset servicing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Thirdly, T2S will encourage CSDs to offer to their participants the opportunity, if they choose, to centralise their securities holdings in one place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.91,0)">This will depend on the readiness of CSDs to hold securities issued in other CSDs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In fact, CSDs will have an incentive to do so in order to improve their competitive position vis-à-vis their participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Fourthly, issuers may potentially reach directly a much wider set of investors, while continuing to use the same CSD they are using today, with the same procedures they are using today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Finally, the Eurosystem and its counterparties will also benefit of this efficiency for using collateral in its credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">With cross-border deliveries becoming as efficient as domestic, a new generation of Eurosystem collateral handling procedures could be implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Bringing together the securities accounts of multiple CSDs on a single platform also creates the possibility of a much more efficient cross-border settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.24,0)">The bookings for a transfer of securities from a participant in one CSD to a participant in another CSD can be made simultaneously, together with the cash movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.14,0)">This eliminates the complex   process of reserving securities and waiting for cash payments in another system before a transaction is final, something that has reduced the attractiveness of CSD links up to now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">You might ask yourself “Is there really no other alternative than T2S?” Such an alternative should be ready to provide a settlement engine that covers the whole euro area both in terms of securities settled and in terms of governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It should be ready to provide settlement of securities and central bank money in real-time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It would need to be more than an association or alliance: ensuring a way to reach decisions that are binding for all members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">It would need to preserve a role for each CSD, while at the same time promoting competition between them, like I have described earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.3,0)">We have seen nothing like this taking place so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The market process of achieving integration is different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">To be effective, it normally involves acquiring a CSD and rationalising the internal processes to reduce costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.23,0)">This process necessarily takes time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.26,0)">It is slower than the users would want and more painful than the absorbed CSD would want.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">By co-operating with the CSDs, the Eurosystem wants to achieve this integration in a way that is faster, less painful and at the same time promotes competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.32,0)">The problems of fragmentation are wider than the single currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">We are aware of the demands coming from market participants dealing in various currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We are concentrating on the euro, which is the currency for which we are responsible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It would of course be technically possible to include other currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We respect in any event that this is a decision for the central banks issuing currencies other than the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">For the Eurosystem, T2S is a project unlike any that it has undertaken before, as this project reaches out beyond banks and payments systems, into securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The Governing Council has indicated that the Eurosystem is willing to finance and operate T2S, but it also recognises that it will need the co-operation and commitment of CSDs and securities market participants in general to deliver the service successfully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Indeed, to get the greatest benefit from consulting market participants, we have announced our intentions to the markets at a very early stage and in a very transparent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">We have also been very receptive to the markets’ views on the T2S design.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Beyond the current consultations with markets, we are looking at ways to enable possible partners to participate in the design and development of the project, in a way that appropriately links the degree of commitment with the level of involvement in decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">For the Eurosystem as a whole this project is wider in scope than any that it has undertaken since the euro was introduced, as this project reaches out beyond payments systems into securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.12,0)">But for National Central Banks it is not uncommon to settle securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In fact there is a long tradition in this activity, which continues into today in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Still today both the Federal Reserve and the Bank of Japan do it as well as 3 national central banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The Eurosystem has sufficient expertise to set-up market infrastructures in a multi-country context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For example, TARGET1 was delivered for the start of monetary union in 1999, as was the Correspondent Central Banking Model   which to date is still the most widely used procedure for settling securities for central bank credit operations on a cross-border basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">TARGET2 will also be delivered soon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The Eurosystem is conscious of the complexity of the project and intends to co-operate closely with those institutions willing to co-operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.05,0)">Concluding remarks Finally, my concluding remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Let me state once again what in my view are the main benefits of the T2S project: TARGET2-Securities is expected to provide a significant contribution to increasing the settlement efficiency and the integration of the infrastructure of EU capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">TARGET2-Securities will provide a single platform for settlement of cash and securities legs of all the transactions today effected in the various CSDs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In fact, a single platform will be used for settlement of all domestic and cross-border transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What will be the next steps of the project?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Since the decision by the Governing Council in July this year, there has been a period of informal consultation with the market, which has helped us understand many of the technical issues raised by the proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Helped by these consultations, a more detailed Feasibility Study is being prepared, which will be presented to the Governing Council in February 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In order to foster further discussion with the markets, I am inviting interested parties from CSDs and banks active in the European Union, together with representatives from banking, clearing and issuer organizations, to a meeting to be held on the 18th and 19th of December this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">On the basis of the Feasibility Study, I am confident that we, at the Governing Council, will then decide how to take the T2S proposal forward in February 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I expect that this decision would include running a formal consultation with market participants on the design of the TARGET2-Securities project, and that this consultation could take place during the spring of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.73,0)">Point 15 of the European Parliament resolution on the 2005 Annual Report of the European Central Bank     These are the National Bank of Belgium, the Banco de Portugal and the Bank of Greece.</span>
