    <span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)"> The three dimensions of the euro area crisis Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Asia-Europe Economic Forum conference on European troubles, Asian worries, Brussels, 21 January 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen, dear friends,   It is a great pleasure to speak to you tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">I would like to express my appreciation to the Asia-Europe Economic Forum for its collective thinking on our common economic challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.16,0)">The economic policy debate over recent years has been preoccupied with the “European troubles” – as the conference title indicates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">It is certainly encouraging that the focus of this debate is starting to shift from: “How much worse does it get?” to “Is it finally getting better?”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">There are signs of convalescence and “re-integration” in European financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Yet, these are revertible and should by no means induce complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.53,0)">As Christine Lagarde warned last week: “We stopped the collapse, we should avoid a relapse, and it’s not time to relax”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">This holds true for analysts and policy-makers alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">There should be no “relapse” in thinking about the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">To ultimately succeed, policy action must be based on a comprehensive and principle-based diagnosis of the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.28,0)">And to obtain such a diagnosis, one sometimes has to step back and look at the overall picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">That is what I will do in today's speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.02,0)">To this end, let me start with the following basic question: what is the exact nature of the crisis that we have been discussing for so long?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.27,0)">The use of the term “crisis”, in the singular, is, in itself, somewhat misleading: all crises are combinations of several distinct phases and dimensions which all require their own specific response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.41,0)">The euro area crisis has often been described as the combination of a sovereign debt crisis, a banking crisis, and a macroeconomic crisis  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Here, I will take a different perspective and argue that some key dimensions of the crisis are not specific to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I see three key dimensions of crisis that we have to deal with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.03,0)">The first one takes the form of a classic debt deleveraging cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.57,0)">This dimension is probably the most visible materialisation of crisis but it is only a symptom of the underlying problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.79,0)">In fact, there is a deeper dimension which I will refer to as a second dimension of the crisis, the “crisis of the social contract”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.75,0)">The latter reflects a fundamental misalignment between the economic status that industrial countries have grown accustomed to and the material conditions that are affordable without a profound shift in economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.32,0)">But in engineering such a shift, a third dimension comes to the fore, namely a crisis of the institutional architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">As regards this third dimension, I will focus on the European context where policy-makers have to conduct a fundamental overhaul of EMU simultaneously with their acute crisis fighting efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I will argue that these different crisis dimensions reinforce each other and pose particular challenges for policy-makers, both in designing appropriate policy responses and in communicating them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I will also argue that, in contrast to the former two crisis dimensions, which affect all mature economies, the third dimension is the most specific to the European context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.78,0)">Three dimensions of the crisis Debt deleveraging The global deleveraging process will feature prominently in tomorrow’s conference programme, so I will restrict myself to a stylised account of the most salient features only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Its roots can be found in the pre-crisis period, when economic activity markedly exceeded the sustainable long-term trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.4,0)">This excess, which was observable in virtually all major industrialised countries, was fuelled by an aggressive accumulation of debt in various sectors of the economy, driven by, inter alia: unchecked financial innovation; the absence of binding and consistent macro- and micro-prudential policies that could prevent escalating stability risks; and a failure of financial markets to appropriately sanction failed public policies and unsound business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.8,0)">As a consequence, ever more consumption was financed by borrowing against future incomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">But instead of systematically reflecting this inter-temporal shift of consumption opportunities in higher real borrowing costs, credit conditions were largely unaffected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.02,0)">Mispricing of credit can be protracted, but it exposes the credit market to sudden reversals of sentiment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.11,0)">This occurred when a number of shocks, initially fairly confined to the US financial sector, spread sustainability fears through the global chain of financial cross-exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.63,0)">The continuous frontloading of aggregate demand through financial leverage came to an abrupt end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.36,0)">The bubble duly burst.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.47,0)">The ensuing financial turbulence quickly morphed into a general deterioration in overall credit conditions; and this dragged down economic activity and threatened fiscal sustainability in numerous countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.49,0)">Moreover, many governments had to intervene in domestic banking sectors to preserve financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.63,0)">This resulted in a massive transfer of liabilities which in some cases overwhelmed government balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me emphasise two issues at this stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">First, while the depth of the current crisis in Europe and in other industrialised countries is unprecedented in recent history, its structure is by no means unique.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.0,0)">For example, much of the above-mentioned evolution could be observed in the Asian crisis in the late 1990s and in countless currency crises in developing economies before and since.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.54,0)">Second, from a broader perspective, the concrete manifestation of the deleveraging pressures is of secondary relevance: whether the strains show up on governments’, households’ or firms’ balance sheets has important short-run distributional implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But ultimately, they confront policy-makers with the same challenges: in the acute crisis phase, they have to promote and control the balance sheet adjustments – which are necessary – by way of policies that avoid depressionary spirals of the kind seen in the 1930s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Once they succeed, economic activity will likely resume its upward trend, albeit from a lower base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">At this stage, the common challenge for policy-makers is to ‘re-base’ growth on a new and sustainable trajectory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.09,0)">And the extent of this rebasing can be substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.92,0)">For example, the latest IMF World Economic Outlook suggests that estimates for potential output in advanced economies may have to be revised downwards by around 10 percentage points in level compared with pre-crisis trends, not to mention possible revision in trend growth rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.89,0)">Given the exceptional size of the initial imbalance during the current crisis and limited flexibility in labour, product and service markets in the euro area, this deleveraging may well extend over a protracted period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A misalignment in the social contract This brings me to the second dimension of the debt crisis, which is the recognition that governments around the world have entered into long-term commitments beyond the limits of sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.32,0)">Importantly, these commitments are not necessarily the product of an explicit contract, like a bond or a loan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In fact, in large part they take the form of implicit policy promises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The re-basing of economic activity thus has broader implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.87,0)">Inevitably, it forces countries to reassess their social contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And such a reassessment is nowhere more visible than in the fiscal domain where political consensus is translated into tangible distributive choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.38,0)">To understand this dimension, it is useful to consider a stylised version of the inter-temporal government balance sheet: the government has explicit financial liabilities – as recorded in gross government debt figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And it has assets, including for instance its stakes in publicly owned companies and holdings of public capital more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But these two items are comparatively small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.43,0)">Much more important are implicit fiscal assets and liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.14,0)">Implicit fiscal assets are the discounted value of all future tax revenues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.09,0)">Implicit fiscal liabilities are the discounted value of all future primary expenditure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.25,0)">If the residual value of the balance sheet or ‘public equity’ is negative, then somebody has to pick up the bill at some point: either taxes have to increase – implying a loss for the taxpayer; or government expenditure has to be reduced – implying a loss for those who benefit from public services; or the value of the debt has to be reduced – which means a loss for the creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In this framework, monetisation of government liabilities through a permanently higher inflation rate is comparable with a tax imposed on consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.31,0)">In all industrialised economies, it is explicitly discarded by central banks’ price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.58,0)">The recognition of losses, and the choice of who has to bear such losses are essentially political decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.27,0)">They can be postponed so long as governments have easy access to market finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.36,0)">But market access can dry up, as experienced during this crisis by some countries, where potential creditors have come to doubt that they will be repaid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.09,0)">Such doubts can either pertain to the economic ability of governments to stay current on their financial obligations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.48,0)">In other words, market participants may conclude that the public sector is on the wrong side of the ‘Laffer curve’, so that a further tightening of the fiscal stance would be counterproductive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.89,0)">Or, they doubt the political ability of governments   to service their debts in view of political constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">That is, creditors may come to realise that their explicit claim on the government is not necessarily senior to the implicit promises that the government made to taxpayers and beneficiaries of government spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.04,0)">As a result, the use of government balance sheets to borrow from future generations becomes more costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.83,0)">At this point a gap opens up between the economic status that countries are accustomed to and the status that is affordable given the sustainable growth trajectory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.56,0)">In the crisis, this gap grew wider and became harder to close by the re-basing of economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.53,0)">But the gap predated the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.2,0)">Warnings on the long-run sustainability of public finances, arising from unfunded social promises in a context of ageing populations, were legion long before the crisis erupted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">And these warning were indeed addressed to most industrialised countries around the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Nonetheless, in the five years prior to the current crisis, which were marked by very favourable cyclical conditions, government spending still outpaced GDP growth in most industrialised countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In fact, this trend was more pronounced in the US and Japan – where the average growth rate in government spending exceeded the average nominal GDP growth rate by 1½ and 2 percentage points respectively – than in the euro area where this difference only amounted to around one quarter percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.82,0)">This second dimension is a crisis of the social contract, a contract that was established in the post-war era and that was fair and affordable at that time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">It was fair because it implied solidarity towards the generation that experienced the war.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It was affordable because of favourable demographics and growth prospects that were supported by rapid technological progress and a replenishment of the lost social capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">To sustain the key elements of this social contract a profound shift in economic policies is necessary in order to rethink the contract and, at the same time, elevate the long-term rate of growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.09,0)">The incomplete institutional architecture of EMU Engineering such shift in policies requires a sound and robust institutional environment with an ability to produce political consensus – which brings me to the third dimension of the debt crisis in Europe, namely the incomplete architecture of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.13,0)">In this regard, the crisis has uncovered four shortcomings in particular: first, the EU fiscal rules were incapable of promoting prudent fiscal policies in good times; second, there was no robust mechanism to prevent macroeconomic imbalances within the EU or to correct them; third, insufficient coordination of macro and micro-prudential supervision of financial sectors allowed a build-up of vulnerabilities in banking sectors; and finally, the absence of a crisis management framework frustrated efforts to contain contagion between countries and between the balance sheets of banks and sovereigns, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.91,0)">These shortcomings were a catalyst for the other two crisis dimensions: they facilitated excessive leverage throughout the economy which in turn sowed the seeds for the ongoing deleveraging crisis; they did not address the spillovers stemming from interconnected financial systems in a single currency area, and they failed to impose tough budget constraints on governments, thus allowing them to postpone their efforts to address the crisis of the social contract, and leaving them without adequate fiscal space to cushion the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.99,0)">In several European countries the current episode of fiscal austerity is sometimes attributed to the renewed focus of the institutional setting on budgetary discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.45,0)">But, in fact, the ongoing fiscal tightening is a necessary consequence of the misalignment of the social contract: already during the boom period preceding the crisis, public commitments in these countries were entered into at the cost of future generations; the crisis then revealed that: first, projected expenditure was too high in view of plausible revenues; and second, these projected revenues had to be revised downwards as the whole economy was rebased downwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.27,0)">Moreover, the problem is by no means specific to the euro area, as vividly documented by the intense political debates in other industrialised economies, such as the US, the UK or Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.64,0)">The misleading attribution of fiscal austerity to European governance arrangements creates excessive political costs for the much needed strengthening of institutions, and should be rejected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.02,0)">However, even if such attribution is misleading, it demonstrates that the three dimensions of the crisis interact in a way that creates a “political trap” in which political consensus is hampered by a wrong diagnosis of the crisis, thus delaying the necessary policy shifts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.61,0)">The "political trap" is compounded by the strong inter-governmental dimension of European governance: elected leaders are locally mandated through local political processes, that fail to internalise positive cross-country externalities arising from policy changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">For political leaders this should imply that they have to step up their efforts in clearly communicating the current economic problems and feasible options.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">At national level, they must ensure that the body politic coalesces around policies aiming at restoring the credit of the state, as this is the only way to preserve our social model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">And they must accept that European interest will be better promoted by strong community institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Crisis resolution Against this background, addressing the three dimensions of the crisis at once may appear as a daunting task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">But precisely because the dimensions are so closely intertwined, successful reforms in either one of them can trigger a virtuous circle in the others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The reform agenda should rest on several pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">At its core, a rethinking of the social contract is necessary to restore economic sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.35,0)">This clearly has to comprise some degree of spending reduction and/or tax increase, which in the short-term will negatively impact growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Yet, this should also be complemented by reforms of labour and product markets with a focus on raising work-force participation, including through longer working lives, and on increasing price flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.12,0)">Some argue that even structural reforms would immediately restrain spending and activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This needs to be strongly qualified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Structural reforms which open up closed professions and dismantle rent-seeking oligopolies in the production and distribution of goods and services can promote a shift of supply and lower prices, which in turn can sustain real incomes at times when nominal incomes do not grow or even fall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In these conditions, engineering a positive output shock will be the key remedy to the European troubles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.78,0)">It would   offset the negative shock of the “Great Recession”, when economic activity was rebased to a permanently lower level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">If it supports skills and the ability to innovate, it could even increase long-term output trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">As a further side effect, it would crucially contribute to induce a “re-convergence” of Europe’s economies, in other words, the gap between net debtor and net credit countries would be narrowed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">This in turn would facilitate consensus on a common course of action in the ongoing revamping of the institutional architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.35,0)">What is the role of monetary policy in this context?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">What it can do is to stabilise growth near its trend over extended horizons, but it cannot raise the trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Hence, it only constitutes a line of defence against an escalation of the three dimensional crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">It has resolutely addressed risks of deflationary spirals, for instance resulting from a collapse of the banking system; it has prevented the materialisation of self-fulfilling catastrophic equilibria, such as the self-fulfilling nature of redenomination risk; and it has ensured an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation to address large underutilisation of resources, to the extent that these gaps had created negative risks to medium-term price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">However, despite tentative evidence for a relaxation of financial market tensions, also in response to our recently announced Outright Monetary Transactions programme, there is no credible substitute for the positive output shock I described earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.57,0)">And triggering such an output shock is clearly a matter for elected governments, at national and European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude on a positive note.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Looking at Europe today, I believe there is growing evidence that electorates and policy-makers stand ready to address these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Concrete reforms are under way that many would have thought impossible in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Think, for example, of the major sharing of sovereignty implicit in the decision to move towards a European banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Think also of the ambitious structural reform agendas adopted in several countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Much remains to be done, but the momentum has shifted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Increasingly, European citizens understand that the upside to structural reform is enormous, given its potential to make the economy more efficient, reduce rents, and increase their standard of living.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.4,0)">Those who fear the political cost of such a shift in economic policies should bear in mind that the alternative would be a fundamental revision of the current social promises, and ultimately a debasing of the European model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">I wish to thank Fédéric Holm-Hadulla for his
