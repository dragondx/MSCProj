    <h1> Climate change and central banking </h1>
    <h2> Keynote speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the ILF conference on Green Banking and Green Central Banking </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Christine Lagarde </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.52,0)"> Climate change and central banking Keynote speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the ILF conference on Green Banking and Green Central Banking Frankfurt am Main, 25 January 2021 In the famous fable “Belling the Cat”,  a group of mice gather to discuss how to deal with a cat that is eating them one by one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">They hatch a plan to put a bell on the cat so they can hear it coming and escape before being caught.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.28,0)">When it comes to who will actually do it, however, each mouse finds a reason why they are not the right mouse for the job, and why another mouse should do it instead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.13,0)">The cat never does receive a bell – and the story ends poorly for the mice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In many ways, that fable describes mankind’s reaction to the threats posed by climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.92,0)">Already in 1986, the front cover of Der Spiegel showed Cologne cathedral half-submerged by water and the headline declared a “Climate Catastrophe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This is just one example, among many, that demonstrates that people were aware of the risks posed by climate change a generation ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.3,0)">Yet, while many people agreed on the seriousness of the issue, and that something had to be done, concrete action has been much less prevalent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is with this history in mind that I want to talk about the role of central banks in addressing climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.38,0)">Clearly, central banks are not the main actors when it comes to preventing global heating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.62,0)">Central banks are not responsible for climate policy and the most important tools that are needed lie outside of our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But the fact that we are not in the driving seat does not mean that we can simply ignore climate change, or that we do not play a role in combating it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.54,0)">Just as with the mice in the fable, inaction has negative consequences, and the implications of not tackling climate change are already visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Globally, the past six years are the warmest six on record, and 2020 was the warmest in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.49,0)">The number of disasters caused by natural hazards is also rising, resulting in $210 billion of damages in 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.05,0)">An analysis of over 300 peer-reviewed studies of disasters found that almost 70% of the events analysed were made more likely, or more severe, by human-caused climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">That said, there are now signs that policy action to fight climate change is accelerating, especially in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We are seeing a new political willingness among regulators and fiscal authorities to speed up the transition to a carbon neutral economy, on the back of substantial technological advances in the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">This increased action is often considered as a source of transition risk, which we need to take into account and reflect in our policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This is not “mission creep”, it is simply acknowledging reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Yet the transition to carbon neutral is not so much a risk as an opportunity for the world to avoid the far more disruptive outcome that would eventually result from governmental and societal inaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Scenarios show that the economic and financial risks of an orderly transition can be contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Even a disorderly scenario, where the economic and financial impacts are potentially substantial, represents a much better overall outcome in the long run than the disastrous impact of the transition not occurring at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">It now seems likely that faster progress will be made along three interlocking dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.14,0)">Each of them lies outside the remit of central banks, but will have important implications for central bank balance sheets and policy objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Including, informing and innovating The first dimension along which we expect rapid progress is including the true social and environmental cost of carbon into the prices paid by all sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Appropriate pricing can come via direct carbon taxes or through comprehensive cap and trade schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Both are used to some extent in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It is likely, though, that the next steps in Europe will come mainly via the EU’s Emissions Trading System  , a cap and trade scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The ETS is an essential infrastructure, although it has not always been successful in the past at delivering a predictable price of carbon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Moreover, it currently covers only around half of EU greenhouse gas emissions and a significant amount of allowances continue to be given for free.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The effective price of carbon is expected to rise if the EU’s targets for reducing emissions are to be reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Modelling by the OECD and the European Commission  suggests that an effective carbon price between €40-60  is currently needed, depending on how stringent other regulations are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The introduction of the ETS Market Stability Reserve and the review of the ETS scheduled for this year should provide the opportunity to deliver a clear path towards adequate carbon pricing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">The second dimension where we expect to see progress is greater information on the exposure of individual companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.47,0)">At present, information on the sustainability of financial products – when available – is inconsistent, largely incomparable and at times unreliable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.24,0)">That means that climate risks are not adequately priced,  and there is a substantial risk of sharp future corrections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Yet for an open market economy to allocate resources efficiently, the pricing mechanism needs to work correctly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This requires a step change in the disclosure of climate-related data using standardised and commonly agreed definitions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">While TCFD-based  disclosures have underpinned public/private efforts to better inform, disclosure needs to be at a far more granular level of detail than is currently available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.9,0)">climate disclosures are governed by the Non-Financial Reporting Directive  , which is currently under review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The Eurosystem has advocated for mandatory disclosures of climate-related risks from a far greater number of companies, including non-listed entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Moreover, disclosures should be complemented by forward-looking measures that assess the extent to which both financial and non-financial firms are aligned with climate goals and net zero commitments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">The European Taxonomy Regulation  that entered into force last year is also an important milestone along this path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">But it still needs to be fleshed out with concrete technical criteria and complemented by an equivalent taxonomy for carbon-intensive activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">A further essential step is the consistent and transparent inclusion of climate risks in credit ratings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Here, again, we have high hopes that progress will now speed up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">While adequate carbon prices and greater information on exposures will help provide incentives to decarbonise, that economic transformation cannot take place without the third dimension: substantial green innovation and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Both, however, require a complex ecosystem of which finance is a key element,  so we expect to see increasing availability of green finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Green bond issuance by euro area residents has grown sevenfold since 2015, reaching €75 billion in 2020 – this represents roughly 4% of the total corporate bond issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We need to see funding for green innovation increasing from other market segments as well, especially as recent analyses point to the beneficial role of equity investors in supporting the green transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Assets under management by investment funds with environmental, social and governance mandates have roughly tripled since 2015, and a little more than half of these funds are domiciled in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Completing the capital markets union should provide a further push to support equity-based green finance by fostering deep and liquid capital markets across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Simultaneous progress along each of these three dimensions increases the likelihood of substantial economic change in the near term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">That is so because movement along each dimension reinforces progress along the others and magnifies the effectiveness of climate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">For example, the economic impact of higher carbon prices depends on the availability of alternative green technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.52,0)">In the past, a sudden and substantial increase in carbon taxes could have resulted in an economic downturn, substantial stranded assets and threats to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Today, however, solar power is not only consistently cheaper than new coal or gas-fired plants in most countries, but it also offers some of the lowest cost electricity ever seen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Green finance and innovation are also developing rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Introducing well-signalled carbon pricing therefore becomes more feasible and could further sharpen incentives both to develop new technologies and to carry out the substantial investment required for the widespread adoption of the green technologies that already exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Climate change and central banks Today, then, central banks face two trends – more visible impacts of climate change and an acceleration of policy transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.07,0)">Both trends have macroeconomic and financial implications and have consequences for our primary objective of price stability,  for our other areas of competence including financial stability and banking supervision, as well as for the Eurosystem’s own balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Central banks are both aware of those consequences, and determined to mitigate them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Much has already been accomplished and more is under way: The founding of the Network for Greening the Financial System  , with membership including all major central banks, is testament to that collective engagement with climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">At the ECB, we are now launching a new climate change centre to bring together more efficiently the different expertise and strands of work on climate across the Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.62,0)">Climate change affects all of our policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">The climate change centre provides the structure we need to tackle the issue with the urgency and determination that it deserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In the area of financial stability and banking supervision, the ECB has taken concrete steps towards expanding the financial system’s understanding of climate risks and its ability to manage them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We have issued a guide on our supervisory expectations relating to the management and disclosure of climate-related and environmental risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">A recent survey of the climate-related disclosures of 125 banks suggests there is still a way to go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It evaluated climate disclosures across several basic information categories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.74,0)">Only 3% of banks made disclosures in every category, and 16% made no disclosure in any category.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">ECB Banking Supervision has requested that banks conduct a climate risk self-assessment and draw up action plans, which we will begin assessing this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We will conduct a bank-level climate stress test in 2022.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The ECB is also currently carrying out a climate risk stress test exercise to assess the impact on the European banking sector over a 30-year horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.12,0)">Preliminary results from mapping climate patterns to the address-level location of firms’ physical assets show that in the absence of a transition, physical risks in Europe are concentrated unevenly across countries and sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.04,0)">But there is more: climate change also impacts our primary mandate of price stability through several channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This is why climate change considerations form an integral part of our ongoing review of our monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.3,0)">Climate change can create short-term volatility in output and inflation through extreme weather events,  and if left unaddressed can have long-lasting effects on growth and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.12,0)">Transition policies and innovation can also have a significant impact on growth and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.2,0)">These factors could potentially cause a durable divergence between headline and core measures of inflation and influence the inflation expectations of households and businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.38,0)">The transmission of monetary policy through to the interest rates faced by households and businesses could also be impaired, to the extent that increased physical risks or the transition generate stranded assets and losses by financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.11,0)">According to a recent estimate by the European Systemic Risk Board, a disorderly transition could reduce lending to the private sector by 5% in real terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.83,0)">And climate change can also have implications for our monetary policy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">First, the Eurosystem’s balance sheet itself is exposed to climate risks, through the securities purchased in the asset purchase programmes and the collateral provided by counterparties as part of our policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.16,0)">Furthermore, several factors associated with climate change may weigh on productivity and the equilibrium interest rate, potentially reducing the space available for conventional policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.75,0)">For example, labour supply and productivity may diminish as a result of heat stress, temporary incapability to work and higher rates of mortality and morbidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.41,0)">Resources may be reallocated away from productive use to support adaptation, while capital accumulation may be impaired by rising destruction from natural hazards and weaker investment dynamics related to rising uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.85,0)">And the increase in short-term volatility and accelerated structural change could hamper central banks’ ability to correctly identify the shocks that are relevant for the medium-term inflation outlook, making it more difficult to assess the appropriate monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Our strategy review enables us to consider more deeply how we can continue to protect our mandate in the face of these risks and, at the same time, strengthen the resilience of monetary policy and our balance sheet to climate risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">That naturally involves evaluating the feasibility, efficiency and effectiveness of available options, and ensuring they are consistent with our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The ECB is also assessing carefully, without prejudice to the primary objective of price stability, how it can contribute to supporting the EU’s economic policies, as required by the treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Europe has prioritised combating climate change and put in place targets, policies and regulations to underpin the transition to a carbon-neutral economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">While the Eurosystem is not a policy maker in these areas, it should assess its potential role in the transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">We recognise that our active role in some markets can influence the development of certain market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The ECB currently holds around a fifth of the outstanding volume of eligible green bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Standardisation helps nascent markets gain liquidity and encourages growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">And our eligibility criteria can provide, in this context, a useful coordination device.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">For example, since the start of this year, bonds with coupon structures linked to certain sustainability performance targets have been eligible as collateral for Eurosystem credit operations and for outright purchases for monetary policy purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">We have also taken action with regards to our non-monetary policy portfolio, namely our own funds and pension fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The ECB raised the share of green bonds in its own funds portfolio to 3.5% last year and is planning on raising it further as this market is expected to grow in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Investing parts of the own funds portfolio in the green bond fund of the Bank for International Settlements marks another step in this direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.63,0)">A shift of all conventional equity benchmark indices tracked by the staff pension fund to low-carbon equivalents last year significantly reduced the carbon footprint of the equity funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Other central banks are also aligning decisively their investment decisions with sustainability criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Climate change is one of the greatest challenges faced by mankind this century, and there is now broad agreement that we should act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">But that agreement needs to be translated more urgently into concrete measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">The ECB will contribute to this effort within its mandate, acting in tandem with those responsible for climate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Unlike the mice in the fable, not only do we have to recognise that we cannot keep waiting for someone else to act, we also must recognise that the burden cannot fall on one party alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">There is no single panacea for climate change, and combating it requires rapid progress along several dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.94,0)">Relying on just one solution, or on one party, will not be enough to avoid a climate catastrophe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And here we can actually learn something from mice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.69,0)">As the Roman playwright Plautus wrote, “How wise a beast is the little mouse, who never entrusts its safety to only one hole.”  Also known as the Council of Mice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Der Spiegel  , 11
