    <h1> Hearing before the  Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament </h1>
    <h2> Introductory statement delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Brussels, 20 June 2000 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> Hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Brussels, 20 June 2000 With the transcript of the questions and answers Once more it is my pleasure to appear before your Committee in order to report on the recent monetary policy decisions taken by the ECB and on the reasoning underlying these decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To this end, I shall also present the ECB's analysis of current economic developments and comment briefly on the outlook for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I should also like to add a few words on the change in the procedures for the allotment of liquidity in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem, beginning with the operation to be settled on 28 June 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Moreover, I should like to inform you of other important decisions taken by the ECB, particularly in the area of transparency, which is an issue that has frequently been raised in the framework of our regular dialogue, and to which the ECB attaches great importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Current economic developments and prospects Over the past few months both pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem have indicated that upward risks to price stability have increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The developments in monetary and credit aggregates over the first few months of 2000 clearly indicated that liquidity conditions in the euro area were generous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3   was 6.3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This followed an increase of 5.9% in the period from January to March 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">There has, therefore, been a further deviation of M3 growth from the reference value of 4 1/2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Annual M3 growth, as measured by the three-month moving average, has been almost 1 1/2 percentage points above the reference value since the end of the summer of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It was almost two percentage points above the reference value in April 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Growth of credit to the private sector, which was already high throughout 1999, increased during the first four months of 2000, reaching, on an annual basis, 11.4% in April 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Developments in the first pillar thus indicated that upward risks to price stability had increased over the past few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">They needed to be counteracted in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Looking at the information provided under the second pillar, the outlook for growth in the euro area has improved further since our last meeting in March, while upward risks to consumer price inflation have continued to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">There is widespread consensus among the forecasts from major international organisations and private institutions that real GDP growth will exceed 3% this year and next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This is significantly higher than projected at the end of last year or earlier this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">On the domestic side, this positive outlook reflects expectations that growth in domestic demand will benefit, in particular, from ongoing employment growth and higher rates of capacity utilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">On the external side, the upturn of growth in the world economy appears to be more robust and broadly based than was anticipated earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This suggests that the growth of euro area exports should remain strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Information from recently released short-term indicators, such as the surveys of the European Commission on consumer and industrial confidence, largely confirm these forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">They indicate continued strong growth in the first half of 2000, following the upturn in real GDP growth in the second half of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">With regard to consumer price developments, inflation has recently risen above the level expected by most forecasters at the end of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">At the same time, according to currently available forecasts, consumer price inflation will exceed, this year and next year, the levels forecast at the end of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.34,0)">The level and the pattern of overall HICP inflation observed over the past few months largely reflect the impact of oil price developments on the energy component of the HICP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.67,0)">In March, annual headline inflation was 2.1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.12,0)">While it came down to 1.9% in April and May, the rise in oil prices in May 2000 points to renewed short-term upward pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">It should also be considered that, in the context of the favourable prospects for strong economic growth in the euro area, the pass-through of exchange rate changes via import prices is normally facilitated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Overall, for these reasons, HICP inflation is not expected to fall significantly in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.69,0)">In the context of robust economic growth, these short-term upward pressures were considered to potentially increase the risks of second-round effects, implying that they could have longer-lasting effects on consumer price inflation, if monetary policy did not counteract these in a timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Therefore, in response to these upward risks to price stability, as they emerged from the analysis under both pillars of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem, the Governing Council of the ECB decided to increase ECB interest rates by 25 basis points on 27 April 2000, and by 50 basis points on 8 June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">The rate on the main refinancing operations has thus reached 4.25%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The rates on the marginal lending facility and on the deposit facilities have now been set at 5.25% and 3.25% respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The Governing Council also decided on 8 June to switch to a new tender procedure for the allotment of liquidity in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.75,0)">I will discuss this issue later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB reflected the forward-looking character of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.44,0)">I should like to stress that the decisions of the Eurosystem should be interpreted as responses to risks to price stability in the medium term before they materialise, rather than as reactions to a situation whereby price stability has already been jeopardised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">In this respect, the recent increases in ECB rates have been motivated by a desire to avoid being compelled to take stronger measures at a later stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">I believe this is the best way to fulfil our mandate, as it is defined by the Treaty, and thereby to contribute to sustained economic growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.09,0)">The sounder the growth process is, the longer will it normally last.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The sounder the growth process is, the more permanent and sustained will the creation of new jobs tend to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">An important question in this context relates to the sustainability of the expansion of economic activity at current growth rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.11,0)">The answer to this question has important implications for our assessment of the monetary policy stance, as it potentially affects the interpretation of some of the analysis conducted under both pillars of the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">At our last meeting in March, I already addressed the issue of the reference value for monetary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.83,0)">This reference value is compiled from the estimated trend growth of real GDP, the estimated trend decline in the velocity of circulation of M3 and the quantitative definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.23,0)">In the light of the prospects for strong economic growth and upside risks to price stability which I have already mentioned, the question has been raised as to whether these developments would require a revision of the reference value for monetary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.82,0)">In this context, I should like to recall the Governing Council's decision to review the reference value on an annual basis, and that the next review will take place in December 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I should also like to emphasise that the reference value is a medium-term concept and does not constitute a monetary target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.99,0)">What we aim to capture by trend growth is the rate of growth, which is sustainable in the medium term, which, according to our analysis, has been estimated as falling in the range of 2-2 1/2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me also emphasise the fact that estimates of potential output   are surrounded by considerable uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Therefore, these indicators should be treated with great caution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">We are currently observing a strong cyclical expansion supported by strong productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">However, we need more compelling evidence before it can be concluded that this upturn will be followed by higher growth potential, which is above trend growth, as it has been estimated so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is too early to tell, but we are monitoring and analysing developments closely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We will take our findings into account when reviewing the reference value and taking monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Nevertheless, I should like to stress that it is hard to imagine that the current growth in M3 could be justified by an upward revision of potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I should also like to point out that the analysis of monetary and credit developments conducted under the first pillar of our strategy is more complex than simply comparing actual M3 growth with the reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The challenge to turn the current expansion into a prolonged period of non-inflationary growth clearly requires further efforts in all policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Reforms in the labour market will be a major factor contributing to sustained non-inflationary growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.19,0)">The current level of unemployment in the euro area, despite some decline, is still too high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">In this respect, both appropriate wage settlements and structural reforms will be important contributions to continued employment growth and to maintaining low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">With a view to fiscal policies in the euro area, it is important that the opportunity of the current economic environment is seized to improve the soundness of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Member States should take advantage of the current cyclical position in order to achieve and maintain budgetary positions, which meet the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">More ambitious fiscal positions than those targeted in Member States' updated stability programmes should be achieved, particularly in countries with high debt ratios and especially if economic growth develops more favourably than expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In addition, we welcome initiatives to implement tax cuts in a number of countries, provided that these measures are consistent with the progress to be achieved in the area of fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">At the same time, more emphasis should be placed on structural reforms on the expenditure side of budgets leading to stricter expenditure restraint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">At the current juncture, a pro-cyclical bias in fiscal policies should be avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.08,0)">Let me now turn to the decision of the Governing Council to modify the procedure for the allotment of liquidity in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This change was motivated by purely technical reasons, namely by the need to address the problem of overbidding, which has become increasingly severe in the course of recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.9,0)">As a matter of fact, since early 2000, the bids submitted in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem have been following a steady upward trend, leading ultimately to allotment ratios of less than 1% of the bids.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">For this reason, we decided that the main refinancing operations would be conducted as variable rate tenders using the multiple rate auction procedure, beginning with the operation to be conducted in one week from now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Contrary to the fixed rate tender procedure, whereby the counterparties of the Eurosystem submit bids for a specified amount of liquidity, the new procedure implies that the counterparties will also indicate in their bids the interest rate they are prepared to pay for the requested amount of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This should eliminate the incentive to overbid, for in the new format of the auction the bidding behaviour of counterparties should be constrained by interest rate cost considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.1,0)">I should like to stress that the switch to variable rate tenders is in no way intended to further modify the stance of the monetary policy of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In order to underline this intention, and to be able to continue to send a clear signal concerning the monetary policy stance, we decided to introduce a minimum bid rate, below which no valid bid may be submitted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This rate will signal the monetary policy stance of the Eurosystem, and thereby assume the role that has, so far, been performed by the main refinancing rate in the fixed rate tender procedure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Other activities of the Eurosystem Turning now to other activities of the Eurosystem, I should like to begin by informing you of further steps which have been initiated by the ECB in the area of its communications policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In line with the ECB's principle to be as open as possible in the framework of its responsibilities as a central bank, and in order to enhance the transparency of its regulatory framework, the ECB has decided to make available to the general public, as a rule, the ECB legal instruments governing the relationship between the ECB and the national central banks   of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So far, the publication of such documents has been decided by the Governing Council on a case-by-case basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Obviously, it is indispensable to exclude from this general rule all sensitive information that needs to be kept confidential in order to protect the public and economic interests underlying the activities of the Eurosystem, in particular with a view to monetary and exchange rate stability, the fight against counterfeiting and the legal protection of banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.59,0)">Thus, confidentiality has to be maintained whenever the disclosure of such information could have significantly adverse effects on the activities of the Eurosystem or could seriously prejudice the effective conduct of its operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">All non-confidential legal instruments of the ECB will be published both in the Official Journal of the European Communities and in the Compendium of the ECB, which is also accessible via the ECB Internet website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">At the current stage, the Governing Council has approved the publication of three Guidelines addressed to the NCBs of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.88,0)">They concern the authorisation to issue national banknotes during the transitional period, the exchange of banknotes in Community currencies according to Article 52 of the Statute of the European System of Central Banks and of the European Central Bank and the protection of confidentiality of individual statistical information collected by the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The publication of several other documents adopted by the ECB is currently under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me now briefly refer to two reports relating to the Eurosystem's tasks in the area of prudential supervision and financial stability, which have recently been released to the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Both reports were prepared by the Banking Supervision Committee of the European System of Central Banks  , which comprises high-ranking representatives of the central banks and banking supervisory authorities of the 15 EU Member States and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.17,0)">The report on "Asset prices and banking stability" analyses the possible implications for the EU banking sector in the event of a significant fall in asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.82,0)">Given the difficulties and uncertainties in measuring the "fundamental" value of an asset and the generally inconclusive results provided by the various asset price valuation models, the report does not endeavour to determine the "appropriateness" of asset price levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.81,0)">Rather, its main objective is to assess the resilience of the EU banking sector to possible downward developments in asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The report concludes that stock market exposures of EU banks do not currently give any rise to concern from a macro-prudential point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.45,0)">The EU banking sector would not face major difficulties in the case of a sharp decline of stock prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.01,0)">However, problems for EU banks could arise if a fall in stock prices entails second-round effects such as a significant slowdown in economic growth leading to a further recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.44,0)">Moreover, there appear to be some potential risks to EU banks as a result of a possible price fall in the real estate sector, but no major threat to systemic stability could be identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The report also addresses the policies pursued by the supervisory authorities in Member States in order to preserve financial stability and to ensure prudent lending practices by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The actions taken in the various Member States range from public communications of concerns to specific regulatory measures, such as changes in risk provisioning and/or asset valuation rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Given the interest of the Eurosystem in these kind of issues, the Governing Council has given the Banking Supervision Committee of the ESCB a mandate to undertake periodic reviews of asset price developments from the point of view of banking stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.72,0)">The second report that I should like to bring to your attention examines the question of the extent to which factors such as technological change, financial liberalisation and internationalisation and the increasing trend towards banking disintermediation have had an impact on the activities and, consequently, on the income structure of EU banks in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">The most noteworthy change that has occurred in the income structure of EU banks is the increasing importance of non-interest income, comprising, inter alia, fees and commissions, net profit on financial operations and income from variable yield securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This trend may have had a positive effect on the overall profitability of banks in recent years, even though banks were also confronted with increased costs associated with the development of non-interest income activities, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">in order to attract and retain highly qualified personnel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">The report also indicates that the shift towards non-interest income does not necessarily induce greater volatility in the income of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.52,0)">The changes that have occurred within the income structures of banks, have also had an impact on the risk profiles of credit institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Indeed, some categories of risks, including operational and strategic risks, have become more significant compared with the risks associated with classical intermediation activities of banks, such as credit risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Therefore, the findings of the report seem to support suggestions for determining specific capital requirements for risks other than credit risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Such measures are currently under discussion in the relevant institutional fora, in the context of the review of the capital adequacy regime for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I shall now be happy to answer any questions you may have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Chair: Thank you very much President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I am sure there will be plenty of questions and I will give the floor straight away to Mr Von Wogau.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I would like to remind you that we have chosen a procedure according to which the groups ask a question in order, and so it's the EPP, the biggest group, that kicks off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Mr Von Wogau: Thank you very much Madam Chairman.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.32,0)">President, first of all I would like to point out that with the most recent interest rate decisions you have departed from your preceding practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Instead of taking very small steps to increase interest rates, you have taken a decision for 50 basis points, and that's a very clear signal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">I would like to say on behalf of my group that I very much welcome this strong step, and the positive consequences can already be seen in exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This shows that the confidence of the markets in the long-term stability of the euro has been enhanced by this vigorous decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But, I would like to put a question to you, since the ECB has been active, it has followed a policy which has been decidedly different from the policy of the Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First of all, you followed an interest rate policy which strongly departs from the policy of the US which I think has helped the development of the exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">With the interest rate, there was a fairly big difference in interest rates and that has encouraged investors to invest in the US rather than in Europe because of this interest rate differential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">But now you have sent out a clear message on stability, because the inflation rate has reached 2.0% whereas in the US there is tranquillity about the fact that now the inflation rate is fixed above 3.0%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">So I would like to put a very clear question to you - I would like to know why you believe that your strategy in the long-term is better than the strategy of Mr Greenspan?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg: I don't know whether it is better, but the circumstances of course in, which both economic areas find themselves, are totally different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.09,0)">In the US, the problem is how to achieve a 'soft-landing' from periods of over-extension and from more than normal economic growth over a number of years and how to engineer to get back to normal circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In Europe, monetary policy has to support the resumption of sustained, long-term economic growth from a period where economic performance has been sub-optimal in 1998 and first half of 1999, to mention only the most recent period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Now the policies are different, admittedly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.15,0)">I want to point out in the first place that the level of interest rates about which we talk in Europe is still significantly lower than it is in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Then you ask: why this increase of 50 base points suddenly, which you applaud, and I am grateful for that, and not continue with the increases of rates in small steps?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">First of all, there are signs that the risks to inflation are becoming stronger all the time and they have been confirmed by the release of the latest figures in the course of May.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">I refer to the monetary data and the increase in oil prices which has resumed in the course of May.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">This justified a bigger than usual step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I will also not deny that there is also a psychological argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">We were quite convinced that if we had moved by only one quarter percentage point again, then immediately market expectations would have arisen that this was only a step in a series and that further rises could be imminent, even in the short run, and that is what we wanted to avoid at all costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We wanted quiet, and for a considerable period to come, we don't know how long, but we wanted quiet and predictability for the coming months in the monetary field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">That is the other major reason why we decided to increase rates by 50 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">One additional advantage, I certainly will not deny that, even though it was not our aim, one additional advantage is that it does seem to have somewhat diminished the significant interest rate differential which existed between the two large economic areas  , which is a welcome development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Chair: Would you like to ask a supplementary Mr Von Wogau?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Mr Von Wogau: Yes, I would like to come back to the second part of my question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The fact that you have put up interest rates now could in the medium-term signify that we'll actually have to renounce a certain amount of growth, because that will have a braking effect on our economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Here obviously, your strategy is based on the constitution of the ECB, and your strategy is different from that of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the United States, the inflation rate of more than 3% seems to be permitted whereas you decided to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.86,0)">Now, leaving aside the institutional question and the fixing of interest rates just decided by the ECB, I would like to know what the disadvantage of a strategy would be which, regarding the inflation rate, would be more lax as regards the inflation rate than the strategy you are following?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg: We are convinced that raising interest rates to the level that we have done, now the main interest rates are at 4 1/4%, in no way will frustrate the prospects for robust economic growth over the 2 years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">I want to point out that, without associating myself entirely with it, that the OECD for example has forecast that growth in the euro area will be well in excess of 3% both in 2000 and 2001, but they also say that interest rates will have to rise to the 5% level in that same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Now, without associating myself with that, it demonstrates that sustained growth is possible and even likely with interest rates significantly higher than they are at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">I also want to point to the American experience, where we have seen a period of prolonged economic growth, it seems clearly above the long term potential of the American economy, with interest rates 100, 200, sometimes 300, basis points higher than prevailing in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">So, the interest elasticity of economic growth, as you may call it, is not as large as sometimes may have been feared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Now the second part of your question, if you could help me?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Mr Von Wogau: What would be the advantage or what would be the disadvantage that you would see were we to allow a higher inflation rate as is now the case in the United States?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg: It is clear we have a mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Our main mandate is to preserve price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.91,0)">Now what is price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We have chosen our own definition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Price stability will be preserved if the annual rate of HICP inflation is below the limit of 2%, thereby reckoning that the measurement bias which may be included in the price measurement will not exceed 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">And so we are satisfied as long as future inflation remains below 2%, and we are convinced at the moment and with this monetary policy stance that ceteribus paribus we are fulfilling that condition, that the monetary policy stance which we have now chosen is appropriate for that outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.39,0)">Now, if you were to relax the definition, to my mind, that would be a disaster, because it would give a signal to the public at large, and especially to the markets, that the ECB didn't care that much about inflation any longer, when it is our prime purpose to keep it below a certain level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.68,0)">It would immediately create inflationary expectations amongst the public if we were to relax that attitude, and inflationary expectations being raised would have the result of becoming self-fulfilling prophecies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.84,0)">So, it is something that I categorically am inclined to withstand and to deny and I will not co-operate in that respect.</span><span style="background-color:
