    <span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)"> 21 November 2019 Future-proofing the European banking market – removing the obstacles to exit Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the S&P Global’s European Financial Institutions Conference, Paris Consolidation seems to be something of a buzzword.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It is associated with discussions of the profitability of banks, with debates on overbanking or the optimal size of a banking area, and with issues of competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">From a prudential supervision perspective, I’m concerned about efficient market functioning and sound banking structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">And as a central banker, my goal is to maintain a smooth transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.74,0)">Facilitating bank failures Between 2008 and 2012, spurred by the crisis, we saw more than four times as many US banks fail than EU ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">That was not because European banks were healthier than their US peers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.8,0)">The fact that only a few European banks failed during the crisis was not proof of their resilience either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">It was proof of governments’ willingness to support ailing banks with taxpayers’ money: between 2008 and 2017, state aid granted to EU banks for their recapitalisation amounted to €1.5 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">That corresponds to around 10% of EU GDP in 2017, half of which was ultimately used to help ailing banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.49,0)">Governments feared systemic consequences if banks were to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.13,0)">After all, the collapse of Lehman Brothers had triggered the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.41,0)">Being afraid of something similar happening again is understandable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.55,0)">But bailing out banks is not the best response to such fears.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.05,0)">First, it perverts banks’ incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It means that any bank considered systemically relevant enjoys implicit, cost-free insurance – and the bar for systemic relevance was often not all that high in political terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.43,0)">Thus, such banks were prone to moral hazard; they were prone to taking on too much risk, which promised higher returns – and made failure more likely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.28,0)">Banks did not necessarily care though.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">They would reap the returns, while taxpayers had to bear the risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.57,0)">The political economy consequences of the bailouts are still being felt today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.38,0)">Second, bailing out banks prevents the non-viable ones from exiting the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.11,0)">Instead, they drag on and put pressure on margins for other banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.05,0)">The sector does not consolidate, profitability remains subdued, and that gives rise to new risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.43,0)">For one, weak banks might gamble on being rescued and take on even more risk; others might go in search of yield with the same result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.67,0)">Next, unprofitable banks lack the means to build up capital buffers, which renders them vulnerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.05,0)">And finally, banks may not be able to cover their fixed costs, which would depress investment in areas such as digitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Consequently, one of the goals of post-crisis reforms was to allow banks to fail again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">With this in mind, the Single Resolution Mechanism was set up in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This provides a framework under which banks can fail in an orderly and well-managed manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">This was certainly a big step in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But was it big enough?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.87,0)">I would argue that we still do not have a truly European approach for handling troubled banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Even though we have a European resolution mechanism, much of the action still takes place at the national level – with all the differences that entails.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.35,0)">Since it was entrusted with banking supervision, the ECB has only declared very few institutions “failing or likely to fail”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.9,0)">And only one of those was resolved by the Single Resolution Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.9,0)">The others were liquidated under national insolvency regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.01,0)">The Single Resolution Board decides whether it is in the public interest to resolve a bank that is deemed failing or likely to fail, or whether the bank in question should be liquidated instead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">If the bank is to be resolved, this is done in accordance with the framework laid out in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, the BRRD.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But that framework depends on how the home country of the bank in question has transposed the BRRD into national law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.72,0)">And such transposition differs from country to country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.33,0)">If the bank in question is to be liquidated, this is done at the national level, according to national laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.18,0)">And national laws differ a lot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.95,0)">National insolvency and bankruptcy laws are a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I won’t deny that there are valid reasons for those differences: legislating for insolvency and bankruptcy deeply reflects the social contract of Member States in their cultural and historic diversity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">When it comes to the liquidation of banks that are part of a banking union, a more harmonised approach to liquidation would be appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Legislators are now considering whether to add a liquidation tool to the European banking toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Such an administrative liquidation framework would foster a more European approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Furthermore, improvements to the crisis management framework would help a banking union reach its full potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This might include harmonising the creditor hierarchy, introducing a general depositor preference and removing the overlap between supervisory and early intervention measures from the relevant European legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.54,0)">Facilitating bank M&A Outright failures are one way for non-viable banks to exit the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Mergers and acquisitions provide a second option.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.32,0)">Nonetheless, we are seeing very little consolidation – either within, or even less so, across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">There are several reasons for that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.15,0)">Uncertainty plays an important role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.77,0)">For a long time, the fear of a euro area break-up kept banks from engaging in cross-border adventures despite the long recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">This fear should have receded in the same way that regulatory uncertainty has.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.01,0)">But there are also other sources of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.63,0)">Digitalisation, for instance, puts a question mark over the value of large branch networks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the future, scale might become less of an issue for physical distribution capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.34,0)">And then there is uncertainty about bank valuations, which are low across the board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.23,0)">Potential M&A targets might not want to sell at what they consider a rock-bottom price; at the same time, potential bidders might lack confidence because of their own low valuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In general, many banks still focus on deleveraging and cleaning up their balance sheets as a prerequisite to focusing on growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.25,0)">This illustrates that consolidation cannot be the panacea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Merging two weak banks will not magically produce one strong bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Likewise, when a bank that is in good shape takes over a weaker one, this may not necessarily result in a strong institution, but could actually lead to a larger, less healthy bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.06,0)">Structural inefficiencies are best dealt with at the level of the institution in which they originate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.67,0)">We should not expect them to simply evaporate in the course of a merger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.07,0)">But obstacles to consolidation stem from more than just divergence in national insolvency and tax laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I have also heard questions regarding the implementation of existing regulations, such as capital treatment of liquidity waivers, the application of the new discretion on GSIB methodology, the impact of NPL disposals on internal model parameters, and the interaction with resolution strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The transposition of EU laws into national laws has also provided loopholes allowing preferential treatment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Many countries protect their domestic banking markets by ring-fencing capital and liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.31,0)">Unresolved home/host issues may discourage cross-border M&A activity, because they prevent banks from freely allocating capital and liquidity across the entire banking group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.7,0)">While a European Deposit Insurance Scheme might reduce the incentives for governments to restrict the free flow of capital and liquidity,  host countries argue in favour of preventing healthy institutions in one country from “bleeding out” to unhealthy parts of a group in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.31,0)">Furthermore, decision-makers might want to keep banking services in their country for consumers whom they don’t want to see losing access to such services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">We could try to alleviate such concerns through group-wide guarantees which take into account such concerns to avoid misalignments between financing and decision-making across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">If contractual arrangements are not considered sufficient, maybe publicly endorsed standardised templates on the triggering and functioning of waivers, and information-sharing could bring us closer to a fully functioning European banking market that would also benefit consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Some argue the ECB should look much closer to home for unwarranted obstacles to consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I would not exclude to revisit our assessment criteria, also about the treatment of NPLs in M&A.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.47,0)">And what about the capital we require merged entities to hold?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Do our requirements appropriately reflect the synergies reaped by mergers?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">As a supervisor, we step up our scrutiny of merged entities, at least at the start of their life, as we recognise the operational risk challenges posed by merging complex structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.15,0)">That should not lead to double-counting, though.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To go as far as to allow for a temporary reduction of post merger capital levels would however need robust arguments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.89,0)">Our risk-aversion is not meant to block market-driven consolidation initiatives – and should not be understood as such.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, By reaping synergies, consolidation may help banks to address one of their most pressing challenges: how to reduce costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">That does not mean though that consolidation is the answer to everything.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.36,0)">And it might not always be in the consumer interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.75,0)">As a supervisor, we take a neutral stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We assess merger and acquisition proposals solely on technical grounds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.47,0)">It is for markets to decide whether or not consolidation takes place, and to what extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Market forces should, however, not be undermined by unnecessary obstacles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">While it is up to individual banks to futureproof themselves, policymakers and legislators can provide the right conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Seven years after the banking union was first proposed, it is about time for a single European banking market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">, “Europe: a work in progress – political integration and economic convergence in Monetary Union”.</span>
