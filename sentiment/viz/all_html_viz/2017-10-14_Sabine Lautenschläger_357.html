    <span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)"> Is small beautiful?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Supervision, regulation and the size of banks Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at an IMF seminar, Washington D.C., 14 October 2017 The call for greater proportionality in banking regulation and supervision is growing louder – not just in the United States and Europe, but also globally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.11,0)">To put it bluntly, proportionality involves applying a different set of rules to banks operating in the same market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Careful consideration must therefore be given to the various objectives pursued, and the costs and benefits involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">On the one hand, this means that we need to assess the financial stability risks posed by individual banks and groups of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And we need to look at the implications of proportionality for local competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">On the other hand, we have to consider the costs of regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.68,0)">Small banks face greater difficulties in complying with complex regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.11,0)">This may put them at a disadvantage and therefore reduce diversity in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">However, a wide diversity of small and medium-sized banks makes the banking sector more stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Thus proportionality may be necessary to foster such diversity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.64,0)">These are the kind of trade-offs we need to talk about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But let me begin by talking about risks, as this is the starting point for regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.21,0)">It can generally be assumed that the failure of a small bank poses a smaller risk to the financial system than the failure of a big bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">So it might make sense to apply a different regulatory and supervisory regime to small individual banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">However, when many small banks with the same business model form mutual liability arrangements via institutional protection schemes, qualified holdings or integrated cooperative structures, they might become systemically relevant – at least at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.59,0)">In the event of a failure, all these small banks taken together could pose a big risk to the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.32,0)">This is known as the “too many to fail” problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">It deserves particular attention – and probably a response that goes beyond the standard microprudential supervision that we are here to talk about today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">As small banks are generally less risky, the costs and benefits of regulation and supervision may not be balanced for small banks in some areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Applying to small banks the same approach that is applied to large banks would not be proportionate, as the costs, in particular of complex prudential rules, would be higher in comparison and the benefits would be smaller.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">So there is a strong case for proportionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Looking at the European situation, the EU’s single rulebook already provides for such proportionality in many cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.98,0)">For instance, reporting requirements for small banks are far less stringent than those for large banks: small banks have to report about 600 data points to supervisors, whereas larger banks have to report more than 40,000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The question is whether more proportionality in banking regulation is needed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Indeed, the discussion in Europe is currently focusing on changes in several additional areas which will enable banks to apply simpler rules and thus reduce compliance costs for smaller banks: One proposal focuses on the capital requirement rules for market and counterparty credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.57,0)">Banks with small trading books below €50 million could be exempted from the obligation to have a prudential trading book.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This would enable them to use the simpler credit risk framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Banks with trading books below €300 million could use a simpler standardised approach to calculate market risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Similarly, in the field of counterparty credit risk, banks with small derivative portfolios might be able to use a simpler standardised approach to calculate capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Another proposal looks at reducing the regulatory burden of small banks by softening reporting requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Some of the proposals discussed involve reducing the number of data points to be reported by using simplified templates and less granular data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.46,0)">Less convincing are proposals which involve less frequent reporting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">This would not result in cost savings, as banks would still have to invest in setting up reporting structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.63,0)">But it would mean that supervisors would have to work with outdated information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There are also suggestions to reduce the disclosure obligations for small banks, in particular non-listed ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">This would significantly reduce their administrative burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And there are proposals to exempt smaller banks from some remuneration rules – something that is worth discussing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">A great many proposals have been put forward altogether – I will refrain from listing them all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The critical question is: what do we want to achieve through the proportional regulation and supervision of small banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.53,0)">Would it mean that these banks could hold less capital, less liquidity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In my opinion, proportionality means simpler rules for smaller banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.33,0)">But it does not mean that the rules should be generally less stringent, or that banks can hold less capital or liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Finally, a crucial issue is where to draw the line between small and large banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.23,0)">Depending on the objectives of proportionality, the line might be drawn according to the volume of total assets; or it could be linked to the size of specific business activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.13,0)">It might also depend on banks’ business models or on whether or not banks use internal models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And the size of a bank relative to the country’s total banking assets could also play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Both quantitative and qualitative criteria need to be assessed when considering where to draw the line between small and large banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">To sum up, small banks are generally less risky than larger ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">So a proportionate approach to regulating and supervising small banks is indeed appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">An approach that resulted in simpler rules for small banks could help to balance the costs and benefits involved – but it should not result in small banks holding far less capital, as they also need to remain resilient during an economic downturn in order to continuously provide credit to the economy.</span>
