    <h3> Speaker: Eugenio Domingo Solans </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)"> Parameters of the eurosystem's monetary policy Keynote address delivered by Eugenio Domingo Solans, Member of the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the European Central Bank at the British Businessmen's Club, Düsseldorf, 12 September 2000 Thank you for inviting me to attend this dinner at the British Businessmen's Club in Düsseldorf and for giving me the opportunity to address you as guest keynote speaker this evening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Quantitative definition of price stability I shall start by considering the main steps taken by the ECB in order to facilitate a better interpretation of its policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">First, the ECB approved a clear, specific and quantitative definition of its primary objective as set out in the Maastricht Treaty: price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy has to be borne in mind in order to interpret the ECB's decisions in the correct way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What the ECB does has to be interpreted in terms of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">If you do that, it will be much easier to understand the ECB's course of action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.51,0)">If you introduce other elements to interpret our decisions, you could be making a mistake.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I am now thinking, namely, of the possibility of interpreting our decisions in terms of exchange rate developments or economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.31,0)">There is no central bank in the world which does not care about the exchange rate of its currency and the ECB certainly does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There is no neglect whatsoever regarding the euro exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The same applies to economic growth, which is supported by our monetary policy in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty, which states that "without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Both exchange rate and economic growth matter and are taken into account in our monetary policy decisions, although not independently, that is to say, not as policy objectives, but as factors closely related to our primary objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">A two-pillar strategy The second main step taken by the ECB to facilitate a better interpretation of its policy decisions was to establish a clear strategy based on two pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I shall not describe it because I am sure you know our strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Let me just remind you that precisely the two variables to which I referred before - the euro exchange rate and the economic growth of the euro area - are two important elements in the second pillar of our strategy since their developments are used to assess the risks for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I am prepared to agree with you that our monetary policy strategy is not simple, but rather quite sophisticated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The simplicity or complexity of a monetary policy strategy is linked to the simplicity or complexity of the area in which the strategy is applied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And certainly the euro area is a large, diverse, and in some aspects even heterogeneous economic area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Above all, the euro area is a new economic area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.04,0)">For all these reasons, we could not afford not to have or, at least, not to develop an explicit monetary policy strategy, as others do, nor, could we afford not to comply with the strategy, as others have done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.38,0)">This explains why we have two pillars instead of one, why we have a "reference value" instead of an "intermediate target" for M3 in the first pillar and why many indicators are introduced in the second pillar without boiling down the information they provide to a single figure, and so on and so forth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Lack of activism In order to interpret the Eurosystem's monetary decisions, it is also important to consider a more subtle element which I call the monetary policy approach, that is to say, the way we conduct our monetary policy, the basic philosophy which characterises it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.21,0)">The main feature of the ECB's monetary policy approach is its lack of activism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.95,0)">This lack of activism implies that the ECB's monetary policy does not intend to be counter-cyclical, nor does it intend to react to short-term changes in its economic stance nor to fine-tune economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">On the contrary, the ECB's monetary policy intends to provide general monetary conditions with a medium-term perspective, valid for the whole geographical euro area and oriented towards the achievement of our primary objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">By doing so, we create the best monetary framework for a strong currency and also for economic growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Not being counter-cyclical does not imply that the ECB's monetary policy cannot help to smooth out economic cycles: indeedit can extend the wavelength of the economic waves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.21,0)">The ECB's monetary policy cannot actively fine-tune: neither in terms of time nor space.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Not being active in terms of space permits the ECB's monetary policy to meet the monetary requirements of the whole area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.73,0)">Furthermore, no monetary policy can discriminate its effects on a regional basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.73,0)">It would, therefore, be incorrect to interpret the ECB's monetary policy decisions in terms of the needs of a single country, or a few of them, instead of adopting a euro area-wide perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Not being active also permits an appropriate degree of interaction with other Community or national economic policies, as I shall explain later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.62,0)">Frame rather than action, chassis and shock absorber rather than an engine, fresh open air rather than an oxygen tank, traditional cooking rather than a microwave oven: these are the few metaphors I use to explain the lack of activism of the ECB's monetary policy compared with an active one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.11,0)">Lack of activism does not imply absence of gradualism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In order to achieve the proper monetary conditions it is not only possible, but sometimes it is even advisable, to move in gradual consistent steps, each of them taken in accordance with the new available information and following the renewed judgement of the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.54,0)">Lack of activism does not imply automatism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.35,0)">The ECB's monetary policy decisions do not follow a specific "rule", such as the Friedman or the Taylor rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Instead, we follow a strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Both rules and strategies rely on a basic economic model, which links the monetary policy objective with the development of some specific variables ultimately under the control of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But besides the mechanical economic relationships enshrined in the model, a strategy requires an additional important ingredient: judgement, that is to say, discretion, lack of automatism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In a new, complex and uncertain environment such as the euro area, who would prefer an automatic pilot to an experienced human pilot?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.28,0)">I, certainly, would not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Independence Instead of automatism as a way to avoid the inflationary bias of the policy-makers, the Eurosystem's solution is central banking independence, which, therefore, should be seen as a necessary condition to achieve its main goal: price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Through its inclusion in the Maastricht Treaty, the Eurosystem's independence has a solid constitutional basis reflecting the will of the European people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Independence implies a variety of aspects ranging from personal issues to functional ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Among the personal aspects of independence, one thing which is important is the need to appoint as members of the decision-making bodies of the Eurosystem persons who are independent not only of political or economic influences, but also of national interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.65,0)">Their mandates are extensive and they cannot be removed before the end of their terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The fact that the Governing Council takes decisions collegially under the rule "one member, one vote"   also strengthens the Eurosystem's independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.89,0)">Functional independence implies, among other aspects, the prohibition for the ECB and the national central banks to take or seek instructions from any external body and the prohibition to give credit facilities to public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.69,0)">Independence does not mean opacity, lack of accountability, isolation or technocracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The more independent a central bank is - and the Eurosystem is, probably, the most independent central bank in the world - the larger the need to counterbalance independence with transparency and accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It also becomes more important to have a clear idea of the interaction of monetary policy with other economic policies and to avoid the risk of technocracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Allow me to elaborate on these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Transparency Transparency has to do with appropriate communication with market players, with economic agents - among them, of course, businessmen - and the public in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Today's dinner can be seen as an example of the ECB's transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">When I say "appropriate" communication I mean, first of all, communication which explains, which clarifies, the ECB's monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.21,0)">Explaining does not mean justifying.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Justification is also needed, but it refers more to another central bank principle, namely accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Explaining decisions is mainly related to the general goal of effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.74,0)">The effect of monetary policy decisions depends not only on their mechanical effects, but also on how they are perceived by the markets against the background of existing expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">"Preparing the markets" and explaining the relevant points of the decisions - why, why now, why so much - are the key aspects of good communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In connection with the "preparation of the markets" some experts understand that surprise is an ingredient for efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.51,0)">I do not share this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.93,0)">The roots of that belief are deeper than they seem: it has to do with a monetary policy concept which asserts that it can directly, positively and lastingly affect economic growth through the practice of so-called "surprise inflation".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.98,0)">It also has to do with a monetary policy concept which does not take into account the relevance of time consistency in order to be credible and, therefore, effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">"Preparation of the markets" is an important aspect of communication, although, quite frankly, I think that the markets are wise enough to prepare themselves alone and do not need a great deal of ad hoc preparations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.57,0)">Central bankers, in general terms, should avoid thinking that they have better information, or that they are wiser than market players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Both markets and central banks share common information which results, through a process of interaction, in better monetary policy results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">One specific point in connection with this shared information concerns the publication of the ECB's macroeconomic forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In this respect, as President Duisenberg already informed the European Parliament, preparations for publication continue and it is envisaged that the publication of forecasts will commence towards the end of 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Having said this, the same note of caution that President Duisenberg conveyed to the European Parliament should be added here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.94,0)">Forecasts are only one input into the decisions of the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.91,0)">The publication of forecasts by the ECB should not be viewed as a panacea for all the communication challenges faced by the ECB as a new institution in a multinational environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.73,0)">Forecasts themselves have significant shortcomings - for example, they are surrounded by considerable uncertainty and may quickly become outdated if the external environment changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.43,0)">Because of these shortcomings, monetary policy decisions cannot be made only on the basis of a central inflation forecast, as is made clear in the ECB's monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Indeed, the relevant input for policy decisions is the comprehensive analysis of the monetary and macroeconomic situation, including the forecast, and of the economic disturbances affecting the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We must publish forecasts in a manner which accurately reflects their real role in policy decisions and the uncertainties inherent in them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.37,0)">Any other approach could be potentially misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.77,0)">Transparency deals with the amount and the kind of information given and the timing of the communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">With regard to the amount and the type of information, the golden rule is not "the more, the better".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.59,0)">Giving too much information in a disorderly way, diverting attention from the substance to irrelevant details or procedural issues, paying attention to the persons instead of the facts, are ways of being opaque.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.65,0)">With regard to the timing, the golden rule is "the sooner, the better", because the reactions of the markets start immediately after the decision is taken and announced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.61,0)">In this respect, I should like to underline that, in the case of the ECB's monetary policy decisions, detailed information about the Governing Council's reasoning is made available very shortly after the meetings, therefore avoiding delays which are inherent in the publication of all forms of official minutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.56,0)">Additionally, once a month, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.61,0)">every other Governing Council meeting, the President and the Vice-President hold a press conference right after the meeting, followed by the rapid publication of the transcripts of the questions and answers on the ECB's website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Furthermore, the ECB Monthly Bulletin contains an in-depth analysis of the ECB's monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.88,0)">Transparency, as any other principle, reaches its limits when interfering with other principles like, for example, efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.24,0)">In this specific case, the "no comment" formula must be applied and accepted as the exception which confirms the rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Accountability Although related, accountability is somewhat different from transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It certainly implies the idea of "explaining", as transparency does, but accountability implies additionally and especially the idea of "justifying" and it also conveys the idea of being responsible for one's actions, in the ECB's case, before the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.12,0)">Transparency is more related to an ex ante or real-time explanation and has to be seen as an economic requirement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.78,0)">Accountability refers to an ex post justification and has to do with a political duty, namely central bank democratic control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Interaction Monetary policy interacts with the rest of the economic policies adopted by the European Union or the national authorities of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">If the ECB's monetary policy were active and short-term and fine-tune oriented, there would be a need for co-ordination between monetary policy and other economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.09,0)">This need for co-ordination would pose a risk to the ECB's independence and, therefore, also a risk to the efficiency of its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.14,0)">The lack of activism of the ECB's monetary policy, therefore, becomes an approach which favours independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We do not need to sit around a table with other policy-makers to decide in a co-ordinated manner which monetary policy we have to formulate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">We already know what to do ex ante, in a statutory manner, without any genuine need for co-ordinating our monetary policy decisions with others: we already know that we must provide the appropriate monetary conditions in order to comply with the primary objective of maintaining price stability and, provided that this primary objective is achieved, also to support the general economic policies of the area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In order to do so we certainly need exchange of information and co-operation, but not a co-ordination of every action which would put our independence at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.69,0)">The Maastricht Treaty and the decision-making process at the euro area level mention specific issues which require co-ordination between monetary and political authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.97,0)">The exchange of information and the co-ordination in certain areas other than monetary policy between political authorities and those of the Eurosystem takes place in several fora: the ECB's Governing Council meetings, which can be attended by the President of the Council and a member of the Commission without the right to vote, and also the ECOFIN, the Euro Group and the Economic and Financial Committee meetings, which are attended by Eurosystem representatives at different levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">No technocracy The members of the Governing Council of the ECB certainly have technical abilities, but they are not technocrats.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This means that the objectives to be pursued by the Eurosystem have not been established and prioritised by the Governing Council of the ECB, but externally by the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.6,0)">In other words, the Governing Council of the ECB does not make political choices, does not take political decisions, but technical ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.67,0)">If monetary policy decisions were to imply political choices - e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.02,0)">less stability and more employment, which is only an erroneous interpretation of the Phillips Curve - then monetary policy and monetary policy-makers should be subject to the normal political process of democratic societies and certainly not be put into the hands of independent central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Concluding remarks Allow me to conclude by referring to the possible future integration of Britain in the euro area, a subject which inevitably must be treated in a speech addressed to the members of the British Businessmen's Club.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.95,0)">First and foremost, it is important to stress that the Governing Council of the ECB has no official position concerning this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is, of course, something to be decided by the British people when and in the form that they deem appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Having stated the official position, I should like to add that my personal preferences are in favour of the United Kingdom joining the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">I believe that both Britain and the euro area would benefit from it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The British economy and especially London's financial market would benefit from having the euro as their own currency because, unlike the pound sterling, the euro fulfils one condition necessary for a currency to be international, namely the size factor, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">the larger demographic, economic and financial importance of the area which supports the currency, what I like to call the "habitat" of the currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The size of the "habitat" matters in the sense that, without a certain critical mass, a currency cannot have real international relevance, however stable the currency may be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">On the other hand, the euro area and the euro would also benefit from British integration because, among other reasons, it would increase its "habitat" and, especially, without a doubt, the presence of London's financial centre in the euro area would reduce the present relative imbalance - compared with the United States - between its economic basis and the degree of development of its capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Allow me to finish by stressing that these are my personal views on an issue which must, of course, be mentioned at a dinner organised by the British Businessmen's Club.</span>
