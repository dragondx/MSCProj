    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)"> The European banking sector - the big challenges Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, IIF European Chief Risk Officer Forum, Frankfurt, 20 November 2017 Have you ever heard of Metéora?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Metéora is a group of rock pillars in Greece at the very top of which several monasteries were built centuries ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.71,0)">As you can imagine, it is quite hard to reach these monasteries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.4,0)">In fact, until the 1920s or so, the only way to get there was by sitting in a basket which the monks then pulled up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.64,0)">Now the story goes that, one day, a tourist got very nervous half-way up the cliff.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.36,0)">He noticed that the rope attached to the basket he was in looked quite old and rather frayed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.72,0)">So he asked the monk who was accompanying him if they ever replaced the rope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.43,0)">“Of course we do,…” the monk replied, “…whenever it breaks.” I don’t have to tell you that this is not how risks should be managed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It is our job, the job of risk managers and supervisors, to be a tad more forward-looking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.9,0)">We have to ensure that the rope is replaced before it breaks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">And we have to ensure that proper safety measures are in place should the rope break unexpectedly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.39,0)">But in reality, it’s a bit more complex, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.61,0)">With regard to banks it’s not just a rope that might break.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There are many different risks that have to be well managed to ensure the well-being of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Some risks are quite likely to materialise, others less so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">We all have a list of risks in our minds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And I am sure that these lists look quite similar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.37,0)">They might include interest rates that could be too low for too long, a sudden reversal of risk premia, geopolitical uncertainties, non-performing loans and cyber risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Banks must monitor and manage all these risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.14,0)">However, we don’t need to discuss all of them today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">So, in my speech I will focus on two of them: non-performing loans and Brexit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In addition to that, I will discuss a third topic which is closely connected to risk: capital buffers, and how to calculate them using internal models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.15,0)">Non-performing loans – the need to act In a sense, non-performing loans, or NPLs for short, are risks that have already materialised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.47,0)">Things have already gone wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.08,0)">Some creditors cannot service and pay back their loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.24,0)">The resulting NPLs pose a risk – for the affected banks and for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Only sound and healthy banks with clean balance sheets can reliably finance economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.39,0)">But balance sheets that are weighed down by NPLs are a huge burden for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.91,0)">NPLs are a drag on profits; they might also weaken trust in the banks; and they keep banks from lending to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">That’s why it is so important to resolve the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">And we are on the way to doing so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.19,0)">Since 2015, the ratio of NPLs in the euro area has gone down from around 7.5% to around 5.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.99,0)">In absolute terms, we are talking about a decrease of about €200 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">So, things are moving forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.46,0)">However, in some parts of the banking sector, the ratio is still too high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.38,0)">I realise, of course, that eliminating NPLs is easier said than done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.91,0)">First, it is difficult to sell them – there is hardly any market for them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.58,0)">Second, it is sometimes difficult to resolve them in court.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.09,0)">While foreclosure procedures in some countries last less than a year, in other countries they can take six years or even longer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.25,0)">These are hurdles but they must not serve as excuses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.04,0)">On the contrary, if a bank is not able to recover value from the collateral for a non-performing loan within an adequate time frame, it is questionable whether this collateral should be acknowledged as risk coverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">So, the banks need to do more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">They must devise ambitious, realistic and credible plans to get rid of their non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And now is the time to do it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The economy in the euro area has been growing for more than four years now; we are experiencing a broad-based, solid recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">This is an ideal backdrop for banks to tackle their NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We published qualitative guidance to banks on that very subject earlier this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It sets out the ways in which banks are encouraged to deal with non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">On that basis, we have scrutinised the reduction plans devised by the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">And we have already started to provide feedback.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We have been assessing the banks’ strategies with three questions in mind: how ambitious are they?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">How realistic are they?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And is the governance in order?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Regarding their ambition, unsurprisingly the reduction targets set by banks vary greatly, from 3% to 83% over three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.8,0)">As you can no doubt imagine, we think that some banks’ targets are not ambitious enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To assess how realistic the banks’ strategies are, we look at the timelines, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.76,0)">In general, we don’t like strategies that simply defer reductions to later years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We also look at potential tools to be used, such as cures, sales or write-offs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Here, we expect the strategies to be well diversified, not just focusing on a single tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And there is another thing we need to take into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.31,0)">How realistic a strategy is also depends on provisioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Does the foreseen level of provisioning support the strategy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.36,0)">Could there be a disconnect between portfolios which are meant to be sold and the associated projected provisioning?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Given current market prices, these two elements might not always match.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">That said, we have observed a trend of increasing coverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But dealing with NPLs also requires us to look to the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Once the balance sheets have been cleaned up, they should stay like that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">That is why we have published a draft addendum to our guidance, which is currently the subject of a public consultation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This draft provides transparency for the banks as we lay out what we expect from them in general in terms of prudential provisioning for future NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">We are aiming for a structured dialogue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.51,0)">The starting point for this dialogue is defined by our general expectations and whether the bank concerned deviates from them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">When the bank provides reasoning and evidence to back up this deviation, there is no need to consider supervisory action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.9,0)">But there might be cases where the reasoning and evidence is not convincing at all, and where we might still regard the provisions as insufficiently prudent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In such cases, we will consider taking supervisory action under Pillar And in that case, we would have a broad range of measures at our disposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We might, for instance, require the banks to report, in detail, on the evolution of their NPLs; to collect different information; to re-evaluate the collateral taken in to cover the loans; or to apply specific adjustments, such as deductions and filters, to the calculation of own funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.37,0)">Such actions are nothing new: they are part and parcel of a supervisor’s daily work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">We have done a lot in respect of non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But that’s our job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It is our job to address vulnerabilities in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.41,0)">And who would deny that non-performing loans are among the biggest vulnerabilities?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.12,0)">We have to deal with them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">And more than that, our actions complement the NPL action plan agreed on by European finance ministers in the summer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.94,0)">After all, it’s not just up to banks and supervisors to deal with NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Governments can and should help too, with a view to repossessing the collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.02,0)">In some countries there are no specialised courts or judges to deal with insolvencies, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.95,0)">Also, there are often no time limits for insolvency procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.01,0)">All these factors and others slow down the resolution of NPLs, and they could all be addressed by national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">With a level playing field in mind, we should aim for a situation where court resolution of NPLs works equally smoothly in all countries, and where out-of-court settlements are common tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, non-performing loans have slowly built up over the years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">So there was hardly an element of surprise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Other risks are different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.76,0)">They linger out of sight for a while, and then they emerge suddenly and unexpectedly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.23,0)">Brexit is the most recent example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Brexit – the clock is ticking As regards Brexit, the main issue for banks has been clear from day one: market access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.8,0)">Once the United Kingdom has left the EU, banks operating from the UK might lose the EU passport.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.26,0)">And with it, they might lose access to the European market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.18,0)">And by the way, that is also an issue for European banks that do business in the UK.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.56,0)">They keep the EU passport, of course, but might lose access to the UK market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.6,0)">So, once the UK has left, banks that operate from there might have to seek another route into the European market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And the most obvious one is to become part of the European market, that is, to relocate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Likewise, European banks that operate in the UK might have to find a way to maintain market access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.73,0)">And that is a pressing issue, as the deadline is just over 16 months away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">So banks should be taking expeditious steps now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But are they?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.74,0)">Well, the picture is a bit mixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First, there are those banks which access the European market from the UK – the “incoming” banks, from our point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">They are making progress in preparing for the post-Brexit world, although details and decisions are often still missing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.2,0)">That said, there are still some banks, mostly smaller ones, which seem to be delaying their final decision on relocating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Second, there are those banks which access the UK market from the EU – the “outgoing” banks, from our perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Most of these banks have also made plans, which is good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.78,0)">Still, some of these plans remain a bit too high-level, in our view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">So, more work needs to be done, even if the circumstances might be challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.78,0)">My message to all affected banks is this: don’t procrastinate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.71,0)">No one will wait for you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.37,0)">When Brexit happens you will either be prepared, or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I advise you to be prepared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And there are a lot of things that need to be considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.42,0)">Settlement finality, for instance, might be affected by Brexit, because the protection of the EU Settlement Finality Directive regarding the unwinding of transfer orders will no longer apply across the Channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.58,0)">Another issue is the continuity of contracts, that is, the ability of market participants to continue servicing existing contracts, in particular derivatives contracts, without appropriate permissions in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Banks should therefore include this topic in their contingency plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">And finally, banks should assess what Brexit means for their recovery plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.31,0)">After all, it could raise barriers and make certain recovery options less feasible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.11,0)">But Brexit is not just something the banks have to think about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.06,0)">It also raises a lot of questions for us supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">And right from the start, we have worked hard to answer all these questions and map out our approach to Brexit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">We have to think about cross-border banking groups, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In the wake of Brexit, new banks will be set up in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And they will most certainly be part of banking groups which are headquartered outside the EU, in a third country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This raises the question of how autonomous the new euro area entities will be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Will they become well-established banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.49,0)">Or will they end up as shell companies, which are overly reliant on other group entities from outside the EU?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.61,0)">And to be very clear: that’s not what we want to see.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">We expect banks to manage some of their risks locally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">They need local staff, and they need local infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In respect of market risk, banks must be able, in the medium to long term, to trade locally on a permanent basis, and they must have local risk committees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Likewise, they will need to trade and hedge risks not just with other group entities but with diversified counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Against that backdrop, we are currently working on a booking model assessment framework, which will set out what we expect from banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Naturally, our expectations will follow the principle of proportionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">In other words, large banks that are highly interconnected and conduct complex capital market operations will have to meet higher expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But it’s not just booking models that play a role here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I already mentioned the need for local staff.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It seems, however, that some incoming banks have something in mind which is referred to as “dual-hatting”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It means that staff members carry out functions in more than one entity of the group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Here, we have some concerns, in particular if dual-hatting includes important functions, extending to that of the CEO.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.4,0)">Wearing two hats might cause conflicts of interest and limit the time that can be spent on each.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.58,0)">This is even more of an issue when the relevant staff members are physically located outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In our view, certain key roles should not be part of such dual-hatting arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In other words, euro area entities must be sufficiently independent from group entities that are located outside the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We will not accept shell companies; that’s for sure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.83,0)">We do not see them as banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And we won’t accept more inventive set-ups either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In order to avoid having to move staff and assets to the Continent, some banks seem to be considering the idea of establishing a subsidiary in the euro area, which would then set up a branch in the United Kingdom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This branch would use the subsidiary’s EU passport to enter the European market from the UK.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.38,0)">We have serious misgivings about this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">First, the primary reason for establishing a branch should be to serve the market of the country where the branch is based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.09,0)">Then, there are legal issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Can a third-country branch use its parent company’s EU passport to access the European market from that third country?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.38,0)">That cannot be in the spirit of European law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.01,0)">And the subsidiary might just serve as a shell company.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">As I said, we do view these kinds of design critically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Internal models – setting capital buffers Ladies and gentlemen, I have described a small part of our risk landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.44,0)">As you know, the current overall risk landscape is much wider than that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">To deal with risks, banks need to hold adequate capital buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">These buffers serve as a universal protection against potential losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.18,0)">A bank’s risk-weighted assets should be the basis on which the capital requirements are calculated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.41,0)">It is the banks who set the risk weights, using their own internal models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">So the models have to work properly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">And there has to be a level playing field regarding the supervisory approval of these models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.76,0)">You know just how much the processes for approving internal models differed across euro area countries in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That’s why we are now assessing all major internal models used by those banks directly supervised by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This targeted review of internal models, TRIM for short, is a huge project; we are planning to do about 200 on-site investigations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">It is probably the biggest project since the health check for banks which we conducted in 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">What do we want to achieve with TRIM?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Well, there are four goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">First, we want to ensure that the models used by banks comply with regulatory standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Second, we want to harmonise the way in which we treat internal models from the supervisory perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There should be no unwarranted or undue heterogeneity in capital requirements for banks with similar risk profiles, just because they are headquartered in different jurisdictions within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Third, we want to ensure that the results of internal models are driven by risk and by risk only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">They should not be materially driven by modelling choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">And fourth, as a result of all this, we want to confirm that capital requirements are indeed adequate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">So, once we have finalised TRIM, and once the banks have addressed all potential findings, capital requirements will be calculated in a more consistent way across institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">That said, it will take us a while to finalise TRIM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">As I mentioned, it is a huge project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Still, we are on track – thanks to the good cooperation with banks and the dedication of our teams.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">We started our actual reviews of internal models in April of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">By mid-2018, we will have conducted 120 on-site inspections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We have already launched more than two-thirds of these.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As for credit risk, our focus lies on models that cover exposures to retail customers or small and medium-sized enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In addition, we also focus on market risk and counterparty credit risk models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">But we will also look beyond that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">From mid-2018 into 2019, we will assess models that cover low-default portfolios.</span><span style="background-color:
