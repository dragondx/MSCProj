    <span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)"> Basel III and monetary policy Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB at the International Banking Conference – “Matching Stability and Performance: The Impact of New Regulations on Financial Intermediary Management”, Milan, 29 September 2010 Introduction   Ladies and gentlemen, In the past three years, researchers have made considerable progress in explaining the causes of the recent financial turbulence and the mechanisms by which instability spread through the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.56,0)">The events have spurred thinking on banks’ risk management practices, on the incentives for excessive risk-taking, and on the reasons for the failure of regulation and supervision of the financial sector to prevent such events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Numerous national and international bodies have proposed new regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This conference provides an excellent opportunity to reflect on the impact of the new banking regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In my remarks today I will focus on the one aspect of the proposed regulation put forward by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision which has received less attention from the international media, but which is very relevant for monetary policy, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">liquidity standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.38,0)">The implementation of those standards will cause banks to change their investment behaviour and may change the structure of some financial market segments, thereby affecting the transmission channels of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It is very important that any such changes are well understood if they are to be factored into monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">After briefly describing the proposed measures, I will first focus on the impact of the regulation on financial markets, then analyse the implications for economic activity and the financial system, and finally, turn to the implications for monetary policy, including the possible interactions with the central bank’s operational framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.91,0)">The proposed liquidity regulation One of the key problems that financial institutions faced when the financial turbulence started in mid-2007 was the urgent funding need that resulted from a high degree of maturity mismatch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.93,0)">While assets tended to have a rather long-term horizon, funding of these investments was often done at the very short end of the yield curve in the wholesale markets for liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.38,0)">This implied a need to rely continuously on the roll-over of short-term liabilities in the wholesale money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Prior to the crisis, this posed no problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The financial system had ample liquidity, as measured, for instance, by compressed spreads and low volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Financial innovation, in particular asset securitisation, and the rapid growth of the so-called shadow banking system were the main drivers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.4,0)">However, they also became the main cause of banks’ fragilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.46,0)">The financial crisis has exposed the inadequacy of banks’ liquidity risk-management practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.89,0)">It has shown that the build-up of contingent liquidity claims, arising for instance from off-balance sheet financing vehicles, and excessive reliance on financial markets for providing funding are conditions doomed to generate financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.99,0)">When the markets for liquidity dried up suddenly and unexpectedly – most markedly at the beginning of the crisis, and after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers – many institutions faced difficulties in refinancing the large amounts to be rolled over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.94,0)">The resulting funding problems spilled over to other segments of the financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.49,0)">The state-dependent nature of market liquidity took many by surprise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.32,0)">Markets that seemed to be working smoothly suddenly dried up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.1,0)">Indeed, many securities that were regarded as highly liquid in pre-crisis times suddenly became illiquid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">The underlying characteristics of the assets, such as their complexity, turned out to be crucial for their liquidity under stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.38,0)">This points to the fact that the concept of liquidity itself is not straightforward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.5,0)">What seems liquid today may be less liquid tomorrow or under specific circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.72,0)">We witnessed this phenomenon also in the market for some sovereign signatures in Europe, which abruptly became illiquid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.34,0)">The causes and consequences of this sudden drying-up of liquidity have been discussed extensively in the academic literature of the past two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">New regulations have been proposed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I will consider the liquidity regulation proposed by the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The Basel proposal is centred on two new standards to establish minimum levels of liquidity for internationally active banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">The standards aim to promote the resilience of banks’ liquidity risk profiles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The first standard aims to raise the buffer of high-quality liquid assets so that the banks can withstand stress scenarios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This standard, called the liquidity coverage ratio , measures whether banks hold an adequate level of unencumbered, high-quality liquid assets to meet net cash outflows under a well-defined stress scenario persisting for a period of one month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The second standard is of a more structural and longer-term nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">It tries to ensure a closer alignment of the funding of longer-term assets or activities with more stable medium or longer-term liability and equity financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The standard, called net stable funding ratio , sets a minimum amount of funding that is expected to be stable under conditions of extended stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This minimum amount depends on the liquidity characteristics of various assets that the institutions hold over a one-year horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The two standards are complemented by a set of tools for monitoring the liquidity risk exposures and for exchanges of information among supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">The two standards aim to make banks more resilient to liquidity shocks by matching the maturity profile of in- and outflows more closely, and by setting aside a buffer of high-quality liquid assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The overall goal is to strengthen the resilience of the individual financial institutions and, more broadly, markets, and to avoid illiquidity spillovers to other institutions or market segments, which could lead to a systemic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Their implementation should be seen in the context of broader regulatory reforms, in particular those agreed upon by the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision earlier this month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.05,0)">An issue to be considered is whether the intended changes in banks’ behaviour resulting from the new regulation may have some unintended consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Since market participants will adjust to the new regulation, it is possible that the changes affect market structures, perhaps fundamentally so, and not necessarily in ways that are foreseen or desired by the regulators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Therefore, it is necessary to think carefully how banks may change their behaviour and to make sure that the new regulation will achieve its goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">From a central bank perspective, it is also important to assess the implications for the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.24,0)">In particular, the new rules are likely to impact on the markets for liquidity and on the demand for central bank refinancing, thereby affecting the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Below, I will mainly focus on the impact of the liquidity coverage ratio, as its implementation is likely to have the most relevant effects for central banking, and its formulation is currently more advanced than the one for the other liquidity standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.64,0)">Implications for financial markets Markets will be affected by the new regulation in several ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">One way is the categorisation of assets into liquid and illiquid assets for the numerator of the liquidity coverage ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The currently foreseen regulation includes cash, central bank deposits, and high-quality government securities in the ‘liquid assets’ category.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.66,0)">Corporate and covered bonds are included with a haircut.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The choice of the assets to be considered as liquid is consistent with the evidence during the recent crisis, which has confirmed that the degree of liquidity can vary enormously across markets in periods of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The implementation of the new liquidity standard is intended   to favour those assets that are counted as liquid, and at the same time reduce incentives to hold assets that are considered less liquid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.91,0)">This will affect the functioning of the underlying markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.36,0)">In particular the yields of liquid securities are expected to decline relative to those of illiquid ones, so that yield spreads between liquid and illiquid assets would become wider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.27,0)">At the moment, it is difficult to quantify the impact on the different market segments, or to judge whether the adjustment will take time or be abrupt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">But it can be expected that the categorisation of assets into certain classes of liquidity will lead to a ‘cliff effect’, by which the regulatory categorisation of assets as either liquid or illiquid plays a crucial role for the future of their market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.43,0)">Moreover, it implies that changes in market conditions, such as a downgrade, can move assets from one category into the other, leading to sudden changes in banks’ fulfilment of the liquidity coverage ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.88,0)">This could make their fulfilment somewhat unpredictable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.32,0)">The cliff effect could also imply sudden changes in the market conditions for the asset in question, which could suffer from a sudden drying-up of market activity or liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the latest revision of the proposal of the liquidity coverage ratio, some attempts were made to introduce intermediate categories of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">This somewhat reduces the cliff effect, but it still remains significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.24,0)">Another way in which different segments of financial markets will be affected in an asymmetric manner by the regulation is the maturity profile, which is key for the denominator of the liquidity coverage ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.65,0)">Since the denominator consists of expected outflows in a stress situation over the following 30 days, shorter-term funding that needs to be repaid within that period will be penalised relative to long-term funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.29,0)">This is an intended effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The implication is that the relative size of wholesale funding markets for different maturities will change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.77,0)">Ultimately, the interaction of demand and supply effects will determine the overall impact on the volume and liquidity of the different segments of the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.32,0)">At this stage it is difficult to draw clear conclusions, but it may well be the case that activity at the short end of the money market will decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">As regards interest rates, the increased demand for and lower supply of longer-term financing   stemming from the introduction of the liquidity coverage ratio is expected to lead to a relative increase of interest rates for maturities longer than the threshold established by the regulation   as compared with shorter maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.77,0)">This would imply a steeper money market yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Such effects are important for central banks – a point I will consider later on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.11,0)">First, less active money markets, and a corresponding higher volatility of short-term interest rates, could make the transmission of monetary policy signals more difficult and less precise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.39,0)">Second, an increase in the steepness of the money market yield curve would affect the transmission mechanism and the information extracted from the yield curve for monetary policy purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">To the extent that this effect is well understood and anticipated, central banks will be able to adjust their policies to the changed market environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.91,0)">Transitory changes during an adjustment period may pose however some challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Implications for economic activity Let me now turn to the implications for real economic activity associated with the new regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.93,0)">There is a widespread perception that the new measures will act at the macroeconomic level as a significant negative supply shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.03,0)">Higher bank holdings of liquid-and-low-return assets and higher funding costs due to the lengthening of the maturity structure of banks’ liabilities are regarded as additional operating costs that banks will try to pass on to their retail business along all margins: higher lending rates, tighter lending standards, and active shedding of loans in order to leave room for liquid assets in banks’ balance sheets – something akin to a credit crunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.34,0)">According to this mechanistic view of the impact of the new measures, policy-makers face a trade-off between the degree of safety of the banking system and economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.77,0)">I believe that this reasoning suffers from what I would call a ‘partial equilibrium’ and ‘static’ perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">It is ‘partial equilibrium’ because it does not allow for banks’ adjustment to the potentially higher costs of intermediation in other ways, such as efficiency gains, reductions in compensations, business restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.28,0)">And also because it does not consider that the higher degree of banks’ safety brought about by the new regulation implies that premia required by investors to fund banks may undergo a generalised decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is a ‘static’ perspective because it does not balance the transient costs that may arise along the transition phase with the permanent benefits associated with a more stable and safer financial environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">More generally, any analysis of the costs of achieving a sounder financial system for economic activity should take into account the costs that taxpayers have to bear when a financial crisis occurs, and the impact it has on growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Recently published studies carried out by the working groups established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the Financial Stability Board attempted to perform such a cost/benefit analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The benefits are measured by combining the decline in the probability of banking crises made possible by the new regulation with the average output losses associated with banking crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">It is found, for instance, that a 25% increase in the ratio of liquid assets over total assets could reduce the probability of banking crises by about one percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">This result has to be combined with the other finding that, for each percentage point reduction in the probability of a banking crisis, the expected annual economic benefit ranges from 0.2% of GDP   to 1.6% of GDP  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.78,0)">As regards the costs, it has been found that a 25% increase in banks’ holding of liquid assets over total banks’ assets would lead to a loss in GDP of about 0.1% per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.79,0)">I should add, though, that these results are characterised by high uncertainty because of the lack of consistent historical data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.16,0)">In addition, the methodology used to quantify the costs is likely however to overestimate the true costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">First, it assumes that premia embedded in banks’ funding costs will not decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Second, it assumes that banks will respond mechanically by maintaining their return on equity at pre-crisis levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Third, it does not consider that banks may fully adjust by downsizing the trading book with little impact on their retail business, as the recent Swiss experience with the new capital requirements seems to suggest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.44,0)">Fourth, the analysis does not consider that there may be offsetting factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">For instance, it is likely that the new regulation will lead to a higher demand from banks for government bonds to fulfil the liquidity ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.98,0)">This could exert downward pressure on ‘risk-free’ interest rates, especially at medium and long-term maturity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These generally form the basis for pricing mortgages and other banks’ lending rates with long-term initial rate fixation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Finally, the results are predicated on the assumption of no monetary-policy reaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">This modelling choice helps to clearly distinguish macroeconomic developments from a possible policy reaction to such developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.64,0)">However, this implies that the results may overestimate the costs associated with the new measures, if they affect risks to price stability and monetary policy reacts to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.28,0)">Longer-term implications for the financial system It might be argued that my discussion of the net benefits associated with the new regulation still suffers from some ‘partial-equilibrium’ shortcomings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It does not consider that the endogenous banks’ response to the new regulation may run against the ultimate goal of making the financial system more stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.2,0)">The fear is that liquidity risks may be simply shifted outside the perimeter of regulated entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.62,0)">Such regulations could simply end up inflating the unregulated sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.09,0)">The assumption here is that the total amount of risk in the financial system is somehow exogenously given, and that the amount of risk in the banking sector and in the unregulated sector are inversely related.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.85,0)">Therefore, a pessimistic assessment of the new regulation may contend that it will only lead to a transfer of risk, trading off a reduction in the risk borne by the banking sector with a corresponding increase in the one borne by the unregulated sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.35,0)">To put it differently, policy-makers may choose the desired point on the downward sloping frontier linking the amount of risk in the regulated and unregulated sectors, but might not be able to shift the frontier downward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">While I agree that any banking regulation may set in motion some form of risk transfer across sectors, I believe that the new framework takes a step forward in making the financial system more stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me provide two examples of how the new measures aim at preventing banks from simply transferring their risk to the unregulated sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">First, banks may try to unload part of their risk via off-balance sheet constructs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.91,0)">But the new regulation makes it harder to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Both the liquidity coverage ratio and the net stable funding ratio take into account the potential impact of off-balance sheet exposures on banks’ liquidity conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.6,0)">In particular, the stress scenario underlying the liquidity coverage ratio includes an increase in derivative collateral calls and substantial calls on contractual and non-contractual off-balance sheet exposures, including committed credit and liquidity facilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And the net stable funding ratio determines, for each off-balance sheet class, a reserve of stable funding, which depends on the characteristic of each off-balance sheet exposure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Having said that, one has to admit that there are probably no limits to creativity when it comes to financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Second, banks may try to reduce the maturity of the loans they grant to corporates, small and medium-sized enterprises, and households in order to shift the roll-over and liquidity risk to the final users of financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.61,0)">But the new regulation is designed to make this strategy unattractive for banks, as only a part of these loans needs to be financed by stable funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Furthermore, the Governors and Heads of Supervision have decided that the final implementation of the new liquidity measures will be preceded by a long ‘observation period’ during which supervisors will monitor any unintended consequences of the new measures and modify the regulation accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The observation period for the liquidity coverage ratio is from 2011 to 2014, after which it is to be applied as a minimum regulatory measure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For the net stable funding ratio, the observation period starts in 2012, and it won’t become a minimum standard until 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.81,0)">Implications for monetary policy What would be the implications of the new liquidity regulation for the central bank’s operational framework and for the conduct of monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">5.1 Implications for the central bank operational framework I will first turn to the possible interaction of the new regulation with the central bank operational framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Let me remark that here, as a benchmark scenario, I’ll consider a hypothetical situation in which the ECB has returned to the pre-crisis framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">That is, to a system whereby it determines the aggregate liquidity provided to the banking sector in each open market operation by conducting variable rate tenders, with a fixed liquidity supply and a variable rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">There are three areas in which the new regulation can interact with the central bank’s operational framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">First, the demand for reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Second, the participation in the central bank’s longer-term operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.08,0)">Third, the impact on the collateral pledged to the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.68,0)">5.1.1 Demand for reserves The changes in the liquidity regulation can have an effect on the demand for central bank liquidity, because funds on central bank accounts obtained through open market operations or through a lending facility   will count as liquid assets for the liquidity coverage ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Therefore, the newly proposed regulation would make it more attractive to acquire liquidity from central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.62,0)">A structurally higher demand for central bank refinancing combined with an unchanged liquidity supply by the central bank would however cause tender rates at central banks’ open market operations to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The ECB could accommodate this demand by increasing the size of its open market operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">While in times of crisis, a stronger intermediation role by the central bank can be beneficial, in the long run it might crowd out market activity, and reduce incentives for peer monitoring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.34,0)">This could in turn increase risk-taking behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These are of course side-effects of the proposed regulations which should not be neglected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.27,0)">Not only the volume, but also the variation, of demand for central bank funding over time could be affected by the regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This might also play a role in determining the appropriate size of open market operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It’s possible that on some days banks will seek financing from the central bank for regulatory purposes more than they do on other days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.0,0)">This would lead to a time-varying demand for liquidity in central banks’ open market operations and a higher volatility of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.15,0)">In particular, such effects would depend on the enforcement of the regulatory measures, whereby calendar effects with temporary peaks in demand could arise, which tend to ‘pollute’ the control of short-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">5.1.2 Participation in longer-term operations A second area of interaction of the new regulation with the central bank’s operational framework arises from the maturity structure of the central banks’ operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Let me point out that in the liquidity coverage ratio, banks’ liquid assets are put in relation to expected outflows over a 30-day horizon; for higher outflows within this period, banks would need to hold more liquid assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Thus, the question of whether funds obtained in open market operations need to be repaid to the central bank before or after this horizon will play a role in the fulfilment of the ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">This will make central bank refinancing for longer maturities more attractive than for shorter ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.96,0)">In particular, liquidity obtained in the Eurosystem longer-term refinancing operations, which have a three-month maturity, would not count as liquidity outflow, at least not for the first two months in which the outstanding maturity is still longer than 30 days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For regulatory purposes, banks might thus try to shift their participation in the ECB’s open market operations from the one-week to the three-month operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The expected increase in total demand for central bank refinancing, which I mentioned before, is therefore likely to materialise, especially in longer-term operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.82,0)">With an unchanged composition of the maturity structure of ECB operations, shifts in the demand from short- to longer-term funds would lead to changes in marginal auction rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Tender rates for longer-term operations would increase, and those for shorter-term operations would be reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Thus, the ‘term structure of tender rates’ would become steeper, similar to the term structure of money market interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, the rates on the main refinancing operations   convey the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.79,0)">For this reason, the ECB will monitor carefully whether a shift in demand from short-term to longer-term operations will take place that could lead to reduced participation in the main refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.42,0)">Should this reduction occur – which seems highly unlikely, but at this juncture it is difficult to quantify the precise extent – the ability of the central bank to control short-term rates, and thus to signal its monetary policy stance, might be affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The ECB could adapt its liquidity management practices in order to guarantee a continued high demand for short-term refinancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">5.1.3 Collateral pledged to the central bank The third area in which the new regulation could interact with the central bank’s operational framework is the collateral pledged to the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As you know, all refinancing by the Eurosystem is provided only against the provision of adequate collateral, so as to protect it from losses should a counterparty default.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">At the same time, collateral should be available to a wide set of counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For this purpose, the criteria for assets to be eligible as Eurosystem collateral are quite broad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Government securities, corporate and bank bonds, as well as high-quality asset-backed securities and some other assets are accepted as collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In addition, risk management tools are applied to ensure protection of the Eurosystem against credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The wide range of eligible assets proved to be extremely valuable in recent years, when markets for certain types of security became very illiquid, but banks continued to refinance themselves via the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">As discussed before, the liquidity coverage ratio is supposed to induce banks to hold more liquid assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">One way for banks to boost their ratio is to keep their most liquid assets on their balance sheets, and to pledge the more illiquid ones as collateral in ECB liquidity-supply operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is possible as long as the definition of liquid assets is narrower than the criteria for eligibility in Eurosystem operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This implies that banks may try to circumvent the spirit, if not the letter, of the new regulation by shifting more of their risky assets to the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The argument that central banks are in a better position to bear liquidity risks by their ability to create money should not be turned into a justification for regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.86,0)">This is especially true when considering that also credit risk could be shifted to central banks as a consequence of this  behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">5.2 Monetary policy and the build-up of financial risk The interaction between monetary policy and the amount of risk in the economy is not confined to the details of the collateral framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It extends also to the interest-rate setting itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.53,0)">Unfortunately, most macromodels are not well suited to analyse the relationship between monetary policy and the build-up of financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">They generally assume that monetary policy works via the impact of the short-term policy rate on long-term interest rates and the exchange rate, possibly amplified by the so-called credit channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.33,0)">However, recent research has challenged the traditional wisdom by suggesting that in reality there are other channels at work which are relevant to understanding the interaction between monetary policy and financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">First, it has been suggested that policy rates would be crucial in their own right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.41,0)">The reason is that financial institutions normally tend to maintain very low spare capacity on their balance sheets – for cost reasons – making wholesale funding the only readily available source of funds to finance at the margin an additional unit of investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The close association of money market rates to policy rates implies that the central bank has a direct grip on the marginal price of financial institutions’ leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.95,0)">And leverage is one of the key factors that determine the amount of risk and the extent of vulnerability present in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.77,0)">Second, it has been suggested that monetary policy works also via the so-called ‘risk-taking’ channel, whereby low levels of policy rates tend to induce excessive risk-taking by financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">These new insights can shed light on the effects that very expansionary monetary conditions can have on financial imbalances, fuelling in particular the build-up of maturity mismatches via excessively low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And these insights also make clear the hazard to which the central bank is constantly exposed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">If a liquidity crisis occurs, the central bank may have to step in and provide abundant liquidity to preserve the functioning of the transmission mechanism and counteract risks to price stability emanating from systemic instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.41,0)">Anticipating this policy response, the private sector may in normal times under-price the value of liquidity, which in itself increases the probability of a liquidity crisis in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.66,0)">Giavazzi and Giovannini   have recently described this hazard as a ‘trap’, which ultimately arises from an asymmetric response of monetary policy to liquidity conditions: benign neglect during the build-up of liquidity risk, and forceful interventions during a liquidity crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">They conclude that monetary policy can avoid this situation by setting the interest rate at a higher level than the one suggested by macroeconomic conditions, as measured by standard indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.65,0)">In particular, they recommend following a Taylor rule appropriately modified to counteract excessive liquidity transformation by the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">They do not discuss however how to make this prescription operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">But I am sure that these insights will spur further research and policy discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Since the inception of monetary policy in the euro area in 1999, the ECB has taken a pragmatic approach to limit asymmetries in its policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Its two-pillar monetary policy strategy accords a prominent role to the analysis of money, credit and liquidity conditions, thus explicitly including in its assessment factors that tend to be empirically associated with the build-up of risk and financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Conclusion The regulation proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision should not be assessed in isolation, but in the context of the comprehensive set of measures to strengthen the resilience of the financial sector and to reduce its overall level of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Real economic activity will profit from such increased stability and, in my view, outweigh the direct cost of the regulation, especially in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">To be sure, the new regulation will have an impact, in particular on banks’ liquidity management and the markets for liquidity along several dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is actually the aim of the regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.84,0)">Had the result been ‘business as usual’, this would have probably made some market participants quite happy, but would have been a sign of failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There is of course an issue of gradualism and calibration, with a view to avoiding the two extremes – an excessively abrupt adjustment and an everlasting phasing-out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">But it seems to me that this issue has been dealt with in a reasonable way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.35,0)">The changes in the financial system caused by the regulation will have to be factored in also by the policy authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For central banks, the changes may be far-reaching, ranging from the transmission mechanism of monetary policy to interactions with several aspects of the operational frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">At the ECB we are actively working on these issues to ensure that our monetary policy continues to be conducted in an effective way, also in the new environment, so as to maintain price stability, our primary goal.</span>
