    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)"> Reception for the Opening of the European Cultural Days Welcome address by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Frankfurt, 3 November 2015 Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to welcome you to this reception for the opening of the ECB’s Cultural Days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">As you know, each year we dedicate this series to one of the 28 EU members as a way to underscore Europe’s diversity and richness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This time the focus is on Malta.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">At the formal opening I will speak more about Maltese culture and the programme of upcoming events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Here, however, I would like to tell you something about your hosts – what the ECB is currently doing, and most importantly, why.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Since last year, when we welcomed the panoply of Bulgarian culture to Frankfurt, the ECB has been through a major transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Tomorrow, we will celebrate our first full year as the supervisor of Europe’s significant banks – a project which has involved us hiring over 1000 new staff and setting up a new European institution from scratch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">We also this year officially inaugurated our new building, which has now become a symbol of the Frankfurt skyline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">What has not changed, however, is the ECB’s mandate to deliver price stability for the euro area, which we define as an inflation rate of “below but close to 2 percent” over the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">During the first 17 years of our history, inflation has averaged just over 1.8 percent – so pretty close to our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But note that this definition of price stability is symmetric: inflation should be neither too high nor too low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is a legacy of our colleague Otmar Issing, who appreciated the risks of too low inflation at a time when most people only had the risk of too high inflation in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.54,0)">Indeed, history shows that deflation can be just as damaging to the prosperity and stability of our economies as high inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.09,0)">To mention just some of the negative impacts, in a low inflation environment firms’ revenues fall but the wages they pay their employees are typically more “sticky”, so the real wages they have to pay rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.87,0)">That can lead to higher unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.3,0)">Monetary policy can also become less effective at supporting the economy, as lower inflation leads to higher real interest rates, which cannot be offset by conventional policy when interest rates reach zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.15,0)">And in a situation of high indebtedness, too low inflation increases the burden of servicing that debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.6,0)">In the aftermath of the crisis it has become, at times, more difficult for central banks to achieve the slow increase of price levels that they aim for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.98,0)">This is also true in the euro area where, thanks mainly to falling oil prices, inflation is currently around zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.53,0)">That would not be a serious problem if we saw low inflation only for one or two months, but it becomes worrisome if there is a risk of too low inflation for too long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.21,0)">In that scenario, it can start to affect people’s expectations of future inflation, which then makes low inflation self-fulfilling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">In line with our mandate, the ECB has therefore made full use of its conventional tools – interest rate cuts – to ward off these risks to price stability and keep inflation expectations anchored to our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">And since rates reached zero, we have switched to unconventional measures – namely large-scale asset purchases – as the main means to expand our stance and ensure that inflation returns gradually back to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Those asset purchases are proceeding smoothly and continue to have a favourable impact on the cost and availability of credit for firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.35,0)">But even though domestic demand remains resilient, concerns over growth prospects in emerging markets and other external factors are creating downside risks to the outlook for growth and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In this context, the degree of monetary policy accommodation will need to be re-examined at the Governing Council’s December meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">The Governing Council is willing and able to act by using all the instruments available within its mandate if warranted in order to maintain an appropriate degree of monetary accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.18,0)">Such decisions by the ECB often trigger a lively discussion in the public debate – and often with a quite different flavour depending on the country concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">While in some countries the main theme is typically that the ECB should “do more”, in Germany, as you know, the opposite is the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.83,0)">The low interest rate environment is often seen as a cause for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I would not be surprised if that is the case for many of you here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.5,0)">One concern is low interest rates unfairly punish savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.23,0)">I fully understand this – low interest rates of course lead to low nominal returns on certain types of assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.07,0)">But I think the extent of disquiet with the ECB about this issue also reflects some misunderstandings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There are two points in particular I would like to underline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">First, what matters for savers is not nominal returns on liquid assets such as deposits, but real returns – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.29,0)">what those returns actually buy – on the portfolios of assets that most households hold, which include for example shares.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">An interesting piece of research last month by our colleagues at the Bundesbank   showed that the real return since 2008 for German households on a typical private portfolio lay at 1.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">This was lower than the pre-crisis average, to be sure, but better than in several repeated periods since the early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.99,0)">Second, we need to keep in mind why interest rates are so low today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.69,0)">It is not an arbitrary decision of the central bank; it is because the euro area has been in a long and deep crisis where the economy needed low interest rates to recover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And what would happen if we were to raise rates in that environment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.3,0)">The answer is that it would only push us back into recession, which would mean lower incomes and more job insecurity for everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.19,0)">And then, the ECB would have to keep interest rates lower for longer to get the economy back on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">None of this would be in the interests of savers in any country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.79,0)">Moreover, if one takes a longer-term perspective, it is clear that low interest rates are also being driven by forces outside the ECB’s control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.46,0)">It is the productive capacity of the real economy that ultimately produces real returns on savings – and in the euro area, due to our ageing societies and low productivity, that is currently very weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This is not an issue monetary policy can solve; it depends on reforms that will make our economies more inclusive, flexible and innovative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The long-term interests of savers, in other words, depend on governments implementing the structural reforms that will transform our economies in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.99,0)">This brings me to another concern about our policies: that the implementation of our monetary policy in fact creates the opposite effect – that it decreases the willingness of governments to undertake structural reforms because they pay little interest on their debts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Again, while I can understand this concern, I think it needs to be looked at in context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.45,0)">First of all, the argument does not fit with the facts we have seen in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.43,0)">Spain, for example, started its labour market reforms when interest rates had already gone down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Italy undertook labour market reform at the beginning of this year of its own volition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">France pursued the Macron Reforms this year as well, and they are not yet finished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.31,0)">So I do not see convincing evidence that structural reforms are impossible without strong market pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Moreover, where very strong market pressure does lead to reforms, are we sure that they are the right ones?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.57,0)">Often we have seen in recent years that, when countries face severe sovereign debt tensions, they prioritise raising taxes rather than cutting unproductive expenditure and delay structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Those reforms that countries really need to boost their long-term growth – such as improving education or judiciary – do not come about in a crisis environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">They have to come about through societies recognising their deep-rooted challenges and collectively fixing them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But let’s imagine for a moment that all this were not the case – that market pressure was essential for structural reforms to happen – should that really be a factor in how the ECB makes its policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Remember that we have been given a narrow mandate in the Treaty to deliver euro area price stability, and that narrow mandate is what justifies our independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.34,0)">Nowhere in the Treaty does it say that the ECB should set interest rates in such a way as to force policy changes on unwilling governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.43,0)">For us to do that would be undemocratic and a misuse of the independence we have been given.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.43,0)">If anybody is to put pressure on governments to enact structural reforms, it has to be other governments within a democratically-agreed framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Indeed, this is why the ECB has frequently called for stronger European institutions for economic policymaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The point here is that one cannot expect the ECB to deliver the objectives that rightfully belong to other policymakers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">We will meet our price stability mandate, as we are obliged to do in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">But it is up to individual countries to build on that foundation and make their economies work better; and it is up to the euro area as a whole to strengthen the institutional architecture of our union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Only with such a common, comprehensive response can we durably leave this crisis behind, and re-focus on the purpose for which the euro was launched: the unity and prosperity of the peoples of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">That is no doubt a challenging task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">But the Cultural Days are a reminder what Europe is all about and why it is worth standing up for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Monatsbericht Oktober 2015</span>
