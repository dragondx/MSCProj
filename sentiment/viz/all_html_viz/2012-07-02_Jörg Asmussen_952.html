    <span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)"> Can we restore confidence in Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Speech by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, 16th Economist roundtable with the Government of Greece, “Transforming uncertainty into stability, wisdom and growth”, Athens, 2 July 2012 INTRODUCTION Thank you very much for inviting me today to open this roundtable with the Government of Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">The title of my intervention is “can we restore confidence in Europe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The simple answer is “yes”, because we must, to put monetary union back on a sustainable track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.56,0)">The more complicated part is how to do it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In my view, it requires finding the right balance between national and European responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">This has two key dimensions: First, what can Greece itself do to restore confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Second, what can the rest of the euro area do to restore confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">What Greece can do to restore confidence Let me begin with Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Under the first adjustment programme it has made substantial progress in adjusting its economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.4,0)">The fiscal deficit was reduced from 15.6% of GDP in 2009 to 9.1% in 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">And very important reforms, such as the pension reform, have been implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.75,0)">However, many other necessary reforms have not been followed through due to weak programme ownership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.97,0)">Moreover, policy implementation has virtually stalled over the last three months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">So the first priority for the new Greek government has to be getting the programme back on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.73,0)">Some observers will ask why.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.5,0)">They will say that the programme has failed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.02,0)">They will note that the Greek economy is not recovering as expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.06,0)">They will point out that large parts of the Greek population reject the conditions of the programme as a ‘diktat’ from Brussels and other capitals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">So let me make clear upfront: the programme is the best option for Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The difficulties that Greece is currently experiencing do not stem from the programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.54,0)">They stem from many years of unsustainable economic policies and a reluctance to implement the necessary reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The programme is so comprehensive because the problems in Greece are so deep-rooted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">With or without the programme, any Greek government would have to pursue a similar adjustment to bring the economy back on track and restore the confidence of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The difference is that with the programme, this adjustment is made much smoother.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The fiscal measures under the programme have been designed to gradually restore the sustainability of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.38,0)">If Greece were on its own, the adjustment would have to be much faster and more drastic, given that the sovereign has lost access to financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">So the programme is actually helping support the Greek people’s standard of living.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">The same is true of the reforms to improve competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Greece’s competitiveness gap vis-à-vis its main trading partners is still at least 15%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The programme aims at closing this gap through reforms to enhance the downward flexibility of prices – in the labour market and in product and services markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Implementing these reforms would create the basis for more export-oriented growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.73,0)">Without them, the economy would adjust primarily through lower production and employment, with disastrous effects for social cohesion Moreover, many of the reforms in the programme have been demanded for years by the Greek people themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">There is a silent majority that wants to see a well-functioning public administration that serves citizens, enforces tax compliance, and creates the conditions for private sector growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">And had the public administration reform proceeded as programmed, it would have offset some of the contractionary effects of fiscal consolidation, as has happened in other programme countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.66,0)">Avoiding illusory alternatives People, and especially politicians, do not like the notion that there are no alternatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.02,0)">True enough, there always are alternatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.68,0)">But they may not be realistic or acceptable ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Some commentators would like us to believe that exit and devaluation could solve Greece’s problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.87,0)">I do not wish to go into details of such assessments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.07,0)">Let me only say that much of what is published represents dangerously short-sighted and partial analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">We must also be realistic about the prospects for a so-called “Marshall Plan for Greece”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">I fully support a re-direction of EU funds to maximise growth and competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">But it takes time to programme and absorb these funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.82,0)">Greece has so far absorbed only around 35% of the cohesion funds available for 2007-2013 period, a level that in fact exceeds the EU average already.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">So any measures we take today will not be felt in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">What about relaxing the fiscal targets to support growth in the short run?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Again, we need a full analysis of what this implies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Delaying adjustment is risky: it would increase the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2020 above the 120% targeted under debt exchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This is the upper bound of what could still be considered sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.45,0)">And it is also not free: it requires additional funding from the creditor countries, because the country still runs a primary deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.18,0)">In some creditor countries this is challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.46,0)">It is difficult to ask voters in a country where average public sector wages are around €1000 per month, like in Estonia or Slovakia, to lend to a country where those wages are on average around €3000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The same holds true for emerging countries outside the euro area who participate in the financial assistance for Greece via the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Some of those even went through very painful but ultimately successful adjustment programmes themselves; take Brazil for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">If those countries help nonetheless, it is reasonable that, in return, they expect Greece to stick to its promises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Not because of any desire to control the Greek economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">But because solidarity has to go both ways, and a precondition for solidarity is solidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.9,0)">Getting the programme back on track So my point is this: the new government should not lose precious time looking to avoid or loosen the programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">It should instead focus on how to maximise the effectiveness of reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">And the key to this is much stronger programme ownership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">We know from experience in Latvia, Ireland and Portugal that ownership is a crucial ingredient for success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The new government, with a sufficient majority in parliament, has an opportunity to do this from “day one”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">This would give the single biggest boost to growth by removing the uncertainty that is paralysing the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Concretely, this means identifying measures to close the large fiscal gap in 2013-14; making up for delays in tax administration reform; resuming the stalled privatisation process; implementing the legislated labour market reforms; and revitalising reforms to liberalise product and services markets, starting with the full liberalisation of the closed professions and the complete implementation of the Business Friendly Greece action plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In other words, restoring confidence in Greece has to begin at home.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">And to do this effectively, authorities have to make the case more strongly for reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">They have to be clear that it is not for the Troika, or for any European leader, but for the good of Greece and its future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">This is a sine qua non for Greece to restore fiscal sustainability and competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">What the rest of the euro area can do to restore confidence Restoring confidence for the euro area is, of course, now a bigger challenge than resolving the Greek crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Other Member States and the European institutions also have an important role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.26,0)">Measures in other Member States Many euro area governments have avoided dealing with problems by hiding behind overly optimistic forecasts or unrealistic stress tests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.29,0)">But this is ultimately a self-defeating strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.52,0)">The problems do not go away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.38,0)">Instead, the market loses trust in official statements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.26,0)">Governments then have to take ever more drastic policy measures to win back credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.74,0)">Overall, the constant stream of missed targets and data revisions saps at euro area confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">For those countries receiving financial assistance, confidence can be restored by rigorously implementing their programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">For Ireland and Portugal, this means maintaining their strong track record of implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">For Spain, it means a convincing recapitalisation plan that removes all doubts about the solvency of its banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The first financial review can provide a basis for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">For Cyprus, it means finally addressing its macroeconomic and financial sector vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">For other Member States – including France and Germany – it means learning the lessons of the crisis so far and getting ahead of the curve on fiscal and structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Measures at the European level But as I said in my introduction, a strategy to restore confidence must strike the right balance between national and European responsibilities, and there are also important steps to be taken at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The most pressing is addressing the institutional design of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">The euro area needs to send a clear message that it has understood its design flaws and has a plan to correct them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">This would signal to markets that the euro area is a place they can invest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">And it would underscore Member States’ commitment to the euro and remove any doubts about its integrity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This alone would provide a major boost to confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The report by the four Presidents in principle endorsed by the European Council last week, sets out the four core building blocks of a genuine EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">While it is a vision for the future, each of these building blocks is designed to address the issues that are currently eroding confidence in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For instance, the financial market union would help break the link between banks and their sovereigns and stop deposit flight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.41,0)">The fiscal union would prevent countries from running up excessive debt levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Sound governance and enforceable rules can lay a path towards common debt issuance, although here the sequencing is key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The economic union would ensure that countries can adjust properly without an exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">And the political union would strengthen the democratic legitimacy of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">A commitment to reinforcing EMU in this way, coupled with the measures for Greece and other countries that I have described above, is the only way out of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There is no silver bullet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Those who advocate “once and for all solutions” – be that a banking licence for the ESM, a European transfer system, or the like – are contenting themselves with a superficial analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The crisis can only be resolved through determined steps on a number of fronts that address its root causes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">CONCLUSION Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The title of this conference is “Transforming uncertainty into stability, wisdom and growth”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">This reminds us that, in all difficult times, there are opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">While the situation in the euro area today is certainly challenging, we have in place a plan that is addressing long-standing weaknesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It will ultimately lead to greater long-term stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">But it is clear we need to improve confidence to smooth the path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This will only come through individual countries taking ownership for their situations, and the euro area as a whole taking responsibility for making EMU work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Fortunately, this is widely recognised across the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And now, simply, we have to do it.</span>
