    <span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)"> The euro@10: achievements and responsibilities Remarks by Jean-Claude TrichetPresident of the ECBat the ceremony of the European Parliamentto mark the 10th anniversary of the euro Strasbourg, 13 January 2009 Mr President, Honourable members of the European Parliament, It is an immense honour and a great pleasure for me to take part in this celebration of one of Europe’s most momentous achievements, the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.62,0)">One of Europe’s founding fathers – Jean Monnet – once said: “When an idea meets the needs of the time, it ceases to belong to its creators and becomes more powerful than those responsible for it”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.46,0)">And he added: “There is no such thing as premature ideas, there are only ripe times that one should wait for”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">For decades, the single European currency was merely an idea shared by a few people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.02,0)">Many others said that it could not be done, or that it was bound to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Today, the single currency is a reality for 329 million citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The creation of the euro will one day be seen as a decisive step on the long path towards an “ever closer union” among the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Since the introduction of the euro, fellow Europeans have enjoyed a level of price stability which previously had been achieved in only a few of the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This price stability is a direct benefit to all citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">It protects incomes and savings, and it helps to bring down borrowing costs, thus promoting investment, job creation and prosperity over the medium and long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The single currency has been a factor of dynamism for the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">It has enhanced price transparency, increased trade, and promoted economic and financial integration within the euro area and with the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In recent months we have seen another benefit of the euro: the financial crisis is demonstrating that in turbulent financial waters it is better to be on a large, solid and steady ship rather than on a small vessel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Would Europe have been able to act as swiftly, decisively and coherently if we did not have the single currency uniting us?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Would we have been able to protect many separate national currencies from the fallout of the financial crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">I believe that we can be proud of the reaction of European authorities, parliaments, governments and central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Together we have shown that Europe is capable of taking decisions, even in the most difficult circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">We owe the historic success of the euro to the determination and perseverance of a series of visionary leaders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">And we owe it to the effective interplay between European institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The European Parliament played a crucial role at the pioneering stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The Parliament was the first European institution to make proposals for a single currency, back in 1962.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">And in the past ten years, since the establishment of the ECB, our institutions have maintained a very close and fruitful dialogue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This dialogue has involved over 50 hearings of the members of the Executive Board before this Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The dialogue between the Parliament and the ECB is a very important exchange in terms of accountability, allowing the ECB to explain its decisions and actions to the general public and their elected representatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, during its first years of existence, the euro had to face major trials: the establishment of a sound and credible central bank and the creation of a stable new currency inspiring confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">These challenges were overcome successfully and the euro is today firmly established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Hence, this is certainly a time for celebration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.03,0)">But it is no time for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Current challenges are pressing, and new challenges will arise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The continued success of EMU will depend on how these challenges are addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This is the main responsibility for all authorities involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me mention three major challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.25,0)">First, the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.84,0)">The crisis has revealed fundamental weaknesses in the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">We are playing an active part in the global efforts to address these weaknesses and redesign the regulatory and institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">A lot of work remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Second, Economic Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">The solidity of the single currency rests on two pillars: a monetary policy firmly geared towards price stability and a set of sound economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The particular challenges on the economic front include the firm and credible implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, constant efforts to render our economies more productive, innovative and dynamic, and the avoidance of major competitive divergences within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Third, enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">When we started out ten years ago, we were 11 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As of 1 January this year, we are now 16 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This says a lot about our historic endeavour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Handling enlargement in the best fashion possible is a very inspiring and demanding challenge for all of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The euro is a historic achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">What matters most today is our responsibility for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">New challenges are arising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">If these challenges are faced with utmost lucidity and audacity, they can generate the powerful ideas which Jean Monnet referred to, and which have advanced us so far on the path of stability and prosperity in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
