    <span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)"> Speech Challenges to monetary policy normalisation Speech by Peter Praet , Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the SUERF conference “Sustainable Policy Responses: EU and US Perspectives”, New York, 20 September 2018 Introduction The euro area economy continues to expand at a rate that is above potential, despite a slow-down relative to the exceptional growth rates observed in the second half of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The underlying strength of the economy supports our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">At the same time, uncertainties relating to rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility have gained more prominence recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Significant monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">At our June monetary policy meeting, we initiated a rotation of our policy instruments from our asset purchase programme   towards our conventional instruments of monetary policy – the policy interest rates and forward guidance on their likely future evolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This had two main elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.77,0)">First, we said that we anticipated that we would gradually wind down our net asset purchases, subject to incoming data confirming our outlook for inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Our projections currently foresee that inflation will rise gradually but consistently towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Second, we updated and enhanced our forward guidance on the path for interest rates, which is now expressed in terms of the expectation that our key ECB interest rates will remain at their present levels “at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Finally, we maintained our intention to reinvest principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP “for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.8,0)">At our September meeting last week, and in line with the conditional plan announced in June, we decided to reduce the monthly pace of our net asset purchases, from €30 billion to €15 billion a month, for the period from October to December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">In addition, we reiterated the forward guidance on the path of all our monetary policy instruments, as mapped out in June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Against this background, I would like to focus today on two questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.47,0)">The first is why we anticipate that it is likely to be appropriate to terminate net asset purchases by the end of December this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The second is why we need to maintain an ample degree of monetary accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The rotation from the asset purchase programme to rate forward guidance The ECB’s APP has been a central component of the comprehensive package of measures which the Governing Council has deployed since June 2014 to safeguard price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">In addition to the APP and forward guidance on our key interest rates, a negative deposit facility rate and targeted longer-term refinancing operations   make important contributions to monetary accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">This combination of instruments allows for complementary and mutually reinforcing interactions in providing monetary accommodation, including possibilities to compensate for one another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Taken together, the measures we have adopted since June 2014 have had a substantial financial market impact, which has manifested itself in two ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.61,0)">First, risk-free interest rates have been compressed at all maturities, thus reducing the basis that banks and the capital markets adopt for determining the conditions at which credit is made available to borrowers  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Second, the policies have resulted in a liquidity creation effect, which is often considered a side-show relative to yield compression, but which was in fact critical to restoring intermediation in the strained financial conditions we faced when the policies were launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In the euro area, we can see this effect quite clearly in the development of broad money, specifically M3, over recent times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.81,0)">In 2013 M3 growth had fallen close to zero, as banks in large parts of the euro area sought to deleverage their balance sheets by severely curtailing credit and engaging in other contractionary actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.95,0)">Loan extinction became a powerful drag on money creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The APP broke that vicious circle by forcing fresh liquidity into the system, as the Eurosystem started paying for the purchased securities by creating reserves and deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">However, almost as soon as our net asset purchases started, bank credit to the economy began to be a source of money creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">More recently, as we embarked on reducing the pace of monthly purchases, we have observed a gradual shift in the growth momentum of M3 from the exogenous source of money creation through the APP to a rising contribution from endogenous deposit creation by banks due to a sustained pick-up in credit  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The APP has allowed banks to rebalance their portfolios and use their renewed balance sheet capacity to extend credit to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Together the expansionary effects of our policies spurred a substantial recovery, which gradually morphed into an expansion, and which is now in its fifth year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">To measure progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, we have applied three criteria: first, convergence of projected headline inflation to our medium-term aim; second, confidence in the realisation of this projected convergence path; and third, the resilience of inflation convergence even after the end of our net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">In terms of convergence, the June 2018 Eurosystem staff projections foresaw inflation at a level of 1.7% in 2018, 2019 and 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">These projections confirmed the pattern of convergence to levels closer to 2% that had become increasingly evident over a series of projections exercises  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This was subsequently confirmed by the September 2018 ECB staff projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Inflation expectations – both survey and market-based – have been gradually improving and are increasingly consistent with our inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.96,0)">The dispersion of the predictive distribution of market- and survey-based measures of inflation expectations has been compressed considerably since 2014  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.56,0)">Moreover, domestic cost pressures are strengthening amid high levels of capacity utilisation, tightening labour markets and rising wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.72,0)">They are estimated on the basis of call   and put options   with different strike rates on the   euro area HICPxT   index, assuming Black-Scholes option pricing and implied volatilities that vary across strike rates  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Why did we judge inflation and the economy to have become sufficiently robust as to allow a gradual end to net purchases?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.06,0)">Let me go back to the mechanics of securities purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The fundamental mechanism that has justified our outright interventions works through the market price of duration risk, which is the interest rate risk borne by price-sensitive investors in long-term bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Investors in long-term bonds require higher premia to bear the extra risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">This pushes up the long-term interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.7,0)">If the central bank wants to exert downward pressure on long-term interest rates, then it can absorb extra duration risk from the market by purchasing securities with a relatively longer maturity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">This frees up more risk-bearing capacity for investors, which they can re-deploy towards different types of risk, including investment in the real economy, which is a key channel of transmission to business investment and durable consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is worth remembering here that, for a central bank to set this mechanism in motion, it is the fact of holding a large portfolio of long-dated securities embodying duration risk that matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">These effects are complemented by the signalling channel that asset purchases imply for the path of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The bonds we have purchased will remain on our balance sheet for an extended period of time after the end of our net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">As a result, a substantial stock effect will continue to extract a sizeable amount of duration risk, even as the portfolio is set to increase at a much reduced pace until the end of December and is anticipated to remain constant thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">The roll-over of the portfolio will also continue to preserve adequate liquidity conditions, despite the decline in the volume of banks’ excess reserves that we anticipate will follow the expiration of our outstanding TLTROs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.15,0)">You can see this in the following charts, which show the term-premium compression that our portfolio is estimated to bring about across time   and the estimated evolution of excess liquidity over the period stretching beyond the maturity of the TLTROs  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Impacts are shown for different recalibration vintages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.26,0)">The marginal impact of each recalibration is given by the distance between the line referring to that vintage and the line referring to the vintage earlier in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In constructing the curves, the arbitrary assumption was made that reinvestments will be carried out until December 2020 and securities will be rolled over into a mix of securities in line with market neutrality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.27,0)">Latest observation: August 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.46,0)">Last observation: August 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">In June we judged that the withdrawal of duration risk was approaching levels at which, subject to underlying and external conditions evolving in line with our projections, a gradual slowing and an eventual end of net purchases would not hamper the return of inflation to our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.04,0)">However, announcing that we anticipated a gradual winding-down of our net purchases could have left expectations of our rate path unanchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The signalling that comes together with a quantitative easing programme was reinforced in our case by the Governing Council’s decision to tie the expected path of the policy rates to the end of the net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">From March 2016 until June 2018, we provided guidance on the likely timing of a rate lift-off by saying that we expected the key ECB interest rates “to remain at their present levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The adoption of this sequenced form of guidance turned out to be an important factor behind the reduction of uncertainty around the policy path that we have observed since March 2016  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.6,0)">Predicting at the June meeting what market participants would infer about future policy from the Governing Council’s announcements concerning its asset purchase plans – in other words, how investors would process the signalling implicit in such purchases – was particularly challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Had market participants drawn wrong inferences from the anticipated end to net asset purchases regarding the Governing Council’s rate expectations, this could have implied a more rapid increase in short-term interest rates than the Governing Council judged to be consistent with continued progress towards the policy objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.94,0)">This, in turn, could have had significant financial market repercussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.53,0)">The announcement could have destabilised expectations and sent shock waves through the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.76,0)">The attendant tightening in financial conditions could have driven the path of inflation convergence off course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Assessing “resilience” was therefore of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">There is the date-based element that interest rates are expected to remain at their present levels “at least through the summer of 2019”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">In addition, there is a state-contingent element that rates will remain unchanged “in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">As it turned out, our enhanced guidance on the rate path successfully kept the signalling channel of the APP communication under control  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The financial market reaction to the announcement was well aligned with the Governing Council’s rate guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">The latest surveys of market participants’ expectations regarding the most likely date for a lift-off indicate that the “at least through the summer” of 2019 formulation has been solidly internalised in markets’ risk-neutral expectations, although interest rate swap contracts price in the possibility that the first rate hike might be postponed somewhat beyond the summer of 2019, due to potential risks to the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.36,0)">We do not see this disagreement between economists – who participate as panellists in the surveys on rate expectations – and rank-and-file traders – who make the investment decisions underpinning the interest rate swap curve – as necessarily puzzling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">After all, our rate forward guidance has a time-based and a state-based element to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The rate guidance is thus framed in terms of an expected path of action, which is inherently probabilistic in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Accordingly, given our data-dependent approach to monetary policy, that path may change in line with the evolving investors’ assessment of the economy and the inflation outlook  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.35,0)">Of course, we are well aware that our portfolio, even if kept constant in euro amounts, will tend to lose duration over time, as the securities held in the portfolio will gradually mature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.98,0)">At some point in the future, this passive loss of duration in our securities holdings will begin to exert increasing upward pressure on the term premium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But this will happen only slowly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">And, in the more distant future, when the associated impact on long-term rates does eventually become significant, the measured tightening in financial conditions will be justified by the advanced phase of economic expansion which the economy will be enjoying at that point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Why is an ample degree of monetary accommodation needed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The ongoing economic expansion gives us confidence that inflation dynamics will strengthen in the period ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">However, underlying price pressures are building up only gradually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">So, the process of inflation convergence is expected to take time – meaning we have to be patient – and it remains contingent on a very substantial degree of monetary policy accommodation – meaning we have to be persistent in our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Prudence also remains paramount, as we need to ensure that our stimulus preserves the economic expansion amid the lingering uncertainties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We see the need for patience analysing the principal intersection between growth and inflation formation that is the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.63,0)">On the back of the economic expansion, which has been underpinned by our monetary policy, all of the job losses recorded during the crisis have been recovered and the unemployment rate is at its lowest level for nearly nine years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.42,0)">At the same time, the degree of slack in the economy remains uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">One reason for this is that productive capacities may have been positively affected by labour market reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.16,0)">In this context, non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment   estimates have been continuously revised downwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.42,0)">Moreover, narrow unemployment measures are likely to understate the prevailing degree of underemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.46,0)">Some employees would still like to work more hours, or move from temporary jobs to more permanent ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.21,0)">There also appears to be a considerable backward-looking component in wage-setting, as it is only now that the considerable negative contribution of past inflation developments to compensation per employee growth has started to wane, aided by the gradual pick-up in inflation expectations and the higher headline inflation numbers  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Overall, while there is growing evidence that labour market tightness is finally translating into a pick-up in wage growth, we have to remain patient for a more durable rise in wage growth to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Moreover, higher wage growth does not mechanically translate into higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.08,0)">There is evidence that the degree to which firms pass on rising costs in the form of higher prices depends on whether they perceive cost pressures to be persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">A more lasting increase in wages, fostered by persistent monetary policy accommodation, should gradually strengthen the transmission of rising wages to price inflation, thereby supporting the projected trajectory of inflation convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Contributions are derived as in Yellen, J.L.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">, “Inflation Dynamics and Monetary Policy”, Speech at the Philip Gamble Memorial Lecture, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, 24 September 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Conclusion The strength of the economy supports our confidence that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed and will be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">At the same time, uncertainties relating to rising protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility have gained more prominence recently, and an ample degree of monetary accommodation remains necessary to underpin the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Today’s term structure of money market interest rates, which is a key ingredient underpinning our projections of a gradual but consistent return of inflation to our aim in the medium term, embodies a very moderate pace of rate rises beyond the expected date of lift-off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As we move forward beyond year-end, that segment of the term structure will become the focus of market scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">In order for that segment to remain consistent with a continued gradual inflation convergence, our communication on policy adjustments beyond the first rate hike will become increasingly important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Prudence, patience and persistence remain the guiding principles for our monetary policy in order to provide the necessary degree of monetary accommodation and to support the gradual build-up of inflationary pressures to return inflation to levels below, but close to, 2% in the medium term in a durable fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">I would like to thank Fabian Eser for his support in preparing this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Bobeica, Ciccarelli and Vansteenkiste  , “The link between wage and price inflation in
