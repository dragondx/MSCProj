    <h2> Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB at the Project Europe 2.0 Institute of International & European Affairs Dublin, 25 September 2008 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Lorenzo Bini Smaghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)"> Celebrating 50 years of Europe Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB at the Project Europe 2.0 Institute of International & European AffairsDublin, 25 September 2008 Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to be here today to celebrate Europe’s 50th anniversary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">It’s quite nice to see that in Ireland anniversaries are still a reason for celebration 18 months after the effective date, although I’m not sure – judging from some recent polls – that in this country late celebrations are particularly beneficial to Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.49,0)">On the day after their 50th birthday most people tend to fall into a depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.96,0)">To avoid it, they first have a medical check-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Then they go on a diet and take up some new sport.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.69,0)">I know what it’s like.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I did it myself in the last couple of years!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.12,0)">One of the things I feared most, for my own future, was to be affected by so-called “cognitive dissonance”, a problem many people seem to develop as they grow older.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.59,0)">You start reminiscing about the “good old days” – but in reality they weren’t so good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.31,0)">You tend to remember only the nice things from your past, and see it all through rose-tinted glasses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.47,0)">As for the rest, well, you forget or suppress it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.0,0)">This is where nostalgia comes in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">People end up thinking that the past was much better than the present, and much more pleasant than the future will be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">They’d like to return to the past, their past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.5,0)">They become afraid of change and turn increasingly pessimistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.93,0)">It’s a terrible way to grow older!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.7,0)">At 50, Europe might be affected by this same syndrome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">It should come as no surprise, since about 36% of Europe’s population is over 50, and the proportion is rising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.71,0)">Europeans seem to be nostalgic about an irretrievable past and increasingly afraid of the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">They tend to see developments over the years in a way quite different from the reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.49,0)">One of the victims of this syndrome is the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.19,0)">The ultimate victims, however, might be Europeans themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I won’t elaborate on the theory of cognitive dissonance, but I will provide some examples of its symptoms and the potential implications for our common future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I’ll consider four symptoms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.64,0)">The first is amnesia; in other words, Europeans seem to have forgotten what the European Union is about  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.45,0)">The second symptom, derived from amnesia, is lack of consistency, which induces to create a link between facts and events that occur at the same time but which in fact are unrelated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.36,0)">The third symptom is myopia, which gives people a distorted view of the world around them, and thus the impression that nothing changes over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.66,0)">The fourth symptom is denial, in particular concerning people’s own vitality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.94,0)">* * * Let me start with the first symptom: amnesia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.26,0)">People tend to forget what the European Union is all about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.68,0)">It’s not even clear they ever knew enough about it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.91,0)">This is a long-standing problem and has never really been tackled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.86,0)">The fact of the matter is that our citizens have little idea of what the EU is and how it functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.0,0)">This lack of awareness can easily be exploited, and indeed has been exploited, to paint a distorted picture of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.92,0)">The picture that people have of the EU shows the Member States and the Union almost as opposing forces, rather than the former coming together to make up the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.07,0)">When the Union takes a decision, it somehow looks as if it was a third entity – “Brussels” – who took it, rather than representatives of the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.93,0)">In fact, the main decision-making body in the EU is the Council, which comprises representatives of the Member States, elected at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.88,0)">The same can be said about the Parliament, directly elected by the people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.14,0)">And also the Commission consists of persons appointed by the governments of the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">When the Union takes a decision, it is in fact the Member States which take it, through procedures established by the Union involving factors such as voting modalities and specific majority thresholds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.21,0)">When the Union fails to take a decision, it is ultimately the Member States which fail to do so, either because they don’t want to or because they don’t gain majority support for a proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.91,0)">The Union is often accused of excessive regulation and interference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.81,0)">Whose fault is it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.95,0)">It always seems to be the fault of Brussels’ bureaucrats, but they are not those who decide on regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.55,0)">They, at most, make formal proposals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.99,0)">It’s the governments and agencies of the Member States which ultimately are responsible for creating excessive regulation; they are the ones that add extra conditions to take into account national circumstances or create exemption or special regimes, which go beyond the requirements of EU directives when transposing them into national law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.33,0)">The confusion is compounded when accusations of overregulation come from those who attended the Council meeting that led to a particular decision, sometimes just afterwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.49,0)">Voting in favour of a measure in Brussels and then criticising that same decision once back home is a favourite sport.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">No surprise that European citizens are confused.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.04,0)">The Union is also often accused of immobility, of not being able to decide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.25,0)">But if the Union doesn’t decide it is because the Member States don’t decide, or more often, because the Member States don’t want the Union to take decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.56,0)">I will come back to this issue later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.61,0)">The other misrepresentation is about the competences of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.11,0)">They are much more limited than people generally think, but they are often at the heart of the misunderstandings and frustration that the Union creates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me be more concrete here, and give you some examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.85,0)">I understand that one of the reasons for some people voting against the Lisbon Treaty in this country was the fear that Brussels, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">the other Member States, would decide on taxation in Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It should have been clear that decisions on taxation cannot be taken without the unanimous consent of all the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.23,0)">These fears, and similar ones about transfers of specific powers, were thus unjustified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.63,0)">Overall, the range of the Union’s competences is quite restricted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.31,0)">In the economic sphere, for instance, with the exception of monetary policy, its competencies are limited to the coordination of the Member States’ policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.44,0)">Again, one of the issues raised in Ireland by the opponents of the Lisbon Treaty seems to have been the EU’s inability to deal with the economic problems facing ordinary people, in particular income and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The motto would be: “Europe is doing nothing to help us ou!t”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.2,0)">But protecting people’s income and livelihoods is a competence of the Member States, not the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">While it is certainly an objective of the Union to achieve high living standards and high employment, as the Treaty says, the instruments to achieve these objectives are in the hands of the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">People should know more about the competences which have been transferred to the Union, like monetary policy which is conducted by the European Central Bank, and those that have remained in the hands of the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.95,0)">The confusion, which is at times exacerbated by the Member States themselves, penalises the Union, which is perceived as being over-powerful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">One example is in the energy sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">In the face of the recent increase in energy prices and the overdependence of European countries on a limited number of suppliers, numerous calls have been made from all the corners of Europe in favour of a European energy policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.51,0)">But nothing has happened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.42,0)">When it came to taking decisions, the Member States showed no desire to hand over their powers in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.08,0)">The lack of a European energy policy is nevertheless seen as a failure of the Union, rather than of the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.16,0)">Europe is a complex construction, indeed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.0,0)">Its treaties, which are drafted as international legal documents rather than simple constitutional principles, are difficult to read.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.08,0)">This is inevitable and we should not pretend that citizens can easily understand them, when even some politicians cannot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.84,0)">However, what is more difficult to accept is that, after 50 years, some of the basic principles of how the Union functions and what its competences are remain poorly understood by our fellow citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.61,0)">Whose task is it to explain the basic facts about Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.55,0)">Should it be the role of European’s institutions, such as the Commission?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.45,0)">The Commission has small representative offices in each country, and most of the time they are busy trying to correct inaccuracies thrown in the national debates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The task of informing citizens about Europe can only be effectively undertaken by the Member States, which have well-established educational programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.7,0)">The results - unfortunately - speak for themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.27,0)">And this is not without consequences, also for the politicians of the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.51,0)">If the people of Europe don’t understand the Union properly, they won’t necessarily understand their domestic political situation any better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.28,0)">Indeed, polls show that even when the trust in European institutions declines, it remains in most cases well above the national ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.42,0)">In fact, some of the negative opinions expressed on the Union, including in electoral consultations, tend to reflect negative views about national politics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.95,0)">This is the worst of all worlds for the Union: being blamed for something it’s not responsible for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.0,0)">* * * Let me turn to the second symptom, which derives from the first one, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.22,0)">inconsistency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Over the last ten years the world economy has undergone substantial changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">I won’t list them all, but, to be sure, there has been a massive transfer of resources between and within countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The change in the terms of trade has led to a huge transfer of purchasing power from advanced economies to oil and commodity exporters while globalisation has brought considerable benefits to low-cost exporters of manufactured goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Just to give an estimate, the transfer of purchasing power due to the increase in oil prices alone amounts to around 3 trillion US dollars over the last decade, about 7% of advanced economies’ GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The period between 2002 and 2007 saw the world economy grow at its fastest rate since the 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">However, this has masked notable differences between advanced and emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">For the developing world, growth has been at its strongest since the Second World War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.84,0)">Advanced economies, on the other hand, have recorded a worsened performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.33,0)">For the United States, in particular, the last decade has been the worst, in terms of per capita income growth, for over 100 years, with the sole exception of the 1930s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.24,0)">Growth in Europe has also been quite modest compared with previous decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">A significant redistribution of income has also taken place within countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">In some advanced economies, notably the United States and the United Kingdom, the index of income inequality has risen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.67,0)">In general there has been a stagnation or even a tendency towards a reduction in purchasing power for the lower-income groups, as a result of weaker income growth and higher price increases for products such as food and energy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.83,0)">Income growth disparities reflect increasing differences in human capital, access to technology and educational levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.86,0)">Theory and past experience both suggest that competition from low-cost countries tends to penalise low incomes and employment advanced economies’ sectors with lower technological content.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The acceleration of technological change and the dismantling of barriers to trade have increased international competition and brought about adjustment in a much shorter time than expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.67,0)">Advanced economies have thus felt severe strains in the last decade, and we can observe the political and social implications on a daily basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The current US electoral campaign confirms that the issues are similar on both sides of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">With one difference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In Europe, the last ten years have also been marked by the birth of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.25,0)">And this is where the lack of consistency arises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The euro was created to bring about monetary stability in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">And this goal has been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Inflation is low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.17,0)">Interest rates are low, reflecting low inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The European Central Bank has acquired credibility by conducting a monetary policy aimed primarily at price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The euro has become the second international currency, trusted by investors all over the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The recent market turmoil should encourage us to think about what could have happened without the euro, in terms of speculative pressures within Europe, exchange rate variability and interest rate levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.88,0)">We would certainly have been worse off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.75,0)">Most Europeans tend to forget about the advantages they have acquired over the years, even those been gained only recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Being a member of the European Union and the euro area isn’t considered a big deal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.67,0)">On the other hand, many of the problems of everyday life are blamed on Europe or the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.56,0)">The euro is sometimes considered responsible for problems that have affected our economies in the last few years, such as the increase in housing prices, higher food and petrol prices, especially at the time of the cash changeover, and relatively subdued growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.72,0)">As I have just mentioned, these problems have been experienced not only in the euro area but in all advanced economies, including those that don’t have the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.96,0)">I would contend that some of the problems, such as inflation and income inequality, have been even greater outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.69,0)">It is nevertheless difficult to explain to citizens that events taking place at the same time in a country are unrelated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.82,0)">The euro is an easy scapegoat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.33,0)">Attributing the fault to the euro is an easy way for individuals and governments to avoid taking responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.48,0)">The confusion as to who’s responsible for what in the Union and the simultaneous occurrence of the euro’s creation and other events that took place in our countries in the last decade have led many people to be inconsistent in their assessment of what the euro – and Europe more generally – has achieved in all these years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.15,0)">* * * Let me turn now to the third symptom, myopia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.8,0)">The difficulty to fully understand the causal relationship between events affecting our societies and our own lives derives in part from a form of short-sightedness concerning the world around us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.39,0)">As we grow older we tend to think that the world is the same as it always was.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Maybe it’s a natural reaction to growing older.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.61,0)">But in fact the world around us is changing, in a way that affects our lives and our ability to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.46,0)">Europeans in particular have a tendency to think that the world hasn’t changed much over the last 10 to 20 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">More worryingly, they tend to believe that things won’t change much in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">In reality, change has been all around us and will accelerate further in many areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.9,0)">I won’t dwell on this issue, but the bottom line is that Europe is getting smaller and smaller, while other continents and economies are growing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">20 years ago the EU represented 28% of world GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.78,0)">In 2020, if recent trends continue, the figure could be less than 18%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.87,0)">Individual countries within Europe are also becoming smaller and less powerful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There is nothing new in this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.99,0)">50 years ago, the first President of the European Parliament, Paul-Henri Spaak, noted that “ Today, Europe consists solely of small countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.0,0)">The only relevant distinction that remains is that some countries understand this, while others still refuse to acknowledge it”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">20 years ago France and Germany together represented close to 10% of world GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Today this percentage is 7.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.92,0)">By 2020, if recent trends continue, it will be reduced to 5%, less than Germany alone 20 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Other regions and countries are emerging as major players, their size comparable to that of the whole European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Individual European countries are bound to have each a lesser role to play on the global arena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is already the case in trade, international finance, the environment, energy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">How long will it take for European countries to realise that, in terms of power, they have become close to irrelevant?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.53,0)">Paul-Henri Spaak’s words might lead one to think that this myopia affects only the larger countries of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This might be true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.66,0)">But smaller countries can suffer from another type of short-sightedness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.05,0)">Smaller countries are used to having a more limited role on the international scene.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.88,0)">They tend to leave major decisions to the larger countries, acting more as critical observers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">They can afford to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Indeed, the post-Second World War world has developed in an environment largely dominated by the United States, with the cooperation of European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The US influence shaped relations in the field of international finance, world trade and macroeconomic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The rules and policies pushed forward by the United States, and its leadership in implementing them, were broadly accepted by Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Even in the military field, the confrontation with the East took place under the protection of the US umbrella, even for countries that declared themselves neutral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.74,0)">In the coming years it will become more difficult for a single country alone, even the United States, to set standards and lead policies for the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.36,0)">The emergence of other regions and countries with larger populations and soon similar income to that of the United States will challenge its leadership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">International relations will have to be based increasingly on cooperation between equals rather than the leadership of one country, as they have been for the last 60 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">China, India and possibly also Brazil and Russia will play a greater role in global decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The key question in this scenario is: what will Europe, and European countries individually, do?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">They can ignore these developments and continue to act as followers of a leadership which will have become more varied, accepting the balance of interests that will have been agreed between the United States and the other systemically important countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.84,0)">They can continue to free-ride, but the outcome might be quite different and not quite as pleasant as it has been up to now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Alternatively, they can organise themselves and form a major player in the international community, possibly in partnership with the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">All European countries, not only the largest ones, will have to make this choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">To make Europe a key player will require the will of all its members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">My impression is that European citizens would be less frightened of the challenges of globalisation if they felt they could participate in its governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The problem is that globalisation can’t be controlled at the level of national governments, at least in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Europeans can participate in the governance of globalisation only if they stand united.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me give you an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The current financial market turmoil will have to lead to new financial regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In an increasingly integrated financial market, the new regulation and supervision will have to be the result of coordinated action on the part of major economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.82,0)">This will involve accounting rules, prudential regimes, the treatment of offshore centres and hedge funds, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The new rules will have to be discussed and agreed across the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The experience of the past few months suggests that the European contribution can be particularly useful in designing a more stable and prudent financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">To promote its views Europe has to organise itself to speak with one voice at the negotiating table.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.81,0)">If Europeans are divided, unable to take decisions, they will have to accept what’s decided elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.74,0)">Ultimately, speaking with one voice and taking decisions means deciding by   majority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.97,0)">It means that each member accepts being put in a minority by the others, as in a democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">It means, ultimately, increased political integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.59,0)">In other words, either European countries move towards increased political integration or they become irrelevant on major issues that are of relevance on the international scene.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It may sound a bit blunt, but at least it’s spelt clearly!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.47,0)">One objection to the choice of greater political integration is that some fundamental competences are inherent to nation states and cannot be given up without impairing the political integrity of those states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.27,0)">* * * This brings me to the fourth, and for now final, symptom which seems to be affecting some Europeans, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.41,0)">denial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.33,0)">As people grow older, the performance of certain functions – especially the more pleasant ones, which in some cases reflect power and potency – tends to be impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Science may to some extent help us to delay the slow but inevitable decay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.3,0)">On the other hand, it can also lead us into a dangerous state of denial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The same seems to apply to political power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.38,0)">As Europe and European countries grow older, and also smaller, they continue to deny the fact that their effective power is shrinking, if not disappearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.07,0)">For instance, many fora in which several European countries participate have lost relevance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.2,0)">And one of the reasons for this is that Europeans are over-represented in these fora, which reduces their legitimacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me give you the example of the International Monetary Fund where EU countries are represented in ten different constituencies, out of 24.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The euro area countries are spread over eight constituencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Some are even in constituencies in which all other countries are non-European; Ireland, for example, is in the same constituency as Canada and Caribbean countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.06,0)">Given the way Europeans are organised, it’s no wonder the IMF is largely influenced by the United States and that Europeans tend to punch much below their weight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Furthermore, major decisions concerning the IMF are increasingly taken in other fora, typically the G7 or the G20, where only the four largest European countries are represented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.39,0)">The EU is also a member of the G20, but given the rotating EU presidency, it isn’t able to have a substantial impact on the discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The most logical thing to do would be to pool European representation in the IMF and thereby obtain a power of veto like that of the United States so as to play a greater role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This would of course require some organisation within Europe to define a common policy, as is done for trade issues for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">As the IMF has become an institution focused primarily on surveillance of the world economy, I see no reason for European countries, especially those with a common currency, to have differing positions on the major issues discussed at the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">For example, I see no reason for a country such as Ireland to have positions more similar to those of Canada and the Caribbean countries than to those of other members of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.02,0)">If Europe had a single seat at the table, the national representatives that currently have a seat would have to leave it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">And they seem to be very attached to their seats, because they believe – or want to believe – that from this position they have been able to substantially influence decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.58,0)">They often don’t understand - or don’t want to understand - that as long as they are seated at the table, while others who matter more are not, that table is not really worth sitting at.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The main decisions will be taken elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.64,0)">Again, to give an example, the recent reform of the voting shares of the IMF, which by the way reduced the overall voting power of Europe, wasn’t really decided in the IMF Executive Board itself but agreed in other fora, most notably the G7 and the G20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.35,0)">Those who would have to leave their seat at the table are obviously in a state of denial, advancing quite absurd arguments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.12,0)">The oddest of all arguments against a single European seat is that it would create a polarisation in the governance of the Fund, with two major shareholders – the US and Europe – which would undermine its functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">As if a unipolar governance, with only one major shareholder  , is better from the perspective of any European country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">* * * I have talked enough today about symptoms and syndromes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.92,0)">Like anyone over 50, Europe needs to make sure it doesn’t become a hypochondriac.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As I mentioned at the start of my speech, Europe might need to go on a diet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And maybe get a new look.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.97,0)">The diet consists in streamlining activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.1,0)">The EU seems much fatter than it really is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.1,0)">European institutions should stop continuously looking for new roles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.31,0)">The celebration of the 10th anniversary of the euro ended with a series of recommendations, in particular from the Commission and the European Parliament, for new roles, but with no resources and no powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This gives the impression that the EU will have new competences, which is not true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The Union should instead clarify its role and show how slim it is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.69,0)">It should actually refuse to take on new tasks that Member States want to give it unless it explicitly receives the powers to conduct these tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">At 50, Europe also needs a new look.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.7,0)">Any book or film about Europe starts with a sequence of black and white pictures of the founding fathers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.36,0)">Most Europeans – unfortunately – don’t even recognize the faces of Schuman, Monnet, De Gasperi or Adenauer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This shouldn’t be surprising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.56,0)">They’d probably also fail to recognise the national politicians of those days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">History books are certainly useful, but pictures can be more effective than a thousand words.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">If I had to choose one picture to explain to current and future generations what Europe is about, I would take that of François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl joining hands in Verdun, in September 1984.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.33,0)">Some younger people might not recognise the two faces, but their act is unequivocal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Joining hands in front of a coffin explains everything about Europe, where we come from.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.57,0)">But that’s clearly not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The people of Europe need a better understanding of what the European Union is about, what it has given them and where it is going.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The Union should be seen not just as a grouping of states but as something helping the member states, and their citizens, to address the challenges of our times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The Union is not somewhere else – in Brussels or Strasbourg – it’s in every European town or village, whose prosperity depends on being part of a united Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The future of Europe depends on each of its 500 million citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But, more importantly, the future of the 500 million citizens depends on the future of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The best way to celebrate this 50th anniversary is to make sure that the best years are still to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Looking back on what has been done should strengthen our will and our confidence about what we can achieve in the future, together.</span>
