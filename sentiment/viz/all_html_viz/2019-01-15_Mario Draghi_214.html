    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)"> Debate about the Annual Report Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the European Central Bank, at the plenary debate of the European Parliament on the ECB’s Annual Report 2017, Strasbourg, 15 January 2019 Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Honourable Members of the European Parliament, I am very pleased to be here to discuss with you the ECB’s activities and your draft resolution on the ECB’s Annual Report 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">20 years ago, on 1 January 1999, the euro was officially introduced and the Eurosystem started its monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Establishing a single currency area between 11 European countries was a historic step for our continent and a quantum leap in economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Its twentieth anniversary gives us an opportunity to reflect on its successes, but also to consider what still needs to be done for the euro to deliver its full benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In this context, I would like to use my remarks to take a look back at the ECB’s monetary policy, to take stock of what we have learned and to highlight the challenges that remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I will mostly focus on the past seven years, which coincide with my term as ECB President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.1,0)">The evolution of the ECB’s monetary policy The two decades in which the euro has existed could hardly have been more different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">The first decade was the culmination of a thirty-year period of macroeconomic stability – the era known as the “Great Moderation”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.54,0)">The second decade then produced the worst economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.38,0)">Naturally, these periods required very different monetary policy responses and different tools to implement them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">As the pre-crisis period was characterised by moderate swings in the economic cycle,  the ECB was able to ensure price stability mainly by adjusting its policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.71,0)">But the crisis of 2008 fundamentally changed the economic and financial landscape in which the ECB operated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">New instruments became essential to safeguard the effectiveness of our monetary policy and stabilise the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">This in turn required us to refine our approach to central bank communication and accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.93,0)">When I arrived at the ECB in November 2011, the euro area faced a very challenging set of circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The economy had bounced back from the post-Lehman crisis in a similar manner to other jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.33,0)">But from 2010 onwards, a loss of confidence in the sustainability of sovereign debt had produced a vicious circle of rising borrowing costs, financial fragmentation, and contracting economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.37,0)">Cuts in key ECB interest rates were not being passed on to firms and households to the same extent in every euro area country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.17,0)">We were witnessing a serious disruption in the monetary policy transmission mechanism which, if left untended, would have posed a profound threat to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The ECB responded with two sets of policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">First, central bank liquidity was made available to banks for up to three years, and the range of collateral that banks could use to access central bank money was expanded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">This helped reduce fragmentation in banks’ funding conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Second, the ECB announced outright monetary transactions   in the summer of 2012, which removed redenomination risk in government bond markets stemming from fears of a possible euro area break-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.26,0)">Yet the sovereign debt crisis left a deep scar on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.69,0)">Unemployment rose steeply, firms cut back on investment and loan delinquencies increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.14,0)">Even though financial fragmentation was diminishing, banks began to shrink their balance sheets and became less willing to lend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.37,0)">This produced a renewed cycle of contracting credit growth and weak demand dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.01,0)">Inflation drifted downwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.48,0)">With inflation now well below our objective, the ECB faced a new type of policy challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">We needed not only to repair the transmission problems created by deleveraging banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">We also needed to expand our policy stance to counteract deflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">So in June 2014 we launched our targeted longer-term refinancing operations, which once more provided long-term liquidity to banks – but conditional on extending credit to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.68,0)">We introduced negative rates on excess reserves to further encourage banks to lend to households and businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">And soon after, we announced our asset purchase programme  , buying asset-backed securities and covered bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Faced with a continued decline in inflation and a heightened risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations, in January 2015 we expanded the APP to include public sector securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Since then, both the size and duration of our asset purchases have been recalibrated in response to changes in the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Our asset purchases have also been complemented by further cuts in policy rates and the use of forward guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Communicating our expectations about future policy, along with the conditions that would warrant a change in the policy stance, has successfully contributed to reducing uncertainty around the expected future path of short-term interest rates, thereby helping to preserve accommodative financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Supported by these policy measures, the euro area economy has steadily recovered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We have now seen 22 consecutive quarters of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.91,0)">There are 9.6 million more people in employment in the euro area than there were in the second quarter of 2013  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.35,0)">The unemployment rate has declined to 7.9%, its lowest level since October 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">And the employment rate of people aged 15-74 has risen from 54% in 1999 to 59% in the second quarter of 2018, the highest rate ever recorded in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The main motor of the recovery has been the domestic economy, driven by a strengthening in domestic demand and improving labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">That underlying strength of the economy has underpinned our confidence that inflation would converge towards our inflation aim in a sustained manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.05,0)">As such, since 2017 we have gradually reduced the monthly pace of net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.66,0)">We decided to end our net purchases in December last year, confident that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim would proceed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.56,0)">At the same time, recent economic developments have been weaker than expected and uncertainties, notably related to global factors, remain prominent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">So there is no room for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">A significant amount of monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of assets we have acquired, continues to provide the necessary degree of monetary accommodation for the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Lessons for monetary policy and the monetary union So what have we learned from this experience?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary framework rests on three elements: a clear mandate to achieve price stability; independence over the instruments we can use to achieve our mandate; and a strong accountability framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">The importance of each of these elements has been reinforced by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">First, we have seen that a well-defined mandate is vital for our credibility with the public, because it guarantees that the ECB will always act in the interest of the whole euro area, and will not be swayed by interest groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Second, we have seen that instrument independence is key to an effective monetary policy, since it allows the central bank to act quickly and flexibly to shocks, especially in exceptional times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Indeed, a well-equipped toolbox, comprising both standard and non-standard instruments, has proven indispensable in conditions where monetary policy transmission is impaired or where space for interest rate cuts is limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Third, we have seen the importance of a strong accountability framework, particularly when central banks have to use new tools that are not well-understood by the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.09,0)">Central banks are powerful and independent, but they are unelected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.72,0)">This combination can only be squared if they are held accountable by elected authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In light of this, we have stepped up our efforts to improve our communication and strengthen our accountability in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.8,0)">The Governing Council has started to publish the accounts of its monetary policy meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The ECB and the European Parliament have increased the intensity and focus of their exchanges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">All this has provided us with more opportunities to explain our decisions and demonstrate how the ECB is acting in accordance with its mandate, which is a fundamental pillar of its legitimacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The crisis has offered many lessons beyond monetary policy, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.4,0)">The euro area entered the crisis with an incomplete institutional and regulatory framework, not only for the banking sector but also in other areas of economic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The creation of the banking union and the European Stability Mechanism has strengthened the ability of EU authorities to intervene decisively in future crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Reforms at national level, and the strong political commitment to the euro shown by European policymakers, were equally instrumental in strengthening the foundations of our common project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">But the necessary changes took time, and it was time that the euro area lost in its recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Our monetary union is now in better shape, but further progress can and should be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">As I had the opportunity to discuss during my regular hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and as your draft resolution points out, the priority now is to increase the resilience of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">This would also strengthen the transmission of monetary policy in future downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Resilience depends on the euro area being able to use a broad policy mix involving monetary, fiscal, prudential and structural instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The first two decades of the euro area have seen an evolution in the way the ECB conducts its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Faced with unprecedented threats to price stability, the ECB adapted its policy instruments to continue delivering on its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">We will continue to do so if and when needed, in compliance with our mandate as defined by the EU Treaties, and with all the independence over our tools as defined by our legal framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.55,0)">Today, we can say that the euro area has emerged from a crisis so severe as to threaten at times its existence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">We are out of it, primarily because of the resilience, the energy, and the entrepreneurial capacity of European citizens, as well as their trust in their leaders’ commitment to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Our policy response and the important changes to the architecture of the EMU in the meantime also helped the euro area out of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In many ways we have a stronger monetary union today than we had in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">This is also reflected in the euro’s popularity among euro area citizens, which is currently at its highest level since it was introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">But more work is still necessary to complete the EMU, so as to make it more resilient in the face of future crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">To deliver its full benefits, the European Union requires permanent political commitment, at both national and European levels, and across policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">In this respect I can testify to the essential role the European Parliament has played during the challenging years of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">And I am certain that it will also be fundamental in carrying out the remaining work until the completion of the EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The credibility of the ECB rests on its independence and this is based on its accountability with respect to its mandate, as enshrined in the EU Treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The European Parliament in holding the ECB to account gives legitimacy to its independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">And since this is my last hearing before this plenary as ECB President, let me thank all of you for how this process has been carried out during my mandate, for the valued interactions with you, and the opportunity you have given me to explain the ECB’s policies.</span>
