    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)"> Youth unemployment in the euro area Keynote speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, for the Henry Grattan Lecture Series at Trinity College, Dublin, 22 September 2017 First, let me thank the Provost, Patrick Prendergast, for the warm welcome, Professor Gail McElroy for the introduction and indeed Trinity College Dublin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">I am happy to see my friend Philip Lane, Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We see each other in Frankfurt every other week so I am pleased to see him in a different setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It’s also nice to see my former colleague Patrick Honohan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">And a warm welcome to all of you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">I am especially honoured to speak here in Ireland for the first time and here in this prestigious, world-class institution, Trinity College, Dublin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Many of you are students, and to speak to young people who will carry today’s message into tomorrow’s world always entails a special responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">With it comes the honour of having been chosen to give this address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Your lives are being changed forever by the education of exceptional quality that you are receiving here, in a testimony to the history of Trinity, its birth, its glorious past and its distinguished alumni.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">I should especially acknowledge its extraordinary teachers, including Patrick Honohan, former Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, and his successor Philip Lane.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The Book of Kells, on permanent display here at Trinity, with its history and its beauty, reminds us of the importance of nurturing knowledge, spreading it throughout the world, and protecting it in times of peril.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It also tells us how important Ireland and its culture are for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It is well known how relevant the role of Irish monastic orders was in preserving our European cultural heritage in the early medieval period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">At the turn of the 7th century, St. Columban embarked on a journey across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">From the Atlantic to the Alps, he founded monasteries which were the centres of learning of his time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Along the way, he urged kings and commoners alike to adopt a notion of a European society rooted in the universal values of human life, the common good and education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Robert Schuman, a founding father of the European Union, honoured St. Columban in 1950, saying that “this illustrious Irishman who left his own country for voluntary exile, willed and achieved a spiritual union between the principal European countries of his time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">He is the patron saint of all those who now seek to build a united Europe.” It is with these thoughts in mind that I have chosen the topic of our meeting today: young people and the labour market in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.56,0)">Youth unemployment in the euro area Youth unemployment is not a recent phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">It was high over the last few decades, driven both by cyclical and long-term structural factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.77,0)">In Europe, the worsening labour market performance for young people became apparent in the 1970s, when unemployment increased from 4.6% to 11.1% by the end of the decade, partly due to the substantial increase in supply as the so-called baby-boomers entered the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.78,0)">But even when the size of this group declined, the relative labour market performance did not improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">There was some recovery in the early 1990s, but it never returned to the level of the early 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.37,0)">In 2007, when total unemployment in the euro area declined to 7.5%, its lowest level since the early 1980s, the unemployment rate for young people was already very high at around 15%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.03,0)">Youth unemployment is not just structural but also highly pro-cyclical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">During the Great Recession, and the corresponding cyclical downturn, youth unemployment surged markedly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Between 2007 and 2013, it increased by about 9 percentage points in the euro area – twice as much as the overall unemployment rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.31,0)">But euro area aggregates hide important differences across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.26,0)">Greece and Spain entered the crisis with youth unemployment rates of 23% and 18% respectively, and reached rates well above 50% by 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In Ireland, it tripled over the same period, peaking at 30%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.38,0)">In comparison, the youth unemployment rate in Germany, a country less affected by the cyclical downturn, declined from about 12% in 2007 to about 8% in 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.01,0)">What is the situation now?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The ongoing economic recovery in the euro area has led to improved labour market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Euro area real GDP has now grown for 17 consecutive quarters, creating in total over 6 million jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.46,0)">As a result, from its peak in 2013, the youth unemployment rate fell from 24% to around 19% in 2016, but is still about 4 percentage points higher than at the beginning of the crisis in 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.16,0)">In Ireland, where real GDP grew 5.2% last year, it declined by more than 13 percentage points from its peak, and is now below the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.85,0)">However, headline unemployment rates give only a partial picture of the labour market situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.25,0)">Many young people in the euro area are still in education or are not actively seeking employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.24,0)">The possible significant social and economic consequences are even more relevant if we look at new measures of labour utilisation, taking into account both unemployed people and those not involved in further education or training.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.53,0)">In 2016, around 17% of people between the ages of 20 and 24 in the euro area were neither in employment, education or training, with Ireland being close to this euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In Greece and Spain, the numbers are 23% and 21% respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.9,0)">The persistence and heterogeneity of youth unemployment across Member States point to continued underlying problems in labour market structures, with correspondingly high costs for our societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.39,0)">Long-term costs of youth unemployment Cyclical unemployment can turn structural if people remain unemployed for a long time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.0,0)">Protracted periods of unemployment can result in “scarring” effects, leading to a greater likelihood of future unemployment, human capital losses and lower earnings .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.26,0)">And this has negative effects not only on life satisfaction, but also on health, and may persist well into later life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.94,0)">The sense of detachment that is produced by prolonged unemployment has been well documented in several social experiments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.75,0)">With a large proportion of young people not having any defined role in society  , there is a high risk of social cohesion and of trust in public institutions being undermined, with harm for medium-term growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.6,0)">Youth unemployment is also costly in terms of long-term productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">High-productivity firms, particularly in their early expansion phase,  are more likely to hire young people because that group will help them to become more innovative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Innovation is driven, among other things, by curiosity and creativity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The fact that young people are more curious requires no further explanation; the teachers among you or those of you with children or grandchildren are well aware of that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.47,0)">When it comes to creativity, age plays a crucial role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Creativity can be measured, for example, by the number of original and valuable contributions to fields such as science and art.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.63,0)">By that measure, output first increases in our mid-20s, reaches a peak when we are in our 30s or early 40s, and then undergoes a slow decline as we age .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">So to foster innovation, it is very much in the interest of firms to recruit young people .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The young are also in a better position to facilitate knowledge diffusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In this regard, labour mobility is key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.46,0)">During the early years of their careers, young workers, in the search for a better job, move more frequently between professions and assignments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.46,0)">As we get older we change jobs less often: at the age of 40 we switch half as much as we do at 20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The mobility of the young is likely to facilitate an efficient allocation of labour through higher job-to-job transitions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">And this mobility across firms and sectors, and sometimes across regions and countries, contributes to the diffusion and expansion of knowledge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">For these reasons, youth employment and productivity growth create a virtuous circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.15,0)">When firms become more productive they are more likely to employ young people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">And when young people have such opportunities, they can capitalise on their skills, adding to productivity growth, which among other benefits for society will lead to higher wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.38,0)">Youth unemployment breaks this virtuous circle: it is a drag on innovation and impedes knowledge diffusion by decreasing mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.86,0)">Additionally, unemployment prevents experienced workers and young workers from interacting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.07,0)">The experienced ones don’t benefit from insights and knowledge of the young.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And they, in turn, don’t gain from the know-how of more experienced workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.31,0)">The role of policies As we have seen, there are cyclical and structural reasons for the high rates of youth unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Demand-side policies, such as fiscal and monetary policy, can help to address cyclical fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Our monetary policy measures, aimed at maintaining price stability, are supporting domestic demand and thus the recovery in employment, from which also younger generations of Europeans are benefiting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Furthermore, we should not forget that the crisis was a financial crisis, and therefore financial policies are also essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">It is important to further improve the resilience of the financial system by strengthening sectoral balance sheets, and having an appropriate financial regulatory and supervisory framework, and a robust macroprudential policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.35,0)">But the rise in youth unemployment has also deeply rooted structural reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">The persistence and heterogeneity of youth unemployment rates across the euro area countries even before the crisis, as well as the diverse developments during the crisis, indicate that there is need for specific policies to improve education and labour market functioning in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Higher levels of education are positively correlated with both greater labour market participation and lower unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.65,0)">The risk of losing a job is significantly higher for people with low educational attainment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.02,0)">And this group was severely hit by the crisis, with their unemployment rate increasing from about 11% in 2008 to 21% in 2013 in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.44,0)">The pattern is similar for young workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.4,0)">For example, in Ireland the unemployment rate of young people with an educational attainment below lower secondary education was 27.5% in 2016, while for young people with tertiary education it was about 11%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Acquiring a good skill set at school and university is therefore essential for a young person to find work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">However, skill mismatch indicators – which quantify the difference between skills wanted and skills offered – still remain at elevated levels, with only a slight moderation compared with the record levels at the height of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.35,0)">But skill mismatches are not just a consequence of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">In fact, they started to increase before the crisis because of structural changes related to digitalisation and globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.67,0)">The skill mismatch index for the euro area labour market in 2007 was almost twice as high as it was in 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There is also large heterogeneity across the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.62,0)">The OECD’s Survey of Adult Skills shows that while young adults in, for instance, Finland and the Netherlands perform well in problem-solving in technology-rich environments, in other countries they score significantly lower and youth unemployment is correspondingly higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.52,0)">Furthermore, the correlation between PISA scores and youth unemployment in the euro area is strong and negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.15,0)">The percentage of the working age population that has completed upper secondary or tertiary education ranges widely in the euro area – from a high of more than 90% in some countries to a low of around 40% in others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The need for improving skills has also been confirmed by the results of an ad hoc ECB survey of leading euro area businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The survey revealed that over 90% of businesses strongly supported reforms geared to enhancing the quality of education and training.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">These factors were deemed particularly relevant in the light of shifts towards knowledge-intensive skill sets, digitalisation and given long-standing structural deficits in engineering skills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Other non-tertiary education, such as the dual training and apprenticeship systems which we have in some euro area countries, has also been shown as helping to facilitate the transition from school to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In particular, Austria and Germany have been successful in keeping youth unemployment low mostly because of their efficient use of vocational training and programmes targeted at disadvantaged youth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The employment prospects of the young also depend on the existence of efficient labour market institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.4,0)">The vocational education system, together with more flexible wage setting, and stronger public support for helping the unemployed to seek and find jobs, as well as lower labour market segmentation explain in part why the youth unemployment rate is lower in Germany than in France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.71,0)">Furthermore, labour market rigidities decrease both inflows into and outflows from employment, and tend to reduce hiring of the young, especially during recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.31,0)">In dual labour markets, it is typically young workers that have temporary contracts and that shoulder much of the burden of adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.86,0)">Segmentation of the labour market and poor vocational training are also among the main reasons for the persistent high level of youth unemployment in several countries that have been hit severely by the recession such as Greece, Spain, Italy and Portugal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The role of Europe Europe’s role in addressing the problem is primarily defined by its Single Market that has removed many barriers to the free movement of goods, people, services and capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Indeed, the Single Market fosters competition among firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In the long run, firms’ competitiveness is not only determined by pricing, but also by other product features that meet customer demands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Knowledge and innovation of products and processes are therefore essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The Single Market requires firms to be more productive, so that they activate the virtuous circle between productivity growth and youth employment that I described earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">And indeed, the countries that have a high degree of openness and have benefited most from the Single Market, are also those with lower youth unemployment .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Therefore, also to support youth employment and incomes, the first and most important policy decision at European level is to complete the Single Market in all its dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">But to fully reap the benefits of openness, the Single Market needs to be embedded in supportive policies and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.31,0)">Competition not only creates opportunities for some firms to expand, it also drives others out of business and displaces workers in entire industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">It is therefore essential that those workers are supported when resources are channelled towards more productive firms or sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Protecting people, rather than jobs, means ensuring that they have or will acquire the necessary skills to be employed in other more productive parts of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Today much of this support falls under the competence of Member States, but also the EU can build on existing instruments, such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the European Social Fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">There is a second way in which European integration can support youth employment: by fostering the exchange of ideas and knowledge as researchers, students, and technologies move across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I am sure that many of the students here have been on an Erasmus exchange, or have come from other European countries to study here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">There is clearly a European dimension to education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">And Europe can contribute by investing in such exchanges as well as more broadly in the advancement of science.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The new Erasmus+, which now offers more opportunities for learning and training, is thus a welcome development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">And the Bologna Process makes it easier for young people to work in another EU country by facilitating the recognition of qualifications across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Moreover, the Youth Guarantee programme provides welcome support to the commitment by Member States to ensure that young Europeans under the age of 25 receive a good quality offer of employment, training or continued education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.92,0)">Labour mobility is often, when undesired, the result of poor cyclical and structural labour market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is those conditions that should be addressed in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The completion of the Single Market, the continuing progress in European integration and the deepening of our Economic and Monetary Union, will further expand the opportunities for young people beyond borders, and job matching possibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Labour mobility across countries and sectors is bound to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">This will require adequate supranational policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In some countries, and Ireland is one of them, some progress in reducing youth unemployment has been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">More generally, the strengthening of the recovery in the euro area will continue to reduce its extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">But to address structural causes of youth unemployment, a uniform degree of protection among workers, flexible labour arrangements, effective vocational training programmes, high degree of trade openness, and support to reduce the social cost of mobility are all necessary conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">I have highlighted the economic reasons that make addressing youth unemployment an invaluable undertaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">But there is a more fundamental reason to continue addressing this challenge with determination and as a priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.69,0)">We have seen how in several countries the weight of the crisis has fallen disproportionately on the young people, leaving a legacy of failed hopes, anger and ultimately mistrust in the values of our society and in the identity of our democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Some say that a more equitable distribution of income and wealth is the answer and that it would bring those who have lost out from globalisation back into our compact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But that cannot be enough for the young people who are the future of our democracies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.69,0)">They do not want to live on subsidies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">They want to work and expand their lifetime opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Today after the crisis, governments know how to respond to their quest, and how to create an environment where their hopes have a chance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">They should do so: for the future of their countries’ youth and of their democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.69,0)">and D.G.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.96,0)">Blanchflower  : Young People and the Great
