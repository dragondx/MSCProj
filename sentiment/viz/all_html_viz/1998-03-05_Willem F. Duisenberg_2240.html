    <h1> The euro and the process of European integration </h1>
    <h2> Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the Seventh Bernard Mandeville Lecture in Rotterdam - the Netherlands, 5 March 1998 (translated from the original Dutch) </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.31,0)"> The euro and the process of European integration Speech delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, at the Seventh Bernard Mandeville Lecture in Rotterdam - the Netherlands, 5 March 1998   Mandeville, after whom this series of lectures is named, emphasised even before Adam Smith that individuals who strive for their own interests may unintentionally bring something about which is in the interests of all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">He can thus be seen as one of the founders of the philosophy behind the market mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">What is required to make this market mechanism function properly is a set of institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">A healthy currency unit and a central bank to watch over it belong to this group of necessary institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.32,0)">The question as to the extent to which institutions can be designed, or rather must be the result of a spontaneous, evolutionary process of individuals striving for their own interests, is a fundamental issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Mandeville would tend towards the latter view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I am, as you know, no philosopher, so I will not attempt to formulate a fundamental answer to this fundamental question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Intuitively, or if you prefer, amateurishly, I am inclined to think that this is not a simple matter of 'either... or', but that both approaches can play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.63,0)">Any other response would sound strange coming from the President of an institution which has the singular task of designing new institutions - the euro and the European Central Bank - and making them work to everybody's satisfaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">These opening remarks bring me straight to the matter in hand: the huge institutional change in monetary affairs in Europe which is now at hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">1998 is an important year for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This year - in eight weeks' time to be precise - the decision will be taken as to which countries will introduce a single currency, the euro, on the first of January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In just three weeks’ time the decision-making process will start formally with the publication by the European Monetary Institute and the European Commission of reports assessing the progress made by the various countries with regard to economic convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The European Commission will attach a recommendation to its report as to which countries are ready for the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The European Parliament will publish an opinion and national parliaments will also debate the selection issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">All this will culminate in the first weekend in May, first in a recommendation by the Finance Ministers, and the same weekend, in the decision by the Heads of State or Government on the participating 'euro countries'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Subsequently, bilateral exchange rates will be announced against which the currencies of the euro countries will be converted to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.36,0)">With the appointment of the members of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, according to the Treaty of Maastricht, this institution will be established, and 'my' institution, the European Monetary Institute, will go into liquidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">This will presumably take place around the end of May and beginning of June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Up to the end of the year, the ECB will prepare the actual introduction of the euro and the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I see the introduction of the euro in a broad perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The introduction of the euro and the associated single European monetary policy are not isolated steps, but a part - albeit a very important one - of the process of European integration which effectively started immediately after, or even perhaps during, World War II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Thus it is a process, and a process which involves more than just economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.02,0)">Economists very often analyse the euro simply in economic terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There is nothing wrong with this, because the economic aspect is important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.67,0)">However, what is objectionable is that people all too often draw conclusions about the euro based on purely economic arguments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.67,0)">Thus one loses sight of the broader context of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.89,0)">Before I come to that, there is another mistake which is often made and has to do with taking too narrow a view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is that people often point to the risks of the introduction of the euro on the implicit assumption that the alternative to European Economic and Monetary Union, hereafter referred to as 'EMU', is an everlasting and risk-free continuation of the world as we know it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.64,0)">That is not so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">EMU is not without risk, but nor is the alternative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is easier to appreciate this if we look at EMU in a broader context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The background to the process of European integration is, as I see it, above all organising Europe in such a way that the great conflicts of this century, two world wars, do not recur in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">One way of achieving this is to incorporate Germany into a European structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.54,0)">Without this policy, ultimately all problems confronting Europe directly or indirectly would end up on Germany’s plate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.68,0)">That would force Germany into a leadership role, which we do not want, and Germany no longer wants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">As Thomas Mann put it, and others have repeated: it is a choice between a European Germany or a German Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">European integration is the choice of Europe, including Germany, as the first alternative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The great changes which took place in eastern Europe almost ten years ago reinforced the need for European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.36,0)">The almost automatically unifying element of the confrontation with Communism thereby disappeared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The position of unified Germany was potentially, and in the long term, stronger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Germany not only became larger: through the developments in the east it also came to occupy a more central position in Europe, as it were.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.95,0)">In addition to this motif there is another motif, which is narrower and also has an economic component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This is the advance of the de facto German monetary hegemony over the last decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.54,0)">The Deutsche Bundesbank in effect largely determines the levels of interest rates in other European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">And however successful those countries may have been, partly as a result, in achieving price stability, larger countries in particular cannot in the long term accept being tied to Germany’s apron strings in monetary matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.16,0)">A European Central Bank places monetary policy within a European framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In this way, it is an example of the movement from a German Europe to a Europe in which Germany is included.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">To this end, Germany is prepared to replace the Deutsche Mark with the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This should not be judged lightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.63,0)">Germany is thereby, of its own volition, giving up a symbol, I would even say the symbol, of successful German policy since World War II, and relinquishing economic and administrative power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.2,0)">In this light it is quite understandable that Germany has continually asked for guarantees and makes repeated pleas for a stable euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The process of integration in Europe is always, first and foremost, managed by means of the economic component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Integration may be expected to have a positive effect on prosperity: this is clearly documented in economic theory; but we can also expect that common economic interests will make conflicts less likely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">European integration started with the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community in the early fifties, intended above all to remove two of the major constituents of heavy military armament, energy and iron, from national or, if you will, nationalistic decision-making, and has proceeded step by step to the Single Market programme and now to the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The euro can be seen as the final piece in the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.42,0)">Failure to introduce the euro could put this in jeopardy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.79,0)">After all, one should not underestimate the extent to which depreciation of the currency can again lead to a flare-up of protectionist 'counter-measures'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The Single Market only operates well if there is sufficient exchange rate stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In a Europe with free movement of capital it is no longer possible to guarantee this by means of a system of stable but adjustable exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.01,0)">Such systems have proved vulnerable and can fall prey to speculative attacks, which may be unwarranted by the underlying economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Even the traditionally super-strong link between the Dutch guilder and the Deutsche Mark is not permanently assured without EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">However, the process of integration will not be completed with the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The process of European integration will also continue because many countries in central and eastern Europe will wish to join the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The accession of these countries can only take place in stages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The introduction of the euro is the last stage, which must not be forced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">First, these countries must integrate their economies solidly into the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Then participation in the new exchange rate mechanism can follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Ultimately, the euro can be introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The prospective entrants will have to meet the same requirements as the countries which will introduce the euro at the start of next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">That will take considerable time - time which must also be used to consider any changes in the working methods of the ESCB if that is to consist of between 20 and 30 national central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.75,0)">There are issues here which may be even more difficult than the decision concerning which countries will participate on the first of January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It would be advisable to consider these matters in good time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.61,0)">This would prevent the man in the street and politicians alike later being caught off guard and feeling overtaken by events, as often seems to be the case in European debates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">How must the process of European integration be judged on the basis of its own objectives, as I have just formulated them?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">I say: positively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Participating countries have now known peace for more than 50 years and much has been achieved in the economic field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.05,0)">Of course I am not deaf to all criticism, nor unaware of friction among Member States, and the failures that sometimes occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">I also recognise that the next step, the introduction of the euro, is not without risk and undoubtedly there will be problems to be overcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Whatever else it may be, it will not be dull.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">However, my attitude is that taking this step offers great opportunities and that the risks are manageable, as long as one is not blind to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.52,0)">To break off the process of European integration at this point - which is what failure to introduce the euro would mean - would throw Europe into great confusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.96,0)">No viable political alternative exists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Why, therefore, the introduction of EMU and the euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">First of all because of the political reasons discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.17,0)">They are no less important than economic reasons, nor is there any reason for economists to sneer at them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Peace and security can also be analysed in economic terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I would add the footnote that the introduction of the euro will not automatically have an integrating effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.61,0)">Some people feel that it will actually increase the potential for conflict, not only between those who are in and those who are out, but between those who are in, among themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">I am not that pessimistic, but I am convinced that the euro can only contribute to political integration if all EU countries have the prospect of joining EMU, and if the countries which have joined demonstrate the political will to accept that the introduction of a single currency and a single monetary policy means that interest rates must be brought to the level which is best for the entire euro region and not for individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The introduction of the euro also has clear economic advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">It removes the uncertainty over exchange rates from a large part of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">That is good for trade, and particularly for countries such as the Netherlands, which conduct a great deal of trade within Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">It increases the transparency of the European market, which makes it easier to benefit from economies of scale, but - or rather, in addition - it encourages competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The European System of Central Banks will also try to bring about price stability over a large area which, if successful, will be an important condition for a sustainable, real   growth in income and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The economic advantages of EMU increase in proportion to the size and stability of the euro region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Perhaps it is ironic that the advantages are greater the more countries which have in the past had long periods of stability problems are included in a stable EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The art, of course, is to combine size and stability as well as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This does not detract from the fact that risks may emerge and questions may be raised and that we must be prepared to learn from experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">That is why EMU is not the end of the process of integration, but the start of a learning process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In the rest of my lecture I would like to discuss a number of frequently raised issues and fears, without of course, making any claim to completeness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.53,0)">One of the first views expressed is that unemployment is too high for the European Central Bank to give top priority to achieving price stability, as the Treaty of Maastricht does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.2,0)">This attitude is based on a - sadly persistent - misunderstanding, which is that unemployment in Europe can be solved by lax monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.09,0)">However, unemployment in Europe is primarily a structural phenomenon, which requires measures to allow markets to function better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The best contribution monetary policy can make to growth and employment is to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.77,0)">Artificially stimulating employment by means of lax monetary policy does not lead to lasting low levels of unemployment, but ultimately it does lead to higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.2,0)">In that sense, it is a policy of shooting oneself in the foot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.83,0)">Another issue is why the European System of Central Banks has been made so independent of politics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.18,0)">Does that not mean that monetary policy has insufficient democratic legitimacy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Making the central banks independent is a world-wide trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This is prompted by the realisation that monetary policy can have a direct effect on growth and employment in the short term, but only directly affects inflation in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">There is always a temptation to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.63,0)">The growth in employment - later shown to be artificial - and the consequent improvement in election prospects come first, inflation and economic instability come later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Politicians recognise the seductive call of these sirens and they want to avoid giving in to this strong temptation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Therefore, they allow themselves, like Odysseus, to be bound to the mast by giving an independent central bank the task of ensuring price stability as its sole purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.09,0)">In practice, this construction causes tension on one point, or, to stay with Homer, has one Achilles' heel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.38,0)">In the short term it is true that monetary policy affects growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.29,0)">This makes the conduct of policy very delicate and the reading of the economic situation very precarious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.9,0)">The conduct of policy will also depend on the state of budgetary policy and on wage developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.63,0)">This all leads to a desire in society to call the central bank to account for the choices it has made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.39,0)">This is understandable and, in my opinion, justifiable, but one has to be careful not to throw the baby of independence out with the bathwater of accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.92,0)">After all, the fact that monetary policy only has short-term effects on growth and employment is the very reason for placing the central bank at a distance from politics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.47,0)">The desire for accountability must not run over into exerting pressure on the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">My conclusion for the European System of Central Banks is that monetary policy must be as transparent as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">That means that the ESCB must always make clear in word and deed how it sees the situation and that it explains its measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">To the public and to politicians; to governments and parliaments; to the European Council of Ministers and to the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It also means that the ESCB must quantify precisely what it understands by price stability and must announce in advance what its target is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.47,0)">The target itself must be clearly formulated and any deviation must be explained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Transparent monetary policy is not only important, and perhaps not even primarily important, in terms of the accountability of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It can also promote the efficiency of policy by creating the right expectations in the participants in the economic process concerning what the monetary authorities hope to achieve: monetary policy must be predictable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">This contributes to achieving stable prices with as little friction as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The ESCB is a system for the entire euro region and that must be manifest in the communication of its decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The remark that the ESCB is for the entire euro region also means that not all communications need pass exclusively via the centre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The national central banks can also play a useful role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">They can communicate in their own language, taking into account the particular circumstances of their own country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">The point is that communication should be carried out consistently throughout the euro region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.76,0)">It is crucial that the Eurotower in Frankfurt, the seat of the ECB, does not become an ivory tower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The ESCB must be open to contact with politicians, both sides of industry and parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In these contacts it must not only provide explanations but also be a good listener.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The sine qua non is that the independence of the ESCB should be respected in these contacts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The democratic legitimacy of the ECB is based on the fact that its duties are laid down in law, that the members of its Executive Board are appointed by elected politicians and that it offers explanations and is accountable in various ways for its analyses and the measures based on them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.61,0)">Admittedly this does not go as far as in politics, since those to whom it is accountable cannot impose any sanctions on the ECB, but that is just an inevitable consequence of opting for independent decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">And that is a choice which was made for good reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Another frequently asked question is: have the economies in Europe really converged sufficiently to be able to implement a single monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.18,0)">This is the key question, and it is not easy to answer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I do not agree with those who say that the creation of the right institutions is enough for the creation of a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">My vision is closer to the economic theory of optimum currency areas, which says that certain conditions must be met if an area is to introduce a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These conditions are not automatically met by introducing a single currency and setting up the right institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">The latter can help, it is true, but it is not sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">It is therefore right that convergence criteria in the areas of inflation, long-term interest rates, exchange rate stability and government deficits and debt were formulated in the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.46,0)">I do not deny that these criteria are, to a certain extent, arbitrary, almost by definition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.93,0)">Economic theory cannot come up with precise quantitative criteria to establish the viability of a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It will always require a certain amount of political will, and there will always be a certain amount of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.47,0)">The convergence will never be perfect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.14,0)">Therefore, the decision about the introduction of EMU is ultimately also a political decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">How is economic convergence going in Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">You will appreciate that I will not talk about individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In general, however, one may say that in many areas good, sometimes even remarkable, progress has been made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">With regard to inflation and long-term interest rates, 14 of the 15 Member States already clearly meet the criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Also, over the last few years there has been a remarkable degree of exchange rate stability between the European currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.8,0)">Finally, government deficits and debt: there are still countries in a situation in which a sound analysis is required under the terms of the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This requires that a multitude of factors be taken into account, such as medium-term economic and budgetary prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The EMI will produce the said sound analysis in the report to be published on 25 March.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The European Commission will also publish a report, as I said earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The decision will ultimately be taken by the Heads of State or Government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.83,0)">Although it is thus too early to draw conclusions, one thing is certain: among the participants in EMU there will be a large number who will have their work cut out in the next few years in the area of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.47,0)">But that would have been equally true without EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Politicians are well aware of this: in the 'Stability and Growth Pact’ they agreed to endeavour to achieve budgetary positions that are close to balance or even in surplus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">A question which is linked to the previous one is whether labour and product markets in Europe really have the necessary flexibility to cope with the introduction of a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.02,0)">This is a pertinent question, which arises from the idea that the official convergence criteria are not complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There is a risk here and also a role for policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The role of policy will be to go further towards allowing markets to operate more flexibly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.96,0)">Politically, this is not an easy matter, since it requires painful measures, the effects of which are not immediately perceptible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">However, I would stress that this policy is necessary not only to ensure the smooth operation of EMU, but also to solve the biggest economic problem in Europe, namely high unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Thus it is a double-edged sword: what is good for EMU is also necessary for the solution of the unemployment problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.99,0)">Another, related, question is: How can the euro countries adapt to economic setbacks which only affect them, or affect them more than other countries  , now that they can no longer use the instrument of devaluation and aim for a lower interest rate than other countries?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.93,0)">This question is related to the previous one, and the answer is thus in part the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">One way of addressing this type of shock is to let wages and prices react flexibly to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">In addition I would point out that the appropriateness of the exchange rate as a mechanism for absorbing country-specific shocks must not be exaggerated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.27,0)">Devaluations only work if the workforce does not translate the resulting price rises into wage rises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.65,0)">If it does, as has often been the case historically, the result of devaluing a currency is simply higher inflation, and postponement of the inevitable adjustment to changed circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This does not detract from, indeed it emphasises, the importance of adequate adjustment mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">High mobility of labour is, I believe, unlikely to play any great role in Europe for the time being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.95,0)">The language barriers in particular are too high for that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In addition to flexibility of wages and prices, the design of EMU also provides for another important adjustment mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The Stability and Growth Pact encompasses this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">By keeping their budgetary positions roughly in balance in normal circumstances, governments create a margin to deal with disappointing economic trends without having to make cut-backs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.99,0)">Allowing the deficit to increase in such circumstances automatically counterbalances the economic problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Of course, the ceiling for the deficit in the Maastricht Treaty must not be exceeded, except under truly exceptional circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We are talking here about the familiar 3% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The margin this provides should not be underestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">For the Netherlands it represents more than NLG 20 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This budgetary mechanism is not only available for country-specific shocks, it also helps to soften the blow of unfavourable trends affecting the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.25,0)">The existence of this mechanism at national level makes loan financing at European level to offset country-specific shocks superfluous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.7,0)">National budgets can only fulfil their shock-absorbing role if they really are close to balance under normal circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.83,0)">If not, then the shock is not absorbed, but hits the 3% safety rail prematurely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">In view of the level   of many government deficits at the moment, one must inevitably conclude that government deficits must continue to be reduced in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The next issue I want to address is whether monetary union can exist without political union, or whether we need a budgetary counterpart to the ESCB?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">It is undoubtedly true that the establishment and functioning of a monetary union is easier if at the same time there is also a political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.5,0)">There is then a single budgetary authority for the single monetary authority to deal with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It also simplifies the creation of a basis for monetary policy which by its very nature is single and indivisible in a region where developments will never quite be synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.24,0)">However, in reality Europe is not at that stage, or has not yet reached that stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Yet there are provisions in the Treaty, subsequently elaborated further, for example in the Stability and Growth Pact, which aim to create the conditions under which a monetary union would be workable without a political union in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Think, for example, of the relationships, formal and informal, which are envisaged between the European Council of Finance Ministers, ECOFIN and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">These relationships aside, the Stability and Growth Pact is an initiative to ensure that budgetary policy does not cramp the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">By reducing and practically eliminating government deficits, this can be guaranteed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.59,0)">The Pact is rather vaguer about assessing the budget situation in the euro region as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.03,0)">It is conceivable that the sum of the budget balances, while individually in line with the Stability Pact, could produce an overall result which is unsatisfactory - for example, where the euro region as a whole has a balance of payments deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Then further co-ordination of the budgetary policies of the individual countries might be necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.05,0)">In any case, such a situation is not an immediate concern, since the euro region is expected to have a modest balance of payments surplus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">All in all, there are sufficient channels for co-ordination and the exchange of information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.42,0)">Much will naturally depend on how these are used in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.24,0)">The agreements which have been made so far are not necessarily the last word.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">We will have to learn from experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Further evolution may take place on the basis of that experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.42,0)">Now I come to the last question: Will the ESCB pursue too tight a monetary policy just to establish its credibility?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">An easy one for a change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This fear is unfounded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The ESCB must pursue whatever policy is necessary to achieve and maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Don’t forget that this is laid down in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Taking an extra-strong line would not contribute to the realisation of this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The point is to strike the correct balance between inflationary and deflationary risks, and to set interest rates in such a way that price stability is the most likely outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.75,0)">Monetary policy is partly an art.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.59,0)">Monetary policy decisions cannot be taken mechanically; they can't be calculated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.93,0)">That is nothing new, but certainly at the start of EMU, when the financial sector will be in transition, predicting economic trends and the effect of policy measures may be more difficult than usual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.45,0)">In this context, it is very important that inflation rates in many European countries currently are not only close together, but also low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.36,0)">Inflation in the European Union is running at less than 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Many European national central banks consider this level to be in keeping with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.6,0)">Complete absence of measurable inflation is not required, because the measurement of actual inflation is beset by errors, on balance on the positive side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">If this situation can be maintained until January 1999 - and that is the objective of the current policy - then the ESCB will be able to start its work under favourable conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.25,0)">Tight monetary policy from the outset of the single currency will then be unnecessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I draw three conclusions: EMU must be seen as a process in a broad economic and political context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">EMU is not the end of this process, but another step on the way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">EMU offers economic and political opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However, there are also risks, and the opportunities must not be passed up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Political will, sensible economic policy and the will to learn from experience are essential conditions for making EMU a success.</span>
