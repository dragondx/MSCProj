    <span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)"> Restoring confidence in the euro area Remarks by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Festival dell’Economia, Trento, 1 June 2012 Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank Tito Boeri and Lucrezia Reichlin for their invitation to this sharing of views on how to restore growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.14,0)">Central banks are not central to delivering long-term economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Long-term growth is about education, innovation and the functioning of markets, none of which is really in our hands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">We can nevertheless contribute by providing stability – in particular, price stability, which is at the heart of our mandate, as well as confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.86,0)">Let’s face it: the euro area today lacks both stability and confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.05,0)">Price stability has been achieved and the ECB will strive to maintain it, but financial markets are under strains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The question being asked today by market participants no longer concerns a particular country or sector: it is whether the political commitment exists to support the euro as a project and to improve this project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The answer to this question should be clear: the euro has brought immense economic benefits to its member countries, both in northern and southern Europe, and to non-participating countries such as the UK.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">We must unite to support the euro as a project and to decisively improve it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">What does it take to restore confidence?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">First, governments should pursue their efforts to bring down public debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.67,0)">They have exhausted their fiscal room for manoeuvre and must rebuild it so as to be resistant to future shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Fiscal consolidation weighs down on short-term economic activity, but it is a precondition to crowd in private investment and restore long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.42,0)">Second, we must put a halt to financial market fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.87,0)">The disintegration of euro area capital markets has reached a point where it puts at risk the whole European project, including the single market for goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.47,0)">European firms can no longer finance their investments from a single pool of savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.06,0)">This hampers the possibility of a sustained and high level of growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">By extending ample amounts of liquidity to euro area banks, the ECB has mitigated the retreat of private cross-border capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is not its role however to allocate financial resources across the region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Resource allocation should be performed through market mechanisms, with appropriate price signals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Bringing euro area capital markets together will require more than technical adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">There can indeed be technical considerations, such as the impact of the forthcoming liquidity regulation under the Basel III agreement, which should be calibrated in such a way that it does not impede the functioning of the interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">But it’s trust that is the essence of the lending relationship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Restoring trust in banks and disentangling the fate of banks from that of governments are absolute prerequisites.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The ECB’s two longer- term refinancing operations, or LTROs, have been powerful enough to ensure continued excess liquidity and to ease most of the tensions in funding markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But there is nothing that the ECB can do when it comes to banks’ solvency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Euro area banks should strengthen their capital and do it in a way that makes them less dependent on their governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">To this end, the euro area needs a single resolution mechanism and resolution fund, and a unified mechanism of deposit insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Banks that need recapitalisation must also be allowed to directly access the European Financial Stability Facility   and, when it is in place, the European Stability Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me add a warning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.62,0)">Letting euro area banks access the EFSF/ESM should not be a way for governments to escape their responsibilities and to rid themselves of the cost of past errors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">It should be accompanied by strong, centralised supervision of systemically important institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">In a nutshell, the only way out of this crisis is to map out a credible path towards a stronger Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Of course, far-reaching institutional changes can only be based on democratic deliberation, especially as some of those changes would entail an additional transfer of responsibilities to a supranational level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Any such mechanism should have strong democratic foundations and be subject to appropriate accountability, in particular to the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">How then can growth be achieved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Price stability and financial stability are essential preconditions for growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">What can then be done to improve the long-term rate of growth of the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Many good ideas have been floated here and I will not repeat them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">A lot can be achieved in my view by strengthening the single market for goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.71,0)">So far, the single market has not suffered from the ongoing crisis, but we all know that it has not been completed, especially in services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Mario Monti made some proposals in this respect in 2010, as did Michel Barnier more recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Competition is of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In many sectors, rents are appropriated by special interest groups and should be returned to the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Finally, investment in research, human capital and infrastructure is key to ensuring that the negative impact of austerity remains limited in time and does not weigh down on the long-term growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">New ways of pooling resources and financing the common provision of public goods should be found.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">I conclude on a positive note.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Overall, the euro area has a high private saving rate and sound fiscal fundamentals, with deficit and debt ratios that are much lower than in the US, the UK or Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Its workforce is industrious and highly skilled; its firms are innovative and do not fear global competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">If the euro area unites and overcomes the present crisis of confidence, it will emerge as a strong economy for the rest of the 21st century.</span>
