    <h1> The external and internal dimensions of  Europe's competitiveness </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB at the Institute of International and European Affairs Dublin, 26 February 2009 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.67,0)"> The external and internal dimensions of Europe’s competitiveness Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat the Institute of International and European AffairsDublin, 26 February 2009 Ladies and gentlemen, These are very challenging times – for Ireland, for Europe and for the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">I am very pleased to be here in Dublin today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">When, last year, the Institute of International and European Affairs kindly invited me to give a lecture on Europe’s competitiveness, I was delighted to accept the opportunity to look at Europe’s economy from a broad perspective and to focus particularly on the growing challenge of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">As the title for my address today I have chosen “The external and internal dimensions of Europe’s competitiveness”, because it is my deep conviction that these two dimensions are closely related.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.35,0)">And they are also related to the current situation, as we shall see.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I will therefore also take the opportunity to talk about the economic crisis, its impact on Europe as a whole and on the Irish economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Developments in the international economy were always likely to have a particular impact on this country, reflecting its very open nature and its strong dependence on international trade and financial flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.75,0)">But it is important that we recognise the global nature of this crisis, in which public authorities everywhere are confronted by the adverse effects of the market turbulence on their own economies and financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">And it is important to recognise that despite these difficulties, we have not lost the things that have made our real economies so successful in recent years, notably our talented workforces, our dynamic businesses and our openness to trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me start by focusing on the topic suggested to me by the hosts of today’s event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I would like to address some specific aspects of the external performance of the euro area and the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">And I would like to discuss how they relate to key internal dimensions including integration, flexibility and competition, drawing your attention to policy changes that are necessary to maintain and improve Europe’s competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">As I will argue, those reforms will not only help the European economy to succeed in an increasingly globalised world: they are also crucial for getting through the current situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Defining competitiveness So what do we mean by “competitiveness”?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.2,0)">For many people, competitiveness is a disconcerting word, suggestive of pressures to change and constant adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.28,0)">And as we know, these pressures can have personal and social costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">But there are very large benefits – we need to stay competitive for the long-term welfare of the people of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.21,0)">What does the word competitiveness mean to economists?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In a narrow sense, it is often used to refer to international price competitiveness as measured by various indicators of effective exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">At the European Central Bank we analyse developments according to a whole host of such indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This concept of competitiveness is linked to the “external performance” of a country, typically measured in terms of export growth, shares of export markets or current account balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Developments in price competitiveness have always been important drivers of an economy’s ability to compete in international markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">But in recent years, other factors have become increasingly important in the face of the structural changes engendered by globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These relate to export specialisation, which includes the range and the quality of the products a country exports, and the particular markets it exports to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In this regard, it is important that our countries take advantage of their high technological advancement and well-educated labour forces, to produce higher quality and more sophisticated goods and to redirect their exports towards strongly growing markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Looking even more closely into the domestic structure of an economy we come to the notion of productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Productivity and competitiveness are two different concepts, but there are close links between them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">“Competitiveness”, when more broadly defined, includes a notion of relative productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Under this definition, the most competitive economy is the one with the best prospects for “generating” highly productive firms, contributing to longer-term economic growth and, ultimately, to the welfare of its citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Recent advances in trade theory have stressed the connections between the external and internal dimensions of competitiveness, which have become increasingly relevant in a globalising economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Some of the latest economic models of trade   see global competition as a selection mechanism, in which only the most productive firms do business outside their national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.02,0)">Less productive firms, by contrast, which are unable to bear the transport and other costs related to foreign trade, are either forced out of business or remain confined to their domestic market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Countries in which highly productive firms can thrive are therefore also likely to do better in terms of their overall export performance, as this will allow more firms to compete successfully in international markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">In general, these are countries with more intense domestic market competition, better technology and greater openness to foreign competitors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">These new models also stress the importance of countries’ institutional framework which may make market access easier and push domestic firms to innovate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">According to this body of economic knowledge, continuing efforts to promote stronger competition and further market integration within Europe appear to be important tools for supporting and enhancing the global competitiveness of European firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Globalisation and Europe’s external competitiveness Applying these concepts to Europe, how do we assess our external competitiveness; how are European firms performing in globalised markets?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Globalisation has given a boost to world trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Over the past two decades world trade has grown one and a half times faster than world output, and the difference has even considerably higher in recent years as world trade growth accelerated very strongly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Transport costs have dropped dramatically, as have tariffs, and the surge in information and communication technology has facilitated a global exchange of goods and services as well as globalised supply chains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">More and more goods and services have become tradable, and domestic companies have increasingly engaged in international trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The euro area has actively contributed to the rise in international trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Our continent has a long history in trading, but the openness of the euro area has increased that business markedly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the mid-1990s, exports of goods and services from the euro area were equivalent to around 30%   of GDP; now they are equivalent to around 44% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.05,0)">Earlier observers who said that European integration could lead to a closing vis-à-vis the outside world have proved to be utterly wrong: quite the opposite has happened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Of course, Europe’s trade has grown not only because of Asia’s, and particularly China’s emergence as a fully-fledged trading partner, but also by the growing role of the central and eastern European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">But even though we are roughly comparable in size to the United States, the euro area is about ten percentage points more open, and we are much more open than Japan, despite our larger size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This is an indication of why Europe has a key stake in global economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Europe’s openness is also remarkable in international finance: over the past decade, the stock of outward and inward foreign direct investment has virtually doubled as a percentage of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">And even more strikingly, the euro area is more open financially than other advanced countries, like the United States and Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In 2007, international financial assets and liabilities of the euro area, as a percentage of GDP, reached almost 160%, compared with about 135% for the United States and 90% for Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">And this explains why Europe is largely exposed to the current global financial crisis and it underscores to which extent Europe has an important stake in global financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Greater openness in trade and finance has of course created new challenges, which have rarely been as visible as today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">And just as with the global financial crisis, global trade integration calls for constant adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.58,0)">As low-cost competitors have emerged, the euro area – just like other advanced economies – has recorded some losses in world export market shares.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.14,0)">These losses partly reflect the mechanical effect of the increasing shares of the new entrants, but the challenge for advanced economies remains: to adjust their export portfolios according to their technological comparative advantages, towards higher quality products, and towards products that are more skill-intensive and capital-intensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">So what is the comparative advantage of the euro area in the global economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Recent ECB analysis   has looked at so-called Balassa indices of revealed comparative advantage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">According to these indices, a country specialises in a specific product or sector, if the share of that product or sector in the country's exports is higher than the share of that product or sector in world exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">This analysis suggests, somewhat surprisingly, and in contrast to other advanced economies, that the euro area specialisation overall has not changed much over last one and a half decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">There has been neither a decline in the specialisation in labour-intensive products, nor the expected shift towards more research-intensive production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.36,0)">This might reflect structural rigidities that constrain the ability of euro area firms to adjust rapidly, but it could also mean that euro area firms have so far not been under significant pressure to make substantial changes in their specialisation - particularly in medium-high-tech exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But this general picture for the euro area does however not necessarily hold for all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.61,0)">Overall, there have been substantial differences in the export performance across individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.85,0)">And euro area countries have witnessed significant differences in cost competitiveness since the launch of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This explains why the ECB has always said that an appropriate peer surveillance of the evolution of competitiveness indicators, including cost competitiveness and unit labour costs was of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The internal dimension of European competitiveness This brings me naturally to the second part of my talk, the internal dimension of European competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Understanding the causes of growing labour cost differentials or the cumulative increases in labour costs across euro area countries is very important for improving the adjustment process of countries within Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.47,0)">From an economist’s perspective, increases in unit labour costs stem from higher compensation per employee or lower productivity, or a combination of the two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">In the case of the euro area, the main source of difference in recent years has been differences in the growth rates of compensation per employee, rather than differences in productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Let’s look at the reasons behind these differences and the options that countries have to improve their situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Such analysis is particular important at this time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.49,0)">Some countries may not only be affected by the global downturn and the financial crisis; they may also need to adjust in order to undo domestic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I see four main developments which have arisen in the Monetary Union and which help to explain the observed differences in increases in labour costs in a number of euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.76,0)">First, some countries might have entered the euro area at a moment where this overall cost competitiveness was clearly hampered for a number of reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Germany offers a clear example of such an economy due to the strong increases of unit labour costs associated with the reunification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">A lower level of increases in unit labour cost than the average of the euro area was advisable for such economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.98,0)">Second, the opposite case has also been observed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Some countries have entered the euro area in a position of relative ‘over- competitiveness’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The Netherlands for instance had in 1999 a very strong competitive position due to the success of their longstanding previous strategy of competitive disinflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">A higher level of increases of unit labour cost during several years is explainable in such a situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Third, some countries might be or might have been catching up in terms of growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Then they may have experienced relatively strong trend increases in per capita GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">To the extent that these income per capita developments are sustainable, relatively strong wage increases are justifiable by reference to the fundamentals of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">These three first developments are economically justified and need not be a concern to policy makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.37,0)">However, there is a fourth type of developments which poses problems for the economies concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Some euro area countries have witnessed a long period of strong growth in domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.16,0)">These demand pressures were related to expectations of consumers or firms about future income and profit prospects, which, it is now clear, were overly optimistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.92,0)">This situation was often accompanied or intensified by an insufficiently tight fiscal stance, even if headline fiscal numbers   still suggested a healthy fiscal situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.18,0)">Technically speaking, governments and the public have mistakenly taken a cyclical or temporary expansion to be an upward shift in potential output and long-term income growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.56,0)">They thus took insufficient account of the impact of a possible downturn in activity on the public finances and private income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">In simpler terms, this means nothing less than extrapolating the good times almost for ever and accordingly increasing spending and indebtedness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In our economic models, we often speak about “forward-looking agents”, portraying households, firms and governments as making rational economic calculations with a watchful eye on the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.08,0)">But in reality, we have to be aware of too many “forward-spending” agents, private and public alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.43,0)">Such a situation can stoke inflation and bring cumulated losses in competitiveness, lower export performance and a high current account deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.11,0)">Moreover, it has often resulted not only in pressures on the prices of goods and services, but also in asset price inflation, notably in the housing market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.88,0)">In addition, in some cases sizeable wage increases in the public sector during normal or good times may have provided the wrong signals for wage bargaining in other sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.33,0)">The accumulation of relative losses in competitiveness and the build-up of domestic imbalances need, at some point, to be corrected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The correction within a monetary union can and must be achieved through lower unit labour costs increases relative to the average of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">In an environment of flexible wages and prices, this adjustment could proceed smoothly without significant losses in output and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.96,0)">However if the economy concerned suffers from structural rigidities in product and labour markets, a more protracted and more painful adjustment in output and employment will then finally take place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As enhancing flexibility has been a message that the ECB has championed for a long time, let me focus on such rigidities, which unfortunately appear to affect most countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.39,0)">I believe there should be more public awareness that insufficient attention of wage setting to current and expected productivity developments makes any correction to previous losses of competitiveness more painful in terms of output and employment losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.42,0)">Competitiveness, the crisis and the challenges for policy Let me now turn to the current difficulties in the international economy, which are having such a strongly negative impact on the Irish economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">For many years, Ireland has been a great success story: openness to trade and a high degree of flexibility have allowed the country to benefit substantially from globalisation during the last decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">It now has a very high income per capita, and it is characterised by a skilled workforce, a flexible labour market, moderate taxation and a business-friendly regulatory environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.58,0)">None of these advantages have been lost as a result of the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">But crucially for Ireland, this unprecedented international shock has come at the same time as the economy has been undergoing a necessary rebalancing in the composition of its growth, intensifying the challenges it faces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In particular the construction and the banking sectors need to adjust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The Irish government is acting resolutely to address the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">With the public finances, important action is being taken to make immediate savings, and plans are being drawn up for a return to compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">A fiscal policy that convincingly reduces future public deficits is indeed absolutely essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In addition, measures have been taken or are under way to recover lost competitiveness and to exploit the country’s comparative advantages in its high-tech, high-skills industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">What is crucial at this moment for all economic policy actors, is to take measures that are both supportive in the current environment and in the longer-term interests of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.69,0)">Many euro area countries, despite some progress, still exhibit structural impediments triggered by a rigid legal and regulatory environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.24,0)">Unemployment is a clear concern right now in many parts of the euro area, and we surely do not want to lose human capital or scar a large proportion of the people of working age.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">As I mentioned before wage restraint would help a lot in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">More generally, in order to minimise job and output losses related to the current downturn, it is vital that euro area governments and social partners pursue four objectives: First, wage setting needs to take account of the competitiveness and labour market conditions in a responsible and timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Second, national authorities should pursue courageous policies of spending restraint especially in the case of public wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">A prudent fiscal stance should be always in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Third, the completion of the Single Market, particularly in services and network industries, should be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">A deeper integration of markets is crucial to foster competition and open product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.51,0)">Measures that hinder free competition and cross-border trade must be avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In this context, it is of the utmost importance to resist protectionist measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Fourth, in the context of the Lisbon agenda, the necessary reforms that enhance competition and improve long-term growth prospects in the euro area must be implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Especially in these difficult times such reforms are very important in all euro area countries to counteract the economic downturn and limit its negative impact on employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.63,0)">The price of delaying reforms is particularly high at the current stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">For many years, we have been saying that we need structural reforms – more openness, more competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The crisis offers us the opportunity and the obligation to seize the moment and implement the right reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">These would help the economy overcome the crisis and be stronger afterwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I also want to call on European policy makers as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">As a lesson from the current crisis, we should consider ways how to strengthen our surveillance of competitiveness within the European Union, and in particular the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This should help countries to build stronger buffers in good times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">And it should also help to avoid excessive increases in unit labour costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.99,0)">In other words, this would prevent us from again extending public and private spending beyond sustainable levels and experiencing difficulties similar to the current ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Conclusion Let me draw to a close.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.71,0)">As you know, the great Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw was not at all impressed by the economics profession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.34,0)">His was the famous disparaging remark that 'if all economists were laid end to end, they would not reach a conclusion'.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Certainly in these very challenging times, it is not easy for all economic policy-makers to reach agreement on the way forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">But let me offer some conclusions on which I hope we can all agree.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The euro area is resolutely addressing the challenges of the global financial turbulence, the global imbalances and the resulting global slowdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Looking forward, we need to continue with our efforts to make the euro area stronger, more flexible, more resilient and more prosperous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The ECB’s Governing Council, of which Governor Hurley has been a member for many years, is tirelessly working to make the euro area better off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">I am also optimistic about the prospects for this country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.8,0)">The Irish economy clearly faces severe challenges over the next few years – and hard decisions will have to be taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">But in many ways, the Irish economy is an excellent example of some of the characteristics that foster global competitiveness – in its openness, its flexibility and its high levels of education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">And this has paid off in significant increases in income per capita.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.21,0)">Some things will of course have to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.38,0)">But none of the positive characteristics are lost nor should they be lost in the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In my view, the open nature of this economy with its associated flexibility and adaptability means that Ireland will be well placed to benefit greatly from the eventual recovery and to compete effectively in the global economy in the future.</span>
