    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> The changing world of global governance Keynote by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB at the Institute of International Finance, Spring Membership MeetingVienna, 10 June 2010 Ladies and Gentlemen, I remember vividly when the Institute of International Finance   was founded back in 1983 at the time of the international debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">One of its key early tasks was to inform members about fundamentals and policies in borrowing countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Since then, the range of the Institute’s activities has broadened a great deal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I have continuously interacted with the IIF since its beginning; in the 1980s as chairman of the Paris Club, later as Governor of the Banque de France and over the last years as President of the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">And as Co-Chairman of the Group of Trustees of the “Principles”, I enjoy the regular events together with distinguished colleagues from the public and private sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">I want to thank Charles Dallara, in particular, for his dynamism and constant efforts in fostering dialogue between the private sector and the official sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">The IIF gatherings always provide a fantastic opportunity for stimulating exchanges of views on the international financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">When preparing my remarks for tonight, I looked at my text from the 25th Anniversary IIF Membership Meeting in October 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">At the time, I concluded that “it is the task of all the stakeholders of the global financial system   to live up to their respective responsibilities and contribute appropriately to the stability of this system.” I trust that all will agree that this statement remains valid today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.35,0)">* * * In recent weeks, we have had difficult news not only on the financial system but also the ecosystem – the news that the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico is spreading ever wider – from the riggers who lost their lives in the explosion to their employers, local communities, environmental agencies and public policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Similarly, the financial events of the last three years, which began in a seemingly small part of the US housing market, have touched all of our lives and come to test the resilience of our whole system of global economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.22,0)">The financial crisis has tested the business models and risk management systems of market participants, and the rules and structures of the markets in which they operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">It has tested the preparedness of central banks and governments to take unprecedented support measures to preserve confidence in markets and the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">And it has tested the ability of the institutions of global governance to restore financial and economic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Just as the Deepwater Horizon oil spill is doing for environmental protection and natural resource management, the financial crisis offers many lessons for management of the global economy – lessons about private sector incentives, lessons about regulation and lessons about global interdependencies and the ever-growing need for effective policy coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.23,0)">Tonight, I would like to share with you a few thoughts on the strengths and weaknesses of our system of global governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">* * * But before doing so, let me say a few words on the current situation in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In recent weeks, the euro area governments and the ECB were once again called upon to demonstrate their ability to take swift and essential action to face up with exceptional circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In 2008, the ECB decided on unprecedented measures when private financial intermediation was first impaired and then on the verge of collapse, and we restored it to its prime function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">On both sides of the Atlantic, we had to cope with impaired money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We set the conditions for banks to resume lending to each other and to their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">We helped reconstruct the market when it had disappeared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">And we laid the foundations for the nascent recovery to start and consolidate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Throughout these actions, the ECB has maintained price stability and the stability of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">A month ago, we sprung into action for a second time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.66,0)">It was for the same reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.66,0)">Once more, private financial intermediation – often secured by government paper – was threatened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.95,0)">The market for government paper – the basis for the pricing of many financial assets, from fixed-income instruments to equity – was seriously impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">We judged – and we continue to judge – that our monetary policy stance was appropriately tuned to the conditions and the prospects of the broader economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.55,0)">But once more – as in the autumn of 2008 – we could see that the transmission mechanism was not functioning sufficiently well to channel our policy intentions to the broader economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Therefore, we intervened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Our Securities Markets Programme is targeted to those segments of the euro area government debt markets that are most dysfunctional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The aim is to restore a precondition to our primary function of accomplishing price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">At the same time, we have taken note of the commitment of the euro area governments to take all measures needed to meet fiscal targets this year and the years ahead, and that each one of them is ready to take the necessary measures to accelerate fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">And we are in close contact with the Commission and authorities to verify that further convincing and concrete consolidation and reform strategies are prepared and implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The Greek authorities have started to implement the ambitious economic and financial programme that was agreed with International Monetary Fund and the European Commission, in liaison with the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This programme itself is an important achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It is based on prudent macroeconomic assumptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is frontloaded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It has the potential to correct long-standing flaws, because it entails a very comprehensive structural reform package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.72,0)">This structural reform package to my surprise seems still largely unknown to many.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">The three institutions will regularly come to Athens to monitor the programme and support the government in its efforts to implement the measures, so as to secure a better future for the Greek people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">We consider that the Greek programme has the appropriate features to succeed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.77,0)">Many policy adjustments that seemed Herculean at the start have succeeded in history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">And we have indications that the budget execution in Greece in the first five months of 2010 – despite a painful recession – is on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.26,0)">The central government cash deficit is more than 40% below the level over the same period last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">We see encouraging signs in other countries too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Measures are being prepared to credibly advance fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Those measures are particularly helpful if they focus strongly on the expenditure side, because such measures have in the past proven more effective, and if they address one prime cause of a loss of competitiveness in recent years: the rise of public salaries relative to the rest of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.84,0)">The view that fiscal consolidation is generally negative for growth is too narrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.52,0)">Demand-side economics has in the past underestimated the risks of excessive spending, and is now overestimating the risks of consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">We have to take into account that today’s adjustments are being made in strict association with structural reforms and they enhance confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Both elements will increase supply and, along with supply potential, prospective incomes and thus demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">These adjustments are therefore ultimately growth-friendly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">There are very important decisions under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.03,0)">It is true that Europe’s decision-making process is complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is because it involves both national and supranational actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.24,0)">But complexity does not mean ineffectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Europe has been remarkably effective during the 2007/2008 financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.72,0)">Not a single systemically important institution has failed, not a single recovery programme has been refused by any parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">What markets often underestimate is Europe’s complete dedication to the degree of integration achieved so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Decisions were taken recently, which were difficult to foresee by observers and markets only a few months or weeks ago: a negotiated fully-fledged adjustment programme for a member state, a €80 billion support loan by member states for that programme, and a €440 billion financial stability facility, on top of a €60 billion existing facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This provides Europe with a highly significant endowment of a total of €580 billion  , without even counting the possible additional IMF co-financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me now turn to the main topic of my remarks: global governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Global governance and the crisis Global economic governance embraces supranational institutions – such as the IMF – as well as informal groupings – such as the G7 and the G20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Both are necessary, and both are complementary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Supranational institutions offer a framework for dialogue and formal agreement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Informal fora are invaluable for “softening the ground” in areas where decision-making processes remain largely national – whether in forging a consensus on prudential standards and codes, or facilitating the coordination of economic policies when appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.84,0)">How did this system of formal and informal elements fare during the crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Let me highlight one strength and two areas that are still in need of strengthening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">To my mind, particular resilience was shown by the central banking community – both bilaterally and channelled through the various Basel-based committees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">This institutionalised cooperation ensured an unprecedented degree of collaboration in, for instance, the provision of cross-border liquidity – the network of temporary currency swaps or repos set up bilaterally by central banks such as the Fed and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This cooperation has been reaffirmed and further activated in recent weeks as market conditions have deteriorated, underlining the strong commitment of the central banking community to addressing the global crisis in a co-ordinated way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.42,0)">Of the areas still in need of strengthening, the first relates to macroeconomic policies that were clearly insufficiently oriented towards medium-term sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.7,0)">This led to the build-up of unsustainable external imbalances between deficit and surplus economies prior to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.19,0)">No effective mechanism existed to influence macroeconomic and structural policies in key countries where those policies appeared unsustainable from the standpoint of global economic and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This must change – and it requires both improvements in the efficiency and legitimacy of international institutions and a broader awareness by national authorities of their global responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The G20 Mutual Assessment Framework is promising in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Just this last weekend, G20 Ministers and Governors in Korea reviewed this process, which will now be examined by Heads of State in Toronto in early July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The momentum is here, and we fully support this overall process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.24,0)">The second shortcoming was the insufficient coordination in financial regulation before the crisis, which encouraged regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.25,0)">This was the unavoidable result of the disparity between the increasingly global financial players, and the largely national approach to financial regulation, with only relatively weak coordination at the international level, despite the remarkable efforts of the Basel Committee in respect of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The crisis demonstrated quite clearly that proceeding too far down the road of deregulation is not always conducive to better functioning markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Rather, markets require an effective regulatory and supervisory infrastructure to function properly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Of course, setting common rules in complex and innovative fields such as finance requires finding the balance between allowing financial innovation and growth, and preserving stability for the good of the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But it should remain foremost in all our minds that the prime purpose of the financial sector is to serve the real economy, not the other way around.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Changes to the regulatory environment should reflect that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Given the current downturn and the volatility of financial markets, it is imperative that the timelines for regulatory reform agreed by the G20 in the autumn of 2008 are met.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Policy-makers should remain committed to setting rigorous standards and designing appropriate transition periods that will allow countries and financial institutions to implement the agreed regulatory standards consistently and fully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In this context, the Basel Committee’s reform package, released last December for consultation, forms one of the cornerstones of the financial regulatory reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It is important, however, that the cumulative impact of the reform package on financial institutions and the real economy is thoroughly assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We will carefully consider the impact analysis presented by the IIF in the process of evaluating the multifaceted impact mechanisms of regulatory changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.94,0)">There may well be differences in views on the most appropriate way of computation as well as on underlying assumptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">We have to deliver a much safer and much more resilient financial system that it to the benefit of the sustainable development of the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The evolution of global governance Let me now turn to how the system of global governance is evolving in response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">I see three major trends: First, the scope of international cooperation is broadening significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Second, the efficiency and legitimacy of global governance is being addressed: the mandates and governance structures of existing international institutions are being strengthened, existing informal fora adjusted and new fora developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Third, the system is moving decisively towards a much more inclusive system of global governance, encompassing key emerging economies as well as the industrialised countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The acknowledgment of the increasing role of emerging economies is a trend that predates the recent crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.45,0)">But the crisis has made it even more pressing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Although emerging countries have also been immediately affected, they have rapidly become a source of strength for the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In 2009, the contribution of emerging countries to global growth was 57%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the same year, they represented roughly one third of world GDP at market exchange rates  , and close to a half using PPP rates  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">There are several examples where these three trends become apparent: The emergence of the G20 as the prime group for global economic governance is probably the most prominent example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">It provided policy impulse and took decisive actions during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It is now making the transition from crisis resolution to crisis prevention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">This is the purpose of its framework for strong, sustainable and balanced growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Its primary goal is collectively to implement coherent and medium-term policies to attain a mutually beneficial growth path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Since this process is fully owned by the G20 members, and involves Heads of State and Government, it also confirms the strong commitment at the global level to more multilateralism in economic decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A second example is the designation of the Global Economy Meeting   as the prime group for the governance of central bank cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This forum includes central bank governors from all systemic emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">I currently have the privilege of chairing the GEM, and find the candid exchange of views at our bi-monthly meetings of enormous value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">And a third example is the reform and the expansion of the Financial Stability Board  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It now includes all the systemic emerging market economies, largely overlapping with the G20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Its mandate has been enhanced to strengthen the international financial architecture and global financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.05,0)">The FSB assesses vulnerabilities affecting the global financial system and reviews the regulatory, supervisory and related actions needed to address them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Insights from the crisis Let me draw to a close.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Looking ahead, and distilling insights from the financial and economic turbulence of recent years, I would like to stress three points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.58,0)">First, the crisis has shattered previously held convictions that ‘keeping one’s house in order’ and self-regulation are sufficient to ensure global welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">We have seen that improvements are needed to preserve the safety of the global economic and financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">These improvements concern rules of the game and procedures, but they also concern attitudes and underlying values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Countries have to recognise the global impact of their policies and financial market players have to accept that the prime purpose of the financial sector is to serve the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Second, more than in the past, global governance must demonstrate a capacity to coordinate and decide extremely swiftly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.78,0)">A characteristic of the turbulences that intensified in September 2008 was the extreme rapidity in the succession of events as the crisis unfolded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The very high degree of interdependency between all economies calls for a much higher level of cooperation than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Third, the crisis has rightly accelerated the inclusion of emerging markets into the framework of global governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But there are two reasons for this change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">One is positive: the emerging economies are now economically and financially so important, and systemically so influential, that they must be fully involved in global governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.89,0)">I hesitate to unveil the other reason that is not flattering for industrialised countries: they did not live up to their responsibilities prior to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Now, the industrialised countries are called on to contribute to the stability and prosperity of the global economy within the new, more inclusive framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Looking ahead, we see that the global recovery has started to proceed at different speeds across regions, with a relatively modest recovery in advanced countries like the United States, Japan and the euro area and a stronger expansion in the emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">And yet, there is no time for complacency as recent tensions in financial markets have amply demonstrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Let me stress that it is important that the recovery should be measured in broader terms than the simple resumption of GDP growth and a return to sustainable fiscal positions: it means a full restoration of trust in our financial institutions; it requires the healing of wounds inflicted by the irresponsible behaviour of some financial players on our societies and on the real economy; and it requires renewed confidence that global governance is strong, broad and flexible enough to ensure global economic and financial stability and resilience in the future.</span>
