    <span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)"> Introductory statement before the Plenary of the European Parliament Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB,Brussels, 25 March 2010 Introduction Sehr geehrter Herr Präsident, sehr geehrte Damen und Herren Abgeordnete, ich freue mich, anlässlich der Debatte zur Entschließung über den Jahresbericht 2008 der Europäischen Zentralbank heute bei Ihnen zu sein.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Aufgrund der Parlamentswahlen im vergangen Jahr hat sich die diesjährige Debatte deutlich verschoben.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Aber dies eröffnet mir die Möglichkeit, die wesentlichen Entwicklungen im letzten Jahr vor der neu gewählten Plenarversammlung zu erörtern, und am Ende auch auf die aktuelle Lage einzugehen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Comme vous le savez, la BCE se félicite des relations très étroites avec le Parlement, qui vont bien au-delà des obligations prévues par le Traité.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Nous avons établi, au fil des années, un dialogue très fructueux.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Aujourd’hui, dans mon exposé, je passerai brièvement en revue les évolutions économiques observées en 2009 et les mesures de politique monétaire prises par la BCE.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Ensuite, j’aborderai quelques points soulevés dans votre proposition de résolution et je terminerai par quelques remarques sur la situation actuelle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.2,0)">Economic developments and monetary policy over the past year So what have been the key developments in the economy and in monetary policy over the past year?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.53,0)">In 2009, the European Central Bank was operating in an environment that future economic historians are likely to describe as the most difficult one for advanced economies since the Second World War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.46,0)">Following the profound intensification of the financial crisis in the autumn of 2008, the year 2009 started with a continued synchronised fall in economic activity worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.08,0)">Until around April last year, economic activity was declining, month after month, faster than any model had predicted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.66,0)">That is why we have often characterised what we were experiencing as a “free fall” in economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The immediate policy action taken by central banks, governments and Parliaments across the world stopped this “free fall” and laid the foundations for a gradual recovery in Europe and elsewhere over the course of 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.52,0)">I would venture to say that if central banks, governments and Parliaments around the world had not acted as resolutely as they did, it could have become the most difficult episode for advanced economies since the First World War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The ECB was in the vanguard of the world’s central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">We have confirmed our capability to take bold and timely action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Our “trademark”, which was vital for maintaining confidence, has been the ability to take the necessary immediate and exceptional decisions whilst, at the same time, remaining inflexibly attached to our primary objective of maintaining price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The ECB’s medium-term orientation in its interest rate policy and in the design of non-standard measures has helped to contain the emergence of both deflationary and inflationary risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Inflation expectations remained well anchored throughout the crisis, while we provided essential support to the real economy through the banking system and the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Some of the most important non-standard measures that we used were an unlimited provision of liquidity to banks, an extension of operations for periods of up to one year and a moderate, yet highly effective purchase programme for covered bank bonds, which reactivated this segment of the bank funding market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Overall, our non-standard monetary policy measures – which are known collectively as “enhanced credit support” – have served the euro area economy well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">They have supported the functioning of the money market, contributed to improving financing conditions and allowed for a better flow of credit to the real economy than could have been achieved through interest rate reductions alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.98,0)">By and large, banks have been passing on the sharply lower key ECB interest rates to households and businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Designing a timely exit strategy from our non-standard measures was a central part of the ECB’s response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In September last year, we set out our overall strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In December, we decided on its implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.59,0)">The guiding principle is that to the extent that the situation returns to normal, keeping such measures in place for longer than required risks changing the behaviour of financial market participants in an undesirable manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.28,0)">We do not wish to breed dependency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Thus, in December 2009, we began to gradually phase out some of our extraordinary liquidity measures, taking account of improvements in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.97,0)">In particular, we scaled back the number, frequency and maturity of longer-term refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">But we have committed to maintaining fully accommodating liquidity support to the euro area banking system until at least October this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The Governing Council is of the opinion that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate, and that the continued firm anchoring of inflation expectations bodes well for price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Specific issues raised in the European Parliament’s draft resolution Let me now turn to some of the issues you raise in your draft resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">On the issues of accountability and transparency, we very much appreciate the regular dialogue with the European Parliament and the constructive spirit with which this exchange is conducted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">I therefore welcome the ECON Committee’s repeated support for our quarterly monetary dialogue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">An independent institution like the ECB, which is accountable to the European people, has to be in close contact with their elected representatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">We consider the ECB to be one of the world’s most transparent central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Our practice of holding a press conference immediately after the Governing Council meeting on monetary policy each month remains a pioneering initiative that has not yet been replicated by our major sister institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">With the publication of our comprehensive Introductory Statement in real-time, we explain policy decisions and their underlying rationale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">During the crisis, we have further intensified our communication efforts and thereby helped to smooth financial market reactions, to build confidence and to lay the foundations for recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">You also requested the views of the ECB on the establishment of a clearing house for instruments such as credit default swaps   within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">I would like to say that the robustness of euro-denominated CDS markets is of direct relevance for the Eurosystem as regards control over its currency and financial stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Central counterparty clearing is very important not only for delivering transparency, but also for diversifying and sharing risk exposures and reducing the incentives to take excessive risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.16,0)">Certain financial instruments, which were introduced for hedging, should not be misused for speculation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Regulators should be able to undertake effective investigations into possible improper conduct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The outlook for EMU during challenging times Mr President, honourable members of the European Parliament, An economic recovery is in progress, but this does not mean that the crisis is over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">For one thing, we know that the pace of recovery will be uneven and we cannot rule out setbacks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.91,0)">For another, we are still facing numerous challenges regarding the reform of our financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Finance must play a constructive role, and not a destructive one, in our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The litmus test for a constructive role is that finance serves the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">To ensure such a role, we still need to improve the functioning of financial systems considerably further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Thus far, a great deal of attention has been focused on the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But effective reforms also have to look very closely at non-bank financial institutions and at the set-up and functioning of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.59,0)">Financial markets are not always efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.85,0)">They are not always deep and liquid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.79,0)">Nor do they always represent a fair competition of views and positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.38,0)">Often, specific market segments can be oligopolistic, dominated by a few large players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.96,0)">In such markets, the views of powerful players can trigger trends that move valuations way out of line with fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We have to devise mechanisms and incentives to ensure that finance does not spiral out of control in the destructive way that it did just prior to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.42,0)">We have to contain systemic disruptions that lead to economic hardship for the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Setting up the European Systemic Risk Board, legislation for which is currently being considered by the Parliament, is part of the correct response to this challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.86,0)">There are other challenges facing the European economy, and these are associated with public finances and sovereign financial health.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Within Europe’s economic and monetary union, there is a clear allocation of responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">With respect to that allocation of responsibilities, everyone can count on the commitment of the ECB to maintain price stability in the euro area as a whole over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Meanwhile, we have not only this commitment, but we also have a track record of nearly a dozen years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Based on our latest staff macroeconomic projections for this year, the average annual inflation rate in the first 12 years of the euro is likely to stand at around 1.95%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">That is in line with our definition of price stability: “below 2%, but close to 2%”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">The ECB’s commitment, strategy and track record are consistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But the smooth functioning of Europe’s economic and monetary union cannot rest on a single pillar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">EMU rests on two pillars, the monetary and the economic one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Policy-makers at the national level must likewise contribute to the success and stability of EMU and they need to deliver policies that are in line with its principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">In particular, they must keep public finances sound and their economies competitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">In the current circumstances, where Europe faces further pivotal decisions, it is more important than ever to recognise that a prosperous union requires determined action by all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Whatever direction the upcoming decisions regarding the current situation may take, the most important issue is that Europe’s policy-makers live up to their responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Monetary Union in Europe is far more than a monetary arrangement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is a union of shared destiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Wir teilen ein gemeinsames Schicksal Nous partageons un destin commun Condividiamo un destino commune Compartimos un destino común This destiny is for our common good, and it is the vision of our founding fathers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.57,0)">Monetary Union is not a matter of convenience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It is part of an overarching process of advancing the integration of the people in Europe that began after the Second World War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">It received a new impetus with the fall of the iron curtain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Europe has seized the opportunity to unite people of sovereign nations in a union of prosperity, stability and values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">I am, of course, aware of the great breadth of discussions about underlying decisions and actions – both within Europe and outside Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.49,0)">Many people are questioning the direction in which we as European citizens, European nations and European policy-makers are going.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In my view, this discussion is under way not because we have failed – it is because we have been successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Europe has succeeded in virtually everything it had wanted to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Uniting a continent in which many capital cities have, at diverse points in history, been capitals of the world is an achievement that is often overlooked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.82,0)">I believe we often play this achievement down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.85,0)">And we are often too quick to criticise our institutions and processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">But they have generally worked well, even in the most difficult times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">During the financial crisis, for example, European institutions and processes have remained effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.05,0)">We have avoided on this side of the Atlantic dramatic events that could have triggered a new intensification of the crisis, which started in the U.S. in September 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.17,0)">And we have not had any mishap with the passing in any of our numerous Parliaments of a financial support package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Europe is functioning and it is delivering what its citizens need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Through our Economic and Monetary Union, we have achieved a considerable degree of cohesion and stability – and we must protect that achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">It is within this context that I appreciate the commitment of euro area Member States, made on the occasion of the last European Council meeting, to take determined and coordinated action, if needed, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me also take advantage of my presence in front of the European Parliament to lay out what I already mentioned in the hearing before the Economic and Monetary Committee on Monday.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is the intention of the ECB’s Governing Council to keep the minimum credit threshold in the collateral framework at investment grade level   beyond the end of 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">In parallel, we would introduce, as of January 2011, a graded haircut schedule, which will continue to adequately protect the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I will provide the technical details when reporting on the Governing Council decisions of our next meeting on 8 April.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Conclusion The introduction of the single currency just over a decade ago represents the greatest achievement in the history of European integration to date – a process that has ensured six decades of peace and prosperity in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The global financial crisis has brought fresh challenges to which we in Europe have all risen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Our Monetary Union and our very close ties, inside the single market, with all EU Member States’ economies have prevented the crisis from being compounded by currency crises, as in the traumatic experiences of the early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Today, Europe faces further pivotal decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Our common task is to ensure continued peace and prosperity, to make our union an even more attractive place to live and work in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">For this purpose, we need strengthened surveillance and strengthened cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">We also need to revive the sense of common purpose, the shared ideals that motivated our founding fathers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Their endeavour was visionary and all what we see in today’s world confirms their lucidity.</span>
