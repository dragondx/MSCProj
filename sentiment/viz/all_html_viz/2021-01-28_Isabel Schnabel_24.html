    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.54,0)"> The sovereign-bank-corporate nexus – virtuous or vicious?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.79,0)">Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the LSE conference on “Financial Cycles, Risk, Macroeconomic Causes and Consequences” Frankfurt am Main, 28 January 2021 One year after the first cases were reported in Europe, the coronavirus   pandemic continues to take a tragic human toll and to pose enormous challenges to workers, firms, the financial system and policymakers in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.22,0)">Without the forceful responses of fiscal, monetary and prudential authorities the economic and social costs of this crisis would have been significantly higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Governments, in particular, have stabilised aggregate demand and incomes by absorbing economic and financial risks of the private sector as the crisis unfolded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Through the generous issuance of guarantee schemes, governments secured a continuous flow of credit to firms, which supported economic growth and protected financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Monetary policy has complemented these efforts by providing ample liquidity and restoring favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.52,0)">As a consequence, the policy response to the pandemic has visibly intensified the interdependencies between sovereigns, banks and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">It has created a “sovereign-bank-corporate” nexus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.42,0)">In my remarks today, I will argue that the extent to which such interdependencies may create challenges in the future depends, to a large extent, on the types of feedback loops they create.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Broad fiscal and monetary policy support today minimise the realisation of contingent liabilities in the future, and thus limit the scarring effects of the pandemic on the economy, creating a virtuous circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">So, contrary to the vicious “sovereign-bank” nexus  that plagued the euro area throughout most of the last decade, the current nexus, if managed properly, can be an engine for a faster recovery, which also supports the ECB’s price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.94,0)">A virtuous circle between sovereigns, banks and corporates At the onset of the pandemic, the strict lockdown measures hit large parts of the corporate sector hard, raising its vulnerability to levels last seen during the global financial crisis  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.71,0)">Many firms saw their revenues collapse and were facing acute liquidity shortages that threatened to turn into solvency problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.71,0)">The overall cost of debt financing indicator is calculated as a weighted average of the costs of bank borrowing and market-based debt, based on their respective amounts outstanding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">In response to these developments, governments swiftly launched broad-based measures to support households and firms, including job retention schemes, direct transfers, tax cuts and deferrals, as well as loan guarantees  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">At the same time, the ECB supported bank lending to firms by providing ample liquidity at favourable conditions, while prudential authorities took comprehensive supervisory relief measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">The decisive policy response allowed firms to draw down their credit lines in order to finance their working capital, leading to an unprecedented increase in bank lending in the spring of 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Together, these measures helped prevent an abrupt contraction of credit to firms and a wave of corporate defaults, and protected banks’ profitability and balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Thereby, they created a virtuous circle between sovereigns, banks and corporates  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The wide-ranging policy support protected employment and stabilised aggregate demand, thereby substantially reducing the depth of the recession and the risk of scarring effects in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.56,0)">Consolidated non-financial corporate debt figures also include cross-border inter-company loans, which tend to account for a significant part of debt in countries where a large number of foreign entities, often multinational groups, are located  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The red vertical line represents the threshold of 60% of GDP for sovereign debt as defined in the excessive deficit procedure under the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In addition to rising debt levels, the interlinkages between sovereigns, banks and firms resulting from the broad-based fiscal support have grown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">On the one hand, the sensitivity of public finances to future corporate and financial sector developments has increased, beyond the traditional impact of automatic stabilisers during a recession, such as lower tax revenues and higher social security expenses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.93,0)">On the other hand, banks and corporates have become more dependent on government support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.39,0)">Only recently, possibly in view of the potential phasing out of fiscal support measures, changes in banks’ risk perceptions have resulted in tighter credit standards for firms, according to our latest Bank Lending Survey  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Most notably, this time, the crisis did not originate in the financial sector, as in the global financial crisis , but in the real economy, and public support was granted to firms, not banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Moreover, the pandemic has not raised concerns of moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">While the global financial crisis resulted in the mutualisation of risks that should have been borne by the ultimate risk-takers, government support during the pandemic has protected the economy in the face of an exogenous shock that was not caused by excessive risk-taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">In the pandemic crisis, broad-based fiscal support has been both necessary and proportionate to mitigate the economic and social costs of the containment measures for large parts of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.97,0)">At the same time, with the Banking Union still incomplete, the pandemic has once again exposed old vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">For example, by absorbing some of the newly issued sovereign debt, banks have increased their exposures to the general government in many euro area countries, reinforcing the links between sovereigns and banks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.42,0)">2020, observed; end-2022, potential; percentage of total assets Sources: ECB  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">In fact, bank and sovereign credit ratings remain highly correlated in the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.11,0)">Given that corporate health has become more dependent on the domestic sovereign’s fiscal support, the withdrawal of government support could lead to cliff effects, giving rise to financial instabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.28,0)">It could trigger corporate defaults, a rapid rise in non-performing loans   and tighter financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.47,0)">This, in turn, could cause problems in the banking sector, deepening the recession and further eroding the sovereign’s revenues, while requiring even more guarantees and higher public debt, putting pressure on the sovereign’s credit standing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.94,0)">In other words, the interlinkages between banks, sovereigns and corporates, which were crucial for stabilising the economic and financial situation during the pandemic, could turn into a vicious circle, giving rise to destabilising feedback loops  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First, it depends on the effectiveness of the wide-ranging policy support that is currently in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">An accelerating pace of vaccinations, favourable financing conditions and significant pent-up demand in the form of large savings can prepare the ground for a strong rebound in economic activity in the second half of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This would relieve stretched corporate balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The responsible and timely use of funds provided under the Next Generation EU instrument, in combination with additional national investment efforts, can reinforce the cyclical recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">It can bring the economy back to a higher sustainable growth path by accelerating structural change towards a more digital and less carbon-intensive economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Higher and more sustainable economic growth will be the most important factor in ensuring that reinforced interlinkages will not give rise to vulnerabilities and risks in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Second, the potential materialisation of vulnerabilities will depend on the degree of divergence among euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Despite generally stronger interdependencies, the extent to which these might give rise to challenges in the future differs across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Banks in more highly indebted countries also tend to exhibit higher domestic sovereign exposures and higher corporate NPL ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.35,0)">To a large extent, this reflects unresolved legacy issues with respect to the banking sector and sovereign indebtedness  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The red horizontal and vertical lines indicate sample medians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.12,0)">The asymmetric impact of the pandemic on different industries has exacerbated prevailing vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.29,0)">Countries with high sovereign debt levels are also those that are more dependent on industries hardest hit by the pandemic, such as tourism, resulting in a larger drop in corporate profits  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Less highly indebted  : EE, NL, IE, FI, DE, SI, AT.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">This underlines the importance of support at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The Next Generation EU instrument helps alleviate potential strains on national fiscal space, thereby partly decoupling corporate financing conditions from the fiscal space of their respective sovereigns and directly attenuating the sovereign-bank-corporate nexus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">At the same time, these vulnerabilities are a reminder of the urgent need to make further progress on reforming the euro area’s institutional architecture, in particular by completing the Banking Union, advancing the Capital Markets Union and reviewing the European fiscal framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">These reforms will foster risk sharing, enhance resilience and reduce procyclicality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.25,0)">From the viewpoint of monetary policy, the potential emergence of an adverse macro-financial feedback loop between sovereigns, banks and corporates would matter for at least two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.81,0)">First, it could measurably slow down the return of inflation to our medium-term aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.93,0)">Increasing corporate defaults through a premature withdrawal of fiscal support would deepen the contraction in output and, ultimately, exert additional disinflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.94,0)">Second, there is a risk that the sovereign-bank-corporate nexus could impair the smooth transmission of monetary policy through financial instabilities, a credit crunch and self-fulfilling price spirals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.28,0)">The risk of a premature phasing out of fiscal support is largely outside the ECB’s control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.73,0)">But governments need to be mindful of cliff effects that might set off a vicious circle of corporate defaults, tighter bank lending conditions and growing sovereign vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">We therefore continue to call on governments to extend targeted government support for as long as needed and to use public funds responsibly, with a clear focus on raising productivity and long-term growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">What we can do, however, is preserve favourable financing conditions for as long as necessary to reinforce and amplify the fiscal support and to ensure that private investment is not crowded out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is what the Governing Council reaffirmed at its meeting last week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">On the one hand, this means insulating the bank lending channel from adverse developments, to the extent possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">At our Governing Council meeting in December we therefore decided to further recalibrate our targeted longer-term refinancing operations   by extending the period of more favourable terms by 12 months and by raising the total amount that counterparties are entitled to borrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Preserving favourable financing conditions also means protecting relevant borrowing rates in financial markets from a tightening that would be inconsistent with countering the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We therefore decided to extend and expand our pandemic emergency purchase programme, PEPP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">We will now conduct purchases under the PEPP until at least March 2022 and we will purchase flexibly according to market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This means that if favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions and help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The focus on duration and preservation combines two mutually reinforcing benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.71,0)">First, the longer duration of the PEPP itself has a stabilising impact on financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">It significantly mitigates the risks of a sudden repricing and of self-fulfilling price spirals that threatened to impair the transmission of our policy in March last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Second, this calming effect has the potential to increase the efficiency of our purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">It allows us to calibrate our purchases flexibly according to market conditions, consistent with our commitment to preserve favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">As President Lagarde highlighted last week, this requires the Eurosystem to maintain a strong presence in euro area bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In summary, by focusing on duration and preservation, we are sending a clear signal to markets that the current broad-based policy mix will continue to provide the necessary support to bridge the time until the economy can stand on its own feet once again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The decisive policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic by fiscal, monetary and prudential authorities has successfully prevented a much deeper economic contraction and averted threats to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Government support measures, in combination with the ECB’s ample liquidity provision, have secured bank lending to firms throughout the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.93,0)">Now it must be ensured that the current virtuous sovereign-bank-corporate nexus does not turn into a vicious circle in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.98,0)">This starts with minimising the risks of cliff effects associated with an abrupt and premature withdrawal of public support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">It extends to the swift implementation of the Next Generation EU package and a commitment to use public funds in a way that raises potential growth and nurtures the trust needed to make progress with reforming and completing the euro area’s institutional architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The ECB, for its part, has committed to preserve favourable financing conditions for as long as necessary, reinforcing the fiscal response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The complementarity of fiscal and monetary policy has been instrumental in effectively countering the pandemic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">When the health crisis has been successfully overcome and authorities start to phase out the relief measures, this complementarity should remain an important consideration.</span>
