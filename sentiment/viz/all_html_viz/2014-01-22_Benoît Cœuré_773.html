    <span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)"> The “fourth stage” of EMU: laying the foundations for a sustained recovery Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Interparliamentary Conference on Economic Governance of the European Union,in the context of the European Parliamentary Week,Brussels, 21 January 2014 Mr President  , Mr Meimarakis, Honourable Members, Ladies and Gentlemen, This month, we celebrate the 15th anniversary of the introduction of the euro, marking the start of the third stage of Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.73,0)">We now know that this was not the final stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.09,0)">The crisis and subsequent adjustment have created considerable uncertainty and social hardship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Yet, there are encouraging signs that the situation is changing and that Europe is gradually moving towards recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Fragmentation has significantly receded in euro area financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">What we need now is to create the conditions for a sustained recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And we all have a role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">First, in nurturing a still weak and uneven recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The ECB has a key role to play in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Second, in creating conditions for sustainable long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">And finally, in enhancing democratic accountability and developing a shared vision of the future of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The contribution of monetary policy and banking union Improving the financing of the economy will play a vital part in the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The ECB had an essential key role in this respect throughout the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.76,0)">The ECB was faced with interrelated key challenges, namely deleveraging, fragmentation and a weak economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Like other central banks around the globe, we have taken decisive measures to ensure the proper transmission of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.46,0)">We have reduced the key interest rate to a historic low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.88,0)">We have stated that, in view of the subdued outlook for inflation, we expect interest rates to remain at current or lower levels for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">We are fully committed to maintaining price stability over the medium term, that is, inflation below, but close to, 2%, and we have been absolutely clear that our inflation objective is symmetric: low inflation is as bad as high inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">There are already indications that we are making significant progress in reintegrating financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">It is true that the improvement in financial conditions is not reflected to the same extent in all euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The ECB is committed to fighting financial fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">But there are clear limits to what monetary policy alone can achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">For banks to pass on to their clients the favourable financing conditions, trust needs to be re-established in the European banking sector and its capacity to finance the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Here, the banking union with its first two main pillars, single supervision and resolution, will play a key role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism   is a very big step in the European integration process – probably the biggest since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">At the ECB, we are very conscious of this huge responsibility that we have been asked to shoulder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Intensive preparations are under way in close cooperation with the national supervisors in order to have the SSM fully operational in November 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">As an essential part of that work, we will conduct – together with European Banking Authority – a comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets to create greater transparency in respect of the risks..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">I trust that the conditions set in the comprehensive assessment will be challenging and will contribute to the strong credibility of the exercise..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.91,0)">Yet, integrating supervision is not sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.48,0)">An appropriate resolution framework is essential to deal with banks that are failing or likely to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">The agreement reached by the European Parliament and the Council on the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive   is an important step in this direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">We now need to have an agreement between the Council and the European Parliament on an effective Single Resolution Mechanism   and a Single Resolution Fund  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me first say a few words on the institutional method chosen to set up the SRF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As a Union institution, the ECB supports, as a matter of principle, recourse to the Union method and thus to Union law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The recourse to an intergovernmental agreement should only be seen as a temporary solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">As regards the main features of a functioning SRM, we need lean decision-making, particularly in emergency situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This should allow for taking decisions over a weekend, if needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.59,0)">Robust and common resolution financing arrangements are also required: in this regard, the period of ten years for moving towards a genuinely common SRF is too long and should be shortened, possibly to five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Also, adequate common backstop arrangements need to be established, both for the transition period and the steady state, to guarantee the credibility of the SRF and avoid a persistent or re-emergent sovereign-bank nexus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.63,0)">Finally, the assessment whether a bank is failing or likely to fail should solely be in the hands of the supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The role of national policies and European economic governance Further steps are indeed needed to create a favourable and stable environment for investment and job creation, notably structural reforms to make euro area economies fairer and more competitive, and stabilising public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">These steps have both a national and a European dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">They are of relevance for the Union as whole but particularly pressing for the euro area, where the fates of economies are even more closely interrelated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.63,0)">Each Member State has to act in the knowledge that what happens domestically has direct implications for the rest of the monetary union, while recognising that what happens in the rest of the union will also impact on its own situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This is the only way we can create the basis for shared responsibility and solidarity in EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In spring 2010 the ECB was asked by Member States to join the troika.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The finance ministers of the euro area decided to grant financial assistance to stressed countries, which in return committed to rebalancing their economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The ECB accepted to act in liaison with the Commission and to provide advice and expertise in areas related to our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.55,0)">I am aware that the work of the troika has met with criticism, in particular from the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is fully legitimate to have an open debate on the matter, not least given the huge implications for the everyday lives of citizens in programme countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">It is part of the learning process to assess the European crisis response and to identify what has worked and what could be improved in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">When doing this, one should bear in mind the immensely challenging situation which European institutions and national governments had to cope with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Of course, it is always possible to say that with the benefit of hindsight things could have been done better or differently, and this contributes to the learning process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But advice is provided in a given context, based on given information and under given constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let us also not forget that the adjustment would have had to take place in any case, with or without the troika.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.24,0)">The economic and social costs would have certainly been much higher without the emergency assistance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Finally, let us acknowledge what the EU/IMF programmes have achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The integrity of the euro area has been preserved and financial conditions are improving for programme countries, notably for Ireland, which has safely exited its programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.68,0)">Spain too has exited its banking sector programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Progress on fiscal and external rebalancing and on structural reforms has also been very significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.94,0)">Looking ahead, we need to prevent any return to the complacency of the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">This means that we must make fuller use of the tools at our disposal in the economic governance framework, at the EU and the EMU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The European Parliament and national parliaments have a key role to play in this respect, in the context of the 2014 European Semester.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me reassert here that the Excessive Deficit Procedure   and the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure   are equally important and should be strictly enforced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.41,0)">The lesson of this crisis is that the cost of not intervening where imbalances are identified would be a more brutal adjustment later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The role of parliaments in the “fourth stage” of EMU The crisis revealed that national policies need to be a matter of common concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Therefore, national policies need to be discussed at the European level and the European dimension needs to be brought into national debates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">National parliaments and the European Parliament are the natural fora for such exchanges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">There is clearly a demand for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">The most recent Eurobarometer data   indicates that an overwhelming majority of euro area citizens   support a stronger coordination of economic policies among euro area countries and 63% support the EMU and the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.48,0)">At the same time, two-thirds of Europeans consider that their voice does not count in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">At the ECB, we attach great importance to our accountability, as reflected in our close dialogue with the European Parliament and most recently in the Inter-institutional Agreement with the European Parliament on the accountability of the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">As regards monetary policy, the Governing Council of the ECB is examining how it can enhance the transparency of its decision-making processes by publishing an account of its discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">I am personally convinced that this would help the public understand our decisions better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">At the same time, the European Parliament and national parliaments have a responsibility to engage with the public on the political and economic implications of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Above all, only in a truly European public space can common solutions emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.37,0)">Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">15 years ago the third stage of EMU started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.66,0)">It was believed to be the “final” stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The crisis made clear that we needed to embark on what I would call the “fourth stage” of EMU, as described in particular in the Four Presidents’ report  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.96,0)">In this process we should always ask ourselves: in 15 years from now, what will the people of Europe say when they look back at what we have done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Will they regard it as a decisive moment in paving the way for a stable European economy and sustainable growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">I believe this long-term outlook should be our benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">And in this process, it is clear that further sharing of sovereignty has to go hand in hand with enhanced democratic legitimacy and accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">I trust this year’s European elections will be the occasion for an important debate in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Thank you for your attention  I would like to thank Jean-Francois Jamet and Marion Salines for their contributions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I remain solely responsible for the opinions contained herein.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Towards a Genuine Economic and Monetary Union, report by Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, in close collaboration with José Manuel Barroso,
