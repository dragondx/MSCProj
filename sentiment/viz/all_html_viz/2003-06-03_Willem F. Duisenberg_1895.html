    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> Monetary and fiscal policy in the euro area Introduction by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the International Monetary Conference, Berlin, 3 June 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I would like to begin today by situating my analysis of the current situation in the context of the institutional framework for macroeconomic policies in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the euro area, fiscal policies remain under the exclusive responsibility of national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.35,0)">Contrary to monetary policy, fiscal policies are decentralised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In this set-up, in which there is a multiplicity of actors, certain rules are indispensable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Rules provide a clear allocation of responsibilities and thereby set appropriate incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">If they are abided by, these rules create an efficient co-ordination device for budgetary policies within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In addition, the setting of numerical limits and goals provides clear yardsticks for other policy-makers and the general public to gauge the current and future course of fiscal policies, thus facilitating surveillance and peer pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The Maastricht Treaty states that countries should avoid excessive deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Important reference values for this assessment are a government deficit level of 3% of GDP and a debt-to-GDP ratio of 60%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">In addition, through the Stability and Growth Pact, countries have committed themselves to respect the objective of a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.02,0)">At the current juncture, compliance with the fiscal rules is not satisfactory in several euro area countries, with some of them experiencing or expecting fiscal deficits above the 3%-of-GDP reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.61,0)">These countries now have to pay the price for not having sufficiently consolidated their public finances when economic growth was strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">For these countries, there is a need to abide by the Pact and therefore prevent or correct excessive deficits, so that confidence in the macroeconomic framework of the euro area is boosted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.11,0)">However, some of the euro area countries still facing high, or even excessive, deficits are not sufficiently forcefully implementing the consolidation measures needed to reach sound budgetary positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">At this stage, these countries should focus on the implementation of growth-oriented consolidation policies that strengthen the productive forces of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Such policies would support confidence of economic agents and therefore economic growth also in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.27,0)">By contrast, many other euro area countries have already reached medium-term budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.63,0)">They can let automatic stabilisers operate freely, resulting in the current economic environment in a deterioration of the headline budget balance but not in excessive deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The importance of the functioning of automatic stabilisers in the euro area should not be underestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">In the euro area, the contribution to economic stabilisation made by these stabilisers is generally higher, on average, than in other industrialised countries due to the high sensitivity of revenues and expenditures to economic fluctuations in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.44,0)">However, we have serious doubts about the efficiency of discretionary fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.65,0)">Activist policies may have pro-cyclical effects, given the time-lags involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.69,0)">In addition, they risk undermining the confidence of economic agents in the fiscal framework and in its stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As regards the monetary policy of the ECB, let me start by presenting the principle which forms the foundation of the macroeconomic institutional framework in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">This principle is that of a sound monetary policy aimed at maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The ECB's Governing Council takes its monetary policy decisions within the framework of a well-designed monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Less than one month ago, we confirmed our definition of price stability as a "year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">We also confirmed our medium-term orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">At the same time, we clarified that in the pursuit of price stability we aim to maintain inflation rates below but "close to 2%" over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">This clarification underlines the ECB's general commitment to provide a sufficient safety margin to guard against potential risks of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.41,0)">It also addresses the issue of the possible presence of a measurement bias in the HICP and the implications of inflation differentials within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me turn now to the factors which need to be taken into consideration by monetary policy at the current juncture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.93,0)">The first few months of this year were dominated by the uncertainty related to the escalation of geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.34,0)">This environment, which was also characterised by rising oil prices, was clearly not beneficial for investment and, more generally, economic activity in the euro area and at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.37,0)">As a result, economic growth was relatively weak in early 2003 and expectations for economic growth, at least for this year, have had to be scaled back.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The rapid conclusion of the military activities was accompanied by a normalisation in oil prices and a rebound in stock markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.05,0)">Both developments indicate that market fears of a worst-case scenario of a prolonged phase of acute geopolitical tensions, with negative implications for economic growth, are fading away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.25,0)">Still, the signals coming from economic indicators – mainly the results of surveys on the confidence of consumers and producers – have remained mixed over recent months and have complicated the assessment of the economic situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.83,0)">In this regard, it remains difficult to disentangle factors which may have a transitory effect on economic activity from more entrenched trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.42,0)">Overall, the information that we have gathered so far points to the continuation of weak economic growth throughout the first half of 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">However, we expect some acceleration in economic activity in the second half of this year and thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This outlook seems to be in line with financial market expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me review some of the factors which have shaped this outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, corporate investment continues to be hesitant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.65,0)">This may be related to the process of adjustment of the balance sheets of corporations, following the rapid accumulation of debt until 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.04,0)">The effects of this build-up of debt have been compounded by the significant fall in the value of financial assets from the peak reached in early 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">There is uncertainty over the size of the adjustment still needed in the euro area corporate sector in order to enhance productivity and profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">At the same time, we should not forget that the low level of interest rates that has prevailed for quite a long time in the euro area has helped firms in this adjustment process and should foster a recovery in investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In addition, the financial position of households in the euro area has remained healthy overall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The stability of the saving ratio in the past years indicates that in the euro area as a whole there is no need for significant adjustments which could constrain the recovery in consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The recent fall in oil prices should also support private consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.34,0)">As regards the external balance, given the extent and the length of the period of the appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro, some restraining effects on exports of the euro area will be felt in the period ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">However, we should keep in mind that after the correction which has occurred over the past 12-14 months, the competitive position of euro area producers, measured by indicators of real exchange rates, is now back in line with long-term averages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Furthermore, the effects of the appreciation of the exchange rate of the euro on aggregate demand may be mitigated by the significant improvements in the terms of trade, as the lower import prices will be conducive to a pick-up in consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In addition, the effects of the changes in the exchange rate on trade are likely to be more than compensated for in the coming years by the expected acceleration in economic activity world-wide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.02,0)">On the latter aspects I should however not conceal that we also see some downside risks to the global recovery in economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Notably, the possible correction of macroeconomic imbalances in other major economies remains a factor of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.97,0)">In addition, we cannot exclude that the SARS epidemic may have negative supply and demand effects, although it is difficult at this juncture to assess the possible implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.76,0)">What does all this mean for the outlook for price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Obviously, prospective developments in economic activity should contribute to restraining inflationary pressure in the euro area in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In this respect, after a period of rising wage growth, despite a context of subdued economic growth in 2001 and early 2002, we have seen signs of stabilisation of wage growth more recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The effects of recent exchange rate developments will also make a significant contribution to reducing inflationary pressure, although some of the effects may be visible only with a certain time-lag.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Over the last couple of months, inflation has remained somewhat above 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.05,0)">We expect that, after hovering around 2% over the coming months, consumer price inflation should fall more significantly in 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Partly due to the high volatility observed in financial markets in the past, but also due to the low level of interest rates, the euro area economy has continued to accumulate liquid assets significantly above the amount needed to sustain non-inflationary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The concerns about this situation are, however, limited, at least as long as economic activity remains subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">The easing of geopolitical tensions and the recent stabilisation in financial markets should support an unwinding of these portfolio shifts over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In addition, the moderate growth in loans to the private sector indicates that the growth in monetary aggregates does not reflect internal demand dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.13,0)">Thus, overall, not least due to the appreciation of the euro, inflationary pressures have declined significantly over recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This assessment will be reflected in our deliberations on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As the organiser has asked me to also say a few words on the "policy mix" in the euro area, let me briefly conclude with some remarks on this topic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">I think that the macroeconomic policy framework in the euro area is appropriate to ensure sustained and non-inflationary economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Fiscal policy should contribute to maintaining an environment of macroeconomic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">At the same time, the monetary policy of the ECB takes into account the fiscal policy stance, as one of the factors which contribute to the outlook for price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In this respect, an efficient assignment of objectives and instruments, together with a clear division of responsibilities, is in place in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The policy objectives and the policy execution framework are known to all policy actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">An open exchange of views and information between individual policy actors can assist the overall outcome if this enhances an understanding of the objectives and strategies to pursue them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">However, there cannot be any scope for an active co-ordination of fiscal and monetary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.77,0)">Such active co-ordination is bound to be ineffective, given the inability of both fiscal and monetary policy-makers to fine tune economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.39,0)">Commitments to ex ante co-ordination between fiscal and monetary policies may blur the responsibilities of monetary and fiscal authorities and ultimately reduce their incentives to pursue their objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.15,0)">The economic outcome of such co-ordination is likely to be worse than the conduct of policies within the existing institutional set-up as only the latter ensures genuine accountability.</span>
