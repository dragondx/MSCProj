    <h1> The euro, its central bank  and economic governance </h1>
    <h2> Stamp Memorial Lecture by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB at the London School of Economics and Political Science London, 13 June 2011 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)"> The euro, its central bank and economic governance Stamp Memorial Lecture by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat the London School of Economics and Political ScienceLondon, 13 June 2011 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour for me to speak here at the London School of Economics and Political Science today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The euro and its central bank, the ECB, are unique.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The European single currency is the only major currency not issued by a single sovereign state, but by a union of sovereign states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.56,0)">Indeed, the European Treaties specify a clear division of responsibilities between European-level policy-making and national policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">For countries that have adopted the euro as their currency, this implies that, on the one hand, monetary policy is inherently indivisible, and in the euro area it is thus conducted at the supranational level by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">On the other hand, fiscal policies remain largely the competence of national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In this lecture I would like to explore how the unique institutional framework of Economic and Monetary Union   in Europe has fared over the past 12 years and particularly during the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As you will be aware, the primary objective of the European System of Central Banks is to maintain price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In the first part of my lecture I will show how the ECB achieved this primary objective before, during and after the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">I will also try to convince you that the economic performance of the euro area as a whole has been quite remarkable over the past twelve and a half years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">At the same time, we have to recognise that several individual countries in the euro area are facing significant challenges and that experiences during the crisis in different parts of the euro area have been quite diverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In the second part of my lecture, I will address the issue of economic diversity in the euro area and show that the euro area shares this characteristic with the United States – an economy and a currency area that is a natural reference point taking into account its size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.0,0)">Finally, the crisis has exposed weaknesses in the economic governance framework of EMU that need to be addressed urgently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I will close my lecture with some comments about what these reforms of the economic governance framework should look like from the perspective of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The ECB’s primary objective: Price stability in the euro area before and after the crisis I can say today that the ECB has fulfilled its primary objective to the letter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">As you know, the ECB aims at inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Annual inflation over the first 12 years of EMU has been 1.97% on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">A precision landing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">More generally, the degree of price stability has been greater, over the past 12 years, in the euro area as a whole than in the individual euro area countries over the previous 50 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This is no small achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.74,0)">The ECB has faced many challenges in pursuing its objective: the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the shock wave of 11 September 2001, the volatility of commodity prices and, of course, the worst financial crisis the world has known since the Second World War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.51,0)">During the crisis, together with other central banks around the world, the ECB has had to operate in an uncertain environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Allow me to explain our monetary policy response to the crisis in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Crucially, we were alert from the very first day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">We were one of the first central banks to react, when the financial markets became abruptly turbulent, in August 2007, taking action swiftly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.29,0)">Dysfunctional financial markets threatened to compromise our ability to guide the outlook for price stability by using only our conventional instrument – interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Faced with this situation, over the years that followed, we have implemented a number of unconventional measures to ensure that our decisions on interest rates are transmitted to the whole economy, despite the problems observed in the financial sector and capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In particular, the major task was to allow banks – regardless of the level of the key interest rate which was designed to deliver price stability – to continue to lend to households and businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It is important to understand that we maintained a principle of strict separation between our conventional measures and our unconventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Our interest rates are set so that we can ensure price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.6,0)">The implementation of unconventional measures depends on the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism and is intended to repair disruptions of monetary and financial markets and of specific market segments that might impede the overall transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">As the crisis called for rapid and unprecedented action, we did not lose sight of our main objective, namely to maintain price stability over the medium term for the benefit of the 331 million citizens of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">All – I stress that word – all monetary policy decisions we have taken over the last 12½ years were aimed at fulfilling this commitment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me elaborate on this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.65,0)">As you know, in normal times, central banks mainly influence the economy and inflation by using the instrument for setting short-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.17,0)">In practice, the identification, at an early stage, of the risks to price stability is a delicate task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">To see it through, the ECB bases itself on a monetary policy strategy supported by several sources of information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The economic analysis we undertake enables us to synthesise information on short-term inflationary pressures from a large number of economic indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Thanks to the monetary analysis that we also undertake, we can cross-check this information with medium-term inflationary pressures drawn from the monetary and financial indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">These are the two “pillars” of our monetary policy, which indicate to us the necessary steps in respect of the interest rate to ensure price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The measures we have taken, sometimes in the face of political pressures have demonstrated our determination to stick to our mandate in full independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.52,0)">We refused to lower interest rates in early 2004 when Germany, France and Italy in particular asked us to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">And we did not hesitate to raise interest rates in December 2005, a time when 10 governments out of 12 in the euro area, plus many international observers, asked the ECB to leave its key rates unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.85,0)">International financial institutions, in particular, highlighted the risks that the tightening of monetary policy – after a prolonged period of accommodative monetary policy – could pose to the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Despite these warnings, we conducted our monetary tightening, and international financial institutions, with the benefit of hindsight, have agreed that we were right to make that decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.08,0)">After the crisis escalated in mid-September 2008, while inflationary pressures subsided, we decided, in full accordance with our mandate, to reduce our key interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.58,0)">We cut it rapidly, from 4.25% in October 2008 to 1% in May 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.75,0)">We lowered the key interest rate at a pace and to a level unprecedented in the recent history of the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">With the benefit of hindsight, the decisions we took during the crisis were, I think, vindicated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">They have in particular helped to preserve a very solid anchoring of inflation expectations over the past four years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Our determination to maintain price stability over the medium term has enabled us to prevent both the risk of inflation and of deflation from materialising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.92,0)">With the recovery now more firmly established, we have seen in recent months upside risks to the outlook for price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.75,0)">Again, the sharp increase in oil and other commodities has had a major impact on overall inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.7,0)">In these circumstances, the central bank must prevent increases in the prices of raw materials from being incorporated into the long-term inflation expectations, which could trigger second-round effects on wages and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is against this background that the Governing Council decided in April to raise interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">I stressed, in reporting this decision, that it had been taken unanimously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The action of the Governing Council is motivated by a common goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">That decision in April confirmed that the separation principle is strictly applied and that our non-conventional measures do not restrict in any way our ability to toughen the monetary policy stance when facing inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Thus, when the Governing Council decided in April that it was time to raise interest rates, in parallel, at the same time, it decided to keep, in the second quarter, the provision of unlimited fixed-rate liquidity for a period of three months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Contributing to economic performance Price stability is the best contribution that central banks can make to sustainable economic growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">I think there is widespread agreement on this among central bankers and academic researchers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.84,0)">In the short run, however, some academic research suggests that there might be a significant trade-off between low inflation volatility and low output volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">If prices are stable, economic adjustment has to occur through the real economy channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.59,0)">It may therefore be difficult to achieve these two goals at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The chart shows that the euro area scores relatively well on both dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.39,0)">This is puzzling, given that the euro area has quite rigid product and labour markets, at least compared with the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The higher degree of price and wage rigidity in the euro area would suggest that output volatility should be significantly larger in the euro area than in the more flexible US economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.36,0)">This would be particularly true during a period when the economy is subject to supply-side shocks, which are simultaneously exerting inflationary and recessionary influences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Yet surprisingly, and despite the negative supply-side shocks that had been hitting the euro area economy over the years up to 2007, the data suggested that both inflation volatility and output volatility in the euro area were lower than elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Output volatility in the euro area is much higher when the crisis is included in the sample.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">But, remarkably, the euro area still scores well on both dimensions compared with other advanced countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.26,0)">How can we explain this puzzle?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.5,0)">How can nominal rigidities plus supply-side pressures not produce bad or worse macroeconomic outcomes?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">I believe that the strong anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area is the key to understanding this good economic performance of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Inflation expectations have remained solidly anchored in line with our definition of price stability throughout the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.07,0)">In particular, there was no materialisation of a deflation risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This has enormously facilitated our task, especially during the period of economic freefall in the winter of 2008/09.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Other indicators corroborate the finding that at the aggregate level the real economy of the euro has proved relatively dynamic in comparison with the US: real output per capita has grown at a similar pace in the euro area as in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Employment growth in the euro area has also been strong over the past 12 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">More than 14 million jobs have been created since the introduction of the euro, compared with 8 million in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.94,0)">This is not to suggest that there is time for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Unemployment at 9.9% of the labour force remains much too high, and structural reforms are of the essence to make the euro area economy much more flexible and to elevate its growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Finally, public finances in the euro area as a whole are relatively sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.21,0)">As elsewhere, the financial crisis has left its mark on government deficit and debt in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.88,0)">Yet, the fiscal deficit in the euro area on aggregate for this year is estimated at less than one half of that in the United States and Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.69,0)">One may argue, however that this bird’s eye view is misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">One common belief is that the US economy is more homogeneous than the economy of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.4,0)">In other words, aggregate economic data may hide very significant differences in the variance in economic performance across regions within a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Economic diversity in the euro area and the United States Looking more closely at the regional dispersion across US regions and euro area economies show that, contrary to what is generally perceived, the dispersion of many of the key indicators is similar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.75,0)">Let us take a look at the inflation indicator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The dispersion of HICP inflation in euro area countries remained broadly stable since the late 1990s, at a level similar to the 14 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">During the crisis we saw a temporary increase in inflation dispersion in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">As you can see, this has been reversed over the past 12 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.1,0)">The picture is similar for the dispersion of GDP growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.03,0)">Before the crisis the dispersion of growth rates was around 2%, in both the euro area and the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Dispersion rose somewhat during the crisis in both currency areas but remained broadly in line with pre-crisis patterns overall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.08,0)">Let us go one step further and investigate the sources of this growth dispersion in the US and euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.88,0)">This reveals parallels even in the root causes of dispersion in economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Both currency areas comprise regions that experienced a significant boom and bust cycle over the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Both also contain regions that are facing significant structural challenges of a more long-term nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Nevada, Arizona, Florida and California in the United States, for example, experienced increases in house prices that outpaced the national average by a wide margin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Steep house price increases and the related strong performance of real estate, construction and financial services probably contributed to above average growth in these states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Some other US states, particularly the former manufacturing powerhouses in the ''Great Lakes'' region, saw a long episode of below average growth at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.49,0)">Below average performance of the region – and particularly weaker growth rates in the states of Michigan and Ohio – are related to strong reliance on manufacturing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.45,0)">Structural shifts in the US economy towards services have gradually reduced the value added of manufacturing relative to GDP, with implications for areas with a high concentration of companies in manufacturing industries other than information and communications technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.18,0)">The sharp fall in house prices in Florida and the south-western US states turned boom into bust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.65,0)">These states experienced the harshest recession among the US states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.53,0)">But GDP growth in the ''Great Lakes'' region, which was below average before the crisis, also remained below average during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.1,0)">Some euro area countries experienced asymmetric boom-and-bust cycles similar to those just described in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Several euro area countries had higher than average growth in the pre-crisis years, while a few have experienced growth below the euro area average for the past decade due to structural issues that could have been tackled with more determination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The effect of the crisis on the different euro area economies follows a similar pattern to those of comparable US states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.29,0)">The countries in the euro area that have been hit hardest are those in which either large asset-bubble driven imbalances unwound or structural problems were left unaddressed before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.0,0)">More specifically, Ireland and Greece, in particular, remained in recession in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.34,0)">Those countries that have yet to implement more far reaching structural reforms also have relatively low growth prospects after the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.07,0)">Just a few years ago, Germany was – entirely wrongly – labelled the “sick man of Europe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Yet Germany is now an example of how big the dividends of reform can be if structural adjustment is made a strategic priority and implemented with sufficient patience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.06,0)">The relatively low growth rates in some countries are linked to a deterioration of competitiveness, driven, for example, by persistent above average unit labour costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.43,0)">Ahead of EMU, unit labour costs converged in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">What is more – disregarding the most recent countries to join the euro area – dispersion both ahead of the crisis and during the crisis was very similar in the euro area and the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.36,0)">At the same time, it is worth noting that both currency areas include regions with persistently above or below average growth of unit labour costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.51,0)">Again leaving aside the most recent countries to join the euro area, here, Greece, Portugal and Ireland, in particular, have lost competitiveness vis-à-vis their main trading partners in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Germany, in contrast, has been able to lower relative unit labour costs over the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.38,0)">Similar persistent losses and gains in competitiveness are also observed in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Some states have experienced large or persistent increases in unit labour costs, currently exceeding the national average by as much as 20%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Other states, on the other hand, have been gaining competitiveness vis-à-vis the national average over the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.04,0)">In summary, these results suggest that those who are questioning the viability of the euro area as a single currency area on the grounds of economic heterogeneity are misguided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Over the past 12 years, this has been broadly similar in the euro area and the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This should, however, be no reason for any complacency in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.21,0)">As the crisis has taught us, persistent losses in competitiveness on the part of individual members in a currency union lead to a build-up of external and internal imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.61,0)">When these unravel, the cost for the affected economies can be very large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.54,0)">They can also have spillover effects on other members of the currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.55,0)">In any union, an economic governance framework is needed to prevent developments in an individual member state endangering the smooth functioning of the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.62,0)">But for EMU, the economic governance framework devised in the 1990s has not been implemented and, in any case, has proved too weak during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The crisis has exposed a clear need for strong reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">As I speak today the reform debate is still in progress, and in the last part of my lecture, I would like to talk briefly about the present reform of economic governance in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.86,0)">Economic governance in the euro area The existing economic governance framework has been incorrectly implemented and, more importantly, has proved to be insufficiently binding while lacking appropriate comprehensiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Today’s reform of the governance framework has to take the current constitutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">We have to accept this situation as a given, at least for the foreseeable future, even if I am convinced that we have already to reflect upon further steps for economic governance in the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Today, we have to empower the institutional arrangements that are already in place to the point at which they can really and durably inspire confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The requirements for a very significant reinforcement of the fiscal surveillance of the Stability and Growth Pact and for the creation of a new surveillance of competitive indicators and macroeconomic policy have been discussed widely and in much detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">As you may know, the ECB takes the strong view that there is the need for more speed and automaticity in the sanctioning mechanism, particularly in the Stability and Growth Pact, but also in the broader macroeconomic policy surveillance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The experience of the past months has vividly demonstrated the importance of a timely correction of internal and external imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Beyond faster and more automatic sanctions, the enforcement tools also need to be more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The macroeconomic surveillance framework, in particular, needs to provide clear incentives by imposing financial sanctions at an early stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.51,0)">This also means that there should be no room for discretion in the implementation of the surveillance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">At the same time, requirements for fiscal and other macroeconomic policies should be more ambitious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">To ensure that none of the euro area countries are left behind, they have to bring national policies in line with membership of a currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The implementation of sound fiscal and macroeconomic policies is best ensured if these are solidly anchored at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">An effective way of achieving this is to implement strong national budgetary frameworks in the euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Another important area of reform, at the global level, is the reform of financial governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">I have to say that on financial reform we have made relatively rapid progress at the global and European levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">As you know, we have drawn up a set of more stringent banking regulations, more ambitious capital requirements to absorb losses, improving coverage and reducing the risk of excessive borrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The countercyclical capital buffers are designed to reduce pro-cyclicality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">At the same time, the supervision of financial institutions, financial markets and market infrastructure has been tightened, and the organisational structure of financial oversight has been overhauled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The European Systemic Risk Board  , which I chair together with Mervyn King, and the European Supervisory Authorities   – the three new authorities created for the European banking sector, insurance and occupational pensions, and capital markets – have taken up their work at the beginning of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The ESRB is in the process of developing the tools necessary to warn and, if appropriate, make recommendations as regards systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">And the ESAs will allow closer monitoring of the interrelationships within the EU’s financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.71,0)">But much remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Most importantly, we need to ensure the full implementation of the envisioned reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In addition, key areas where work is still in progress – not only at the European, but also at global level – include: the treatment of systemically important financial institutions; the mechanism of bank crisis management and resolution; oversight of the shadow banking system; and – very importantly – the further regulation and oversight of financial markets and their functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.81,0)">Europe’s European Union on the one hand and European Economic and Monetary Union on the other hand have always had their critics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.08,0)">For example, as regards EMU, some have argued that a single currency was inappropriate for a continent that is economically more heterogeneous than the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.67,0)">And some have claimed that the ECB would not be able to set appropriate interest rates for the euro area to maintain price stability and contribute a

competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.3,0)">As I have said, none of this should make us complacent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The sovereign debt crises in three smaller euro area countries underline the urgency of a far-reaching overhaul of the fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance institutions in Europe.</span><span style="background-color:
