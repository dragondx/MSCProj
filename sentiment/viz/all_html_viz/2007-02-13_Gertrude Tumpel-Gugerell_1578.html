    <h3> Speaker: Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)"> The European Central Bank’s view on SEPA Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBColloquium « Mise en place du SEPA : quel bénéfice pour l'Europe ?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">»Sénat français, Palais du Luxembourg, Paris, 13 February 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Mr Chairman, Senators, Ladies and Gentlemen: Thank you for giving me the opportunity to present the views of the European Central Bank on the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">When Jean Monnet, that outstanding Frenchman and great European, was asked what he would do differently if he could shape the process of European integration again, his answer was: “I would start with culture”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.37,0)">We do not know why he answered like this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.91,0)">Was it because he became aware of all the hurdles which stem from different perceptions, perspectives and lack of trust?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Or was it because he thought starting with cultural integration would make European integration easier and long-lasting?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">European integration did not start with culture, but with the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Today, just a few weeks before the 50th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome  , the free movement of capital and goods has been well and truly achieved, but other elements of the Treaty, like the free movement of services and workers, exist only on paper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.03,0)">European integration is clearly unfinished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.14,0)">The introduction of the euro as the single currency of Europe was seen as a political project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">However it has resulted in deeper economic relations, created confidence and brought economic and monetary stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">SEPA is a new political project – European consumers, companies and other economic actors will be able to make and receive payments in euro throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">As a result, SEPA will make payments more efficient, faster and in the medium term less expensive, although fees could become more visible than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Today you have heard all about the pieces of the puzzle which belong to the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">A project that is even more complex than the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.33,0)">Where do we stand today?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.27,0)">The puzzle is half-finished – the framework has been set up, but much of the substance is still missing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The missing pieces will require all the energy of the players involved for a couple of years more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">=> Slide 2   In my speech I will focus on three issues: Can commercial banks establish SEPA by themselves?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.01,0)">What is the role of the public sector?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Is there a need for speed, or can we sit back and relax?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The Eurosystem’s main goals for SEPA => Slide 3   SEPA is an area in which consumers, companies and other economic actors will be able to make and receive payments in euro, both across and within national boundaries, under the same basic conditions, rights and obligations, regardless of their location.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">The aim of SEPA is to complete the introduction of the euro as the single currency and to advance European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">This is to be achieved by creating a competitive and innovative euro area retail payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">This market will offer higher service levels and more efficient products for making payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">=> Slide 4   SEPA consists of the single currency, a single set of euro payment instruments – credit transfers, direct debits and card payments, efficient processing infrastructures for euro payments, common technical standards, common business practices, a harmonised legal basis, and ongoing development of new customer-oriented services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Now, let me turn to the first issue I would like to discuss today – the role of the commercial banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.72,0)">Can banks do it alone?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Although SEPA is a political project, the European Payments Council and the national banking communities are doing a lot of the work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But can banks do it by themselves?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Yes!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Self-regulation and industry commitment have proven to be new ways of changing the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">The European Payments Council has taken up – with high commitment - the task of making SEPA a reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">When I review the state of play today, I see that the SEPA preparations are well under way; however, key steps still lie ahead of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Banks are working on their product offerings, which they will launch on Tuesday 1 January 2008, exactly 46 weeks from now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In this respect, the credit transfer scheme has reached the end of the definition process and is now being implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The same holds for the direct debit schemes, although here an important issue is still open.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Without going into details, the ECB would like to see the option of a debtor bank driven mandate flow for direct debits introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For both schemes, testing will start in a few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">However, customer involvement in the development of the new products still needs to be organised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.89,0)">And user awareness of SEPA is still limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The infrastructures are preparing as well, with some signs in the market that true SEPA players are evolving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">But some infrastructures appear to think that they can continue processing national payments only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And it is a pity that not all infrastructures have joined the work on standardisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Card schemes are planning for the future; they will need to operate on a SEPA level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But, in contrast to the rulebooks for credit transfers and direct debits, the EPC has only developed a framework for cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.59,0)">Whether a true SEPA for cards will be established in January 2008 remains therefore uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But this new framework will guide card schemes on how they will need to operate on a SEPA level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">=> Slide 5   Regulation No 2560/2001 as example of successful political intervention Despite the success of the self-regulatory approach, we should not forget what triggered it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Self-regulation and industry commitment have been the responses to the well-known Regulation No 2560/2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is a guarantee to consumers that when they make a payment in euro for a good or service in another Member State it will cost the same as it would have done in their own country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.21,0)">The same guarantee applies when they withdraw money from cash dispensers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.59,0)">This Regulation was adopted by the European Council of Ministers and the European Parliament after years of disappointment with a lack of integration in the field of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As prices for cross-border transactions did not drop significantly after the formation of the internal market in 1993, the European authorities started to monitor developments more closely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">The continued high fees for cross-border payments led to the adoption of this Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The intervention by the public authorities was strong and it has worked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.84,0)">A recent evaluation by the European Commission addresses to what extent cross-border charges have fallen since the adoption of the Regulation and whether bank charges to customers for national payments have increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">The analysis concludes that charges have dropped dramatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">At the same time, contrary to some concerns, charges for national payments have not increased to compensate for the reduced revenue from the cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This shows that public intervention is sometimes a catalyst for change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Opening up markets is key While a Regulation was issued to set in motion the politically desired changes, a self-regulatory approach is required to develop a sound business model for SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let us not forget that retail payments cannot be compared with a public utility service, but are offered in a genuine market environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">However, almost all markets need a framework to enable them to function properly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">A set of market rules should apply to create a level playing field, and the rules should be enforced to avoid anti-competitive behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Before I consider the market rules, I wish to focus on obstacles in the market and on anti-competitive behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.13,0)">Real split between scheme and infrastructure The current national or scheme-bound orientation in payments has created some impregnable silos, in which scheme and proprietary processing are combined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.23,0)">Each silo is owned and controlled by groups of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.38,0)">These banks have no incentive to change because of the potential loss of invested capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.76,0)">For outsiders, this fragmented and closed market structure imposes a huge barrier to entry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">The common standards that the EPC has developed for payment instruments and for clearing and settlement mechanisms should make more competition possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">And as a consequence, payment schemes will benefit from more efficient processing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">=> Slide 6   Therefore, the Eurosystem has called for a split between scheme and infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This split should be at least financial and more than superficial: no cross-subsidisation between scheme and processing should exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Furthermore, important scheme requirements as combating fraud should be organised in a processor-neutral way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.27,0)">Finally, the former proprietary processor should not be placed at an information-advantage concerning scheme changes which will require processing changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.84,0)">In some cases a split has been made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">However, it is doubtful whether these changes are more than cosmetic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.0,0)">The processing centres of most card schemes   remain proprietary or closely linked to the scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.0,0)">Also, proprietary Automated Clearing House   processing is an obstacle to competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Possible fragmentation by AOS and/or ACHs, transparency needed A potential second obstacle in the market is the development of Additional Optional Services, or AOS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The EPC has developed, as I mentioned before, new schemes for credit transfers and direct debits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">These schemes will be used by banks to provide payment products all over the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">A market-driven migration to these new products will start as soon as they are introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In some countries however, the core and basic SEPA products will have to be enhanced by AOS in order to bring the new products up to the same level of quality as experienced today by the respective banking communities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">It will ease the SEPA migration in these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.55,0)">The additional optional services may however be a threat to a true SEPA, since they could maintain the national orientation of payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Therefore transparency is key, especially when these services are introduced at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">I am pleased the EPC has recognised the need for transparency and has started to address this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.84,0)">A third obstacle is a continued differentiation between ‘domestic’ and intra-EU cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.06,0)">This could happen if the operating rules of the automated clearing houses were still to make this distinction, or if national legal obligations were to prescribe the use of specific payment systems or message formats.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.49,0)">National banking communities or national authorities should not prevent other banks or infrastructures from entering the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">A SEPA for cards Fourthly, the proper functioning of the market for SEPA card payments needs some additional elements: clarity regarding multilateral interchange fees, even though the Sector Inquiry Report of the European Commission provided guidance the availability at the European scale of an alternative processing network card standardisation, the willingness of all market players to work on new initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.77,0)">=> Slide 7   The Eurosystem has voiced its expectations regarding SEPA for cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">There should be consumer choice, competitive markets and no geographical segmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Most importantly, the Eurosystem expects at least one European card scheme to emerge in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The Eurosystem welcomes the fact that the EPC is starting to work on standardisation for cards; this is needed urgently to create a European market for point-of-sale terminals and for cards acquiring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The Eurosystem welcomes the efforts of the international card schemes in preparing for SEPA and the SEPA changes they have already announced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Although the ECB does not favour any particular initiative, the Eurosystem appreciates the work being done by the Euro Alliance of Payment Schemes to establish interoperability between the participating card schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">This work can be seen as the first step towards a consolidation of card schemes, leading to a European card scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The Eurosystem expects one or more European card schemes to emerge in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">For the emergence of new European card schemes it is paramount that all European banking communities work together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Given the good track record of the French banking community in the cards business, the Eurosystem expects that they will be actively promote the creation of an integrated European cards market, and will help to build a true SEPA for cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Now, let me turn to the second point of my presentation: the participation of the public sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Public sector participation I mentioned the need for a sound set of rules to let the market function properly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">As some of you are members of the Senate, you will be aware how important sound legislation is for the proper conduct of business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.78,0)">=> Slide 8   It is therefore very unfortunate that the adoption of the Payment Services Directive is delayed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.39,0)">The ongoing debate on the multilateral interchange fee from a competition policy point of view has created some complications in the planning process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">We are pleased however that the European Network of Competition Authorities is now addressing these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.1,0)">PSD delay => direct debit delay The role of the European Parliament was discussed earlier today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.72,0)">I mentioned the delay in the adoption of the PSD.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The ECB has followed this dossier closely in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">To us, it seems that the relevant articles for SEPA are relatively stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.08,0)">It is more on the issues of payment institutions that debates are ongoing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">As all SEPA-relevant aspects of the Directive are seen as uncontroversial, we believe that even if the PSD is not adopted, banks can work on the development and implementation of SEPA and, in particular, its direct debit products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.33,0)">The actual offering of the products, especially in the cross-border context, would however be difficult without the PSD having been adopted and transposed into national law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">We have nevertheless heard from several banks that SEPA direct debit products could be rolled out by 1 January 2008 in a purely national context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This would certainly help to achieve critical mass, which is necessary to process this new SEPA payment instrument efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For instance, tax authorities, which are domestic players only, can immediately use the SEPA direct debit for tax collection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">They are not faced with a multi-country and multi-jurisdiction “client base”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For corporates with a multi-country base the approach will be different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">=> Slide 9   MIF Another issue in which legal clarity is vital is the possibility and the extent to which banks can rely on multilateral interchange fees to set up viable and mutually beneficial payment schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The Commission feels that the Sector Inquiry Report, together with the forthcoming MasterCard decision and the Cartes Bancaires case, will provide sufficient guidance to the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.65,0)">In general, the Sector Inquiry Report focuses on the possibility of misuse of interchange fees   based on market power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The Commission is not against interchange fees per se.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">This has been emphasised by the responsible Commissioner, Ms Kroes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.36,0)">She has publicly stated, referring to interchange fees, that the European Commission is “not arguing for their abolition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.97,0)">But it is clear that the present level of interchange fees in many of the schemes we have examined does not seem justified”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Market participants and public authorities need to come to a mutual understanding..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Such a mutual understanding could be based on a framework which would provide clarity on the use of multilateral interchange fees   in payment schemes as well as on their calculation methodology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It should be founded on ‘payment-economics’, meaning the understanding of the way the market functions with regards to payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This framework should then be agreed in principle by competition authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">For example, the concept of a MIF could be endorsed as a means to balance the revenue-cost ratios between issuer and acquirer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">This would make the offering of the payment instrument beneficial to both banks involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">As a consequence, innovative payment schemes can be introduced in the market and can be properly maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">From a payment system policy view, this is an important goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">In this market, competition and the drive for efficiency will still be very much alive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Take-up of the new products by public administrations Public authorities in Europe have played a major role in the formulation of the SEPA concept, but are lagging behind in preparing for its implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Public authorities initiate more than 20% of all retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Given the fact that reaching a critical mass is vital for the efficiency of payment systems, public authorities could play a huge role in the SEPA migration by becoming launching customers of, or early adapters to, the new SEPA instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">=> Slide 10   On this point, I would like to compliment the French banking community, the Banque de France and the French public authorities working together on the preparations for SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">All are active participants in the French national committee for SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">I hope this active involvement of the public authorities will lead to an early use of the SEPA products, and so be a stimulus to the success of the entire SEPA project in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Now, let me turn to my final point: how quickly do we need SEPA?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.39,0)">Does it matter how quickly banks move?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I would say: as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.45,0)">The aims of SEPA are too important to accept delays in the implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">All efforts should aim to deliver the SEPA products as of 1 January 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The momentum that has been gained in recent years should be maintained for the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.66,0)">Individual banks should not try to find excuses for not delivering on time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">And they should also be well aware that some banks, in particular the internationally active banks, already have made substantial investments in developing their SEPA product offerings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">These internationally oriented banks see the great opportunities SEPA has to offer them and their clients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">=> Slide 11   SEPA benefits To get a clearer insight into the benefits of SEPA, which is the main topic of this Colloquium today, the ECB has initiated a SEPA impact study.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The aim of the impact study is to carefully analyse the possible economic implications that SEPA may have for the various stakeholders, and mainly the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.67,0)">At present, only an estimation or, at best, limited information is available to measure the economic opportunities and challenges of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The ECB tries to enrich and complete its understanding about the potential economic consequences of SEPA for different scenarios and stages of the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Furthermore, it envisages providing a clear picture of the expected economic impact for major SEPA stakeholders, and in particular for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.47,0)">The preliminary conclusions from the impact study are: The overall impact on costs and revenues for the banking industry is broadly moderate and less substantial than is often assumed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.88,0)">The financial impact of SEPA varies according to different scenarios and stages of the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.64,0)">In the short run, the co-existence of SEPA schemes in parallel with the national schemes is expected to lead to initial investment costs and a relatively neutral impact on the revenue side for the banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In the longer term, when national schemes are replaced by SEPA schemes, the costs for banks are expected to decrease because of potential economies of scale and scope and innovations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.4,0)">The revenue side will however also be   affected as competition will increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Moreover, it seems that the impact on costs and revenues will be determined by the approach chosen by the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Banks that take a forward-looking view and opt for additional services which will automate the payment process will create new business opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The changes which are required in the initial phase of setting up SEPA are substantial, and benefits can be reaped especially by those institutions that embrace new technological developments and provide innovative services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The ECB SEPA impact study shows that a short dual period is needed to reduce costs of SEPA migration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.1,0)">=> Slide 12   Market-driven consolidation The Eurosystem sees that SEPA is a market-driven process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">All market barriers to open and fair competition should be removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The European market will be big enough for four to six ACHs to achieve economies of scale  , good business cases and good value propositions to their clients  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">A market-driven consolidation should also take place in the ‘market’ for card schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">However, the Eurosystem expects that the European market will be big enough to host more than two SEPA-compliant card schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Separate from the schemes, the processing of card transactions should consolidate to reach economies of scale, while remaining a competitive market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In the longer term, alignments could be sought in the clearing and settlement of giro payments   and the clearing and settlement of card payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">End-to-end STP payments  , e-invoicing, e&m payments SEPA operations and technology were also discussed this morning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.29,0)">The SEPA project is not a ‘one-shot operation”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It is an effort taking several years, which aims to make the current fragmented euro retail payments markets into a single domestic market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The EPC is developing the building blocks upon which the SEPA project is founded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Now that these building blocks are almost in place, it is time to move the retail payment market to the next level – an electronic environment where the SEPA payment instruments are used electronically and are combined with value-added services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Our challenge is to take full advantage of the technologies in place and offer customers convenient, secure and efficient services that will make their lives easier and at the same time will benefit the economy by securing end-to-end straight-through processing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is what we refer to as eSEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">To be truly successful with SEPA we must strengthen the cooperation between the different stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">We must act now and agree on common standards that will ensure that any electronic device – mobile telephones, internet, PDAs   etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">can be used for value-added services and thereby guarantee that the whole value-chain from customer-to-bank-to-customer is paper- and cash-free.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Direct charging of payment transactions The introduction of the SEPA instruments could coincide with the introduction of greater transparency in the pricing of payment products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The ECB believes that transparency in services and prices would add crucial information for customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">=> Slide 13   The introduction of more direct charging for payment transactions is however not something to be taken lightly by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It takes time and effort to make customers aware, especially if they are used to the idea that making a payment is completely free of charge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude by mentioning once again the Eurosystem’s main policy goal and the key measures for making SEPA a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">=> Slide 14   Re-statement of key policy messages from the speech The aim of SEPA is to complete the introduction of the euro as the single currency and to support European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The self-regulatory approach chosen for SEPA is working well, even though it took a European Regulation to set the process in motion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">The preparations by banks, infrastructures and card schemes are now well under way, but important steps still lie ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Public authorities can support the project by providing legal clarity to the market with the Payment Services Directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Furthermore, they should be among the early users of the new SEPA payment instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">The first benefits to come from SEPA will be the new SEPA instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Secondly, SEPA will create a European playing field, which will bring significant economies of scale, mainly in processing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">But markets need to be opened up to foster competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">A third benefit is that SEPA will allow for the introduction of payment innovations that respond to the needs of European customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">And finally, the SEPA will provide benefits for banks, especially to those banks that quickly seize the opportunities that SEPA offers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Thank you for your attention!</span>
