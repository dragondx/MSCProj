    <span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)"> Introductory Statement   at a dinner with members of the Internationaler Club of Frankfurter Wirtschaftsjournalisten Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 10 July 2007 I The external environment Global economic activity continues to be robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">For major emerging markets the indicators point to a continued expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.11,0)">Short-term indicators for the US economy continue to suggest a bottoming out of the US economy in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Global inflation developments remain strongly influenced by changes in commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.24,0)">Overall, risks to global inflation remain on the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Real economy and price developments in the euro area Recent data support the baseline scenario of a robust and broadly based expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">With a declining unemployment rate and employment expectations pointing to continued job creation in the second quarter, the labour market situation continues to improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.1,0)">Capacity utilisation survey measures point to emerging constraints in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.19,0)">The balance of risks to the inflation outlook is clearly on the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.39,0)">Survey and hard data for input and output prices suggest price pressures both in the manufacturing and services sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Although latest labour cost indicators continue to point to contained wage developments, a pick up in wage growth is likely over the course of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.07,0)">Impact of global factors on domestic inflation: Downward pressure of globalisation on euro area manufacturing import prices is not yet receding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Monetary developments and financing conditions Monetary and credit growth remain robust and continue to point to upside risks to price stability in the medium- to longer-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The continued moderation in the growth of M1 and loans to households suggests that monetary developments are being influenced by previous interest rate increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The real cost of financing of non-financial corporations in the euro area remains at a rather low level from a historical perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">II The monetary and economic analysis of the ECB The ECB has adopted a broad based approach encompassing economic, financial markets and monetary indicators, as well as time-series models and structural models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This wealth of information is organised in terms of our economic and monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Within the economic analysis, the Macroeconomic Projections are the main organising framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">They are largely informed by independent sources of evidence  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The macroeconomic models used within the process mainly serve the purpose of ensuring coherence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Within the monetary analysis, a thorough analysis of all indicators of monetary trends helps to identify at an early stage shifts in underlying inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.77,0)">The policy-relevant information in money regarding the outlook for price developments is in the persistent trends of monetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.48,0)">Technological innovation, globalisation, demographics and policy reform, inter alia – are altering the behaviour of the euro area and global economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.34,0)">Such structural forces are changing the way inflation is determined and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Obviously these forces have important implications for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is important that these implications encompass both the monetary analysis and the economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.75,0)">However, challenges are often portrayed as particularly large for the monetary analysis  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.19,0)">This is simply not correct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Structural changes have also had relatively profound implications for aspects of the economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">To give two examples:   the impact of domestic economic slack on inflation may have diminished   and   the pass-through of exchange rate movements to domestic price dynamics has moderated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Such developments on the economic analysis side must also be better understood and factored into policy discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The ECB therefore constantly works on enhancing both the economic as well as the monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.13,0)">III Globalisation and monetary policy Over the medium to long-term, inflation is a monetary phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.44,0)">Globalisation may only impact relative prices, over a temporary period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.74,0)">Evidence on the importance of global slack in the determination of inflation is not conclusive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.13,0)">If domestic slack is less important, emerging domestic inflationary pressures take longer to become evident.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The need for a central bank to stabilise inflation expectations and act in a pre-emptive manner becomes even more important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">IV Economic governance in the EU The EMU countries can only reap the full benefits afforded by monetary union and the single market if all political players respect the treaty and act in accordance with their mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The EC Treaty assigns clear responsibilities to both monetary and economic policy in the EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The ECB with its single monetary policy for the euro area has been assigned the task of maintaining price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.48,0)">In contrast, economic policies are in national responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">However, member states have to coordinate their measures to achieve the goals of the treaty laid down in Article A further coordination of economic policies in the euro area could be fruitful exercise given the lack of possible adjustments via the exchange rate channel within the institutional framework of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, mandates for monetary and economic policies should not be mixed up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Price stability can only be delivered by a fully independent central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The European Council’s recent decision to confirm the inclusion of price stability in the list of the Union’s objectives was important to underpin the existing monetary policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">The EU leaders also agreed to annex a new protocol to the Treaties, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">This protocol underlines that an Internal Market which includes a system ensuring that competition is not distorted is indispensable for the good functioning of the EU economies.</span>
