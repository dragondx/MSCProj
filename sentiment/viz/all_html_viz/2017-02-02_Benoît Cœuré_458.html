    <span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)"> Outlook for monetary policy in the euro area Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Association d’Économie Financière, Paris, 2 February 2017 Introduction In my remarks tonight, I would like to discuss the outlook for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">As you will be aware, the Governing Council decided in December to extend the asset purchase programme with average monthly purchases of €60 billion from April this year until December 2017 or beyond, if necessary, and in any case until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with its inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">That decision was confirmed at our January meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The decision to extend the asset purchase programme was based on our assessment of the current economic climate, and our view of the amount of stimulus required to reach our inflation objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Before I discuss those points in a little more detail, allow me to refresh your memories of the events that have unfolded since the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In particular, I’d like to briefly recount why unconventional monetary policy measures became necessary, and how the ECB has responded to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Why unconventional measures became necessary The need for unconventional policy measures in the euro area arose from the confluence of a number of factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.04,0)">Broadly speaking, these factors fall into three categories: 1) weak domestic demand and the impairment of the monetary policy transmission mechanism arising from the financial and sovereign debt crises; 2) other factors weighing on inflation, notably energy prices; 3) the decline in equilibrium real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.79,0)">Weak domestic demand and impairment of monetary policy transmission Let me start with the financial crisis, which entered a particularly acute phase following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.52,0)">The ensuing severe recession across the euro area increased unemployment and, combined with falling real estate prices, caused large losses in many national banking sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.39,0)">The financial crisis was exacerbated by the banking-sovereign nexus, sometimes called the diabolical loop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">The large overhang of public debt in some countries, in part a result of the support provided to their banking systems, resulted in a marked widening of sovereign spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Markets began pricing in some risk of redenomination: in other words, the risk that certain countries would leave the euro area and revert to national currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.46,0)">At the same time, bank holdings of sovereign bonds came under increasing market scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.26,0)">Interbank lending markets in the euro area became fragmented and certain national banking systems lost access to wholesale market funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.99,0)">The fragmentation of the interbank market and sharply rising yields in some countries impaired the transmission of monetary policy and threatened the unity of monetary policy throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.88,0)">Credit to the private sector contracted and the euro area entered a further recession, with unemployment peaking in early 2013 at just over 12%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.05,0)">The output gap – the difference between current levels of economic activity and its long-run potential – reached a position well into negative territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.83,0)">Additional factors weighing on inflation Beyond the downward pressure on inflation from domestic sources, a number of other factors also weighed on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.13,0)">In particular, energy and other commodity prices fell sharply from the middle of 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.75,0)">Headline HICP inflation turned negative in December 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Our mandate is to maintain price stability over the medium term, so short-term movements in volatile components of the index do not necessarily require a monetary policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.96,0)">Indeed, the full transmission of monetary policy to inflation takes more than a year, but the initial impact of energy price changes no longer has an effect on the annual inflation rate after a year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.28,0)">So there is a real risk that any monetary policy action might only take effect when the main impact on headline inflation has already passed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.57,0)">As such, monetary policy could exacerbate volatility in inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.72,0)">Conversely, there is a risk that movements in headline inflation caused by a succession of energy price shocks could become entrenched in wage bargaining and inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.6,0)">Inflation expectations drifting away from our objective interferes with monetary policy’s ability to meet that objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.32,0)">As a result, monetary policy typically reacts to energy price movements by “looking through” their first-round, direct impact, but remaining vigilant regarding any second-round effects on expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This is certainly a description that fits the actions of the ECB at the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.47,0)">While the domestic recession and falling energy prices are the major underlying reasons for the low rates of inflation recorded since 2014, there are a number of additional contributory factors, including the flow-through of generally weak global demand and certain industry-specific factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">I won’t detail them today, except to mention that the European System of Central Banks has carried out a significant body of research on the subject, which was published last week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.31,0)">Decline in equilibrium interest rates Economists use a concept called, variously, the equilibrium real rate or the natural rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.61,0)">It represents the interest rate at which there is neither upward nor downward pressure on economic activity and hence on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.15,0)">Broadly speaking, when inflation is above the objective, central banks raise short-term real interest rates above the natural rate to bring inflation down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.23,0)">Symmetrically, when inflation is below the objective, central banks lower real interest rates below the natural rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.92,0)">While the equilibrium real rate is a useful concept in order to frame policy discussions, it is unobservable in the real world, and various models used to construct it provide different answers resulting in a range of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.67,0)">What is more certain, however, from these models is that the equilibrium real rate has been falling, both here and across other major advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.82,0)">By some estimates, it might even currently be negative in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.26,0)">As I have mentioned previously, potential reasons for this decline include demographics and falling productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.88,0)">Policy rates need to shadow this decline in the real equilibrium rate, otherwise monetary policy would be too tight, dampening activity and causing inflation to undershoot our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">How the ECB has responded to the crisis With these factors in mind, let me briefly summarise how the ECB has responded to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">We have taken action within our mandate to ensure sufficient stimulus is in place to return inflation to our objective over our medium-term horizon, and to repair the transmission of that stimulus across the whole euro area in order to preserve the unity of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.92,0)">In a conventional fashion, we gradually lowered our main refinancing rate to stimulate the economy, eventually reaching 0% in March 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">However, the size of the stimulus required, combined with the lower equilibrium real rate, meant that this interest rate cut was not sufficient to bring inflation back to our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.65,0)">It was therefore necessary to introduce a number of unconventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">First, we introduced forward guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">We communicated explicitly to the market our expectation that interest rates would remain at, or below, the current rate until inflation had sustainably returned to our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">In doing so, we were able to influence market views of our future interest rates, thereby reducing interest rates across the curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Indeed, while economists tend to talk in terms of one natural rate, there is, in truth, a wide constellation of interest rates that are relevant for the consumption and investment decisions of businesses and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Second, we introduced an asset purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">By buying bonds, including covered, sovereign and corporate bonds, we are reducing interest rates across a range of horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">These lower interest rates encourage borrowing, either indirectly through banks or directly in terms of greater issuance of corporate bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">In terms of the transmission mechanism, we introduced full allotment for our monetary policy tenders, allowing banks to access all the liquidity they need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">We also introduced measures to encourage banks to lend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.27,0)">We took the interest rate on our deposit facility into negative territory, meaning that banks have to pay to leave cash deposited with us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">In addition, we introduced a range of targeted long-term repos designed to explicitly reward banks for increasing lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Evidence that our monetary policy is working Let me now turn to the current economic situation in the euro area, and what it means for the monetary policy outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The monetary stimulus put in place by the ECB is clearly working, supporting a broad-based and resilient recovery in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Since the beginning of 2015, euro area GDP growth has been solid in every quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The preliminary flash estimate for the fourth quarter of 2016 is 0.5%, with similar growth expected in the first quarter of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The December Eurosystem staff projections for GDP growth were 1.7% for this year, and 1.6% for both 2018 and 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The Economic Sentiment Indicator rose in January to its highest level since 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Sentiment improved in industry, services and the household sector, mainly driven by improved sentiment regarding future economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">New industrial orders increased in November, with a notable pick-up in new export orders over the past year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">More broadly, global activity and trade gathered positive momentum in the second half of 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The recovery has also supported employment growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.15,0)">The unemployment rate fell to 9.6% in December, its lowest rate since May 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.19,0)">Over four million more Europeans are employed now than was the case three years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.17,0)">There are signs, too, that our measures to restore the monetary policy transmission mechanism and unblock the flow of credit to the economy are taking hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.32,0)">Lending rates have steadily declined throughout the euro area and the dispersion of rates across countries has narrowed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Credit provision continues to strengthen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Annual growth in credit to euro area households increased in December to 2.0% and growth in credit to businesses rose to 2.3% – the highest growth rates in more than four years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Lower lending rates and the recovery in activity have bolstered corporate profitability, with a consequent increase in investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Inflation has also increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The flash estimate for euro area annual HICP inflation in January is 1.8%, 0.7 percentage points higher than the December final estimate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.33,0)">But most of the increase in headline inflation has come from energy prices; core inflation in the flash estimate remained subdued at 0.9%, the same as in December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.12,0)">As I discussed earlier, monetary policymakers have to look through the first-round, direct impact of energy prices on headline inflation, and instead focus on the second-round effects on inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">As a result, we will treat the current increase in energy prices in a symmetrical fashion to how we treated the fall in 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Short-term inflation expectations have also increased in recent months, but still remain below our objective, while long-run expectations remain firmly anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Based on this, the Governing Council continues to expect interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time, and well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Outlook for monetary policy Indeed, the Governing Council has said for a long time that appropriate stimulus will remain in place until inflation has converged sustainably towards our objective of below, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">What do we mean by sustainably?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Well, it relates to our objective and how we have always carried out our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me highlight the four criteria that the President set out at the January press conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Inflation needs to converge towards our objective over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As mentioned earlier, the relevant horizon for monetary policy is the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.64,0)">We do not react to short-term fluctuations, particularly those caused by energy and other commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The convergence towards our objective needs to be durable – one swallow does not a summer make.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">We need to see clear evidence that once inflation returns to our objective, it will remain there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The third criterion is that inflation needs to be self-sustaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">We have witnessed an increasingly resilient recovery in economic activity, but this has not as yet translated into a resilient increase in inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.05,0)">Inflation in the euro area is still reliant on the substantial amount of monetary stimulus provided by the ECB, and it would be inappropriate to withdraw the stimulus while that reliance remains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Finally, the ECB’s mandate covers the whole euro area, and our policy reflects that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What matters to us is the euro area-wide measure of inflation, not the outturns for individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Conclusion In conclusion, monetary policy is currently set appropriately to ensure a return to our inflation objective in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Recovery in the euro area is resilient, but risks relating to the international environment remain elevated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">We will continue to monitor closely the evolution of prices and costs in the coming weeks and months in order to assess any second-round effects of energy prices and also to judge the extent to which the increase in inflation represents a sustainable adjustment towards our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And let me make one final point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">For the past few years, growth in the euro area has been sustained by substantial support from monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Yet in the long run, growth is not determined by monetary policy, but by innovation and gains in productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Structural reforms are needed in the euro area, and in each member state to improve the economic resilience to shocks and to boost productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Higher productivity growth will raise equilibrium real interest rates and, more importantly, improve welfare for everyone in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">and Osbat, C.
