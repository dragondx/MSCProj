    <span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)"> Speech Waiting for ESTER: the road ahead for interest rate benchmark reform Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ECB’s Money Market Contact Group meeting, Frankfurt am Main, 25 September 2018 Benchmark interest rates play an integral role in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Their widespread use across a range of financial market instruments, including deposits, fixed income and credit market products, as well as derivatives, permits standardisation and generates liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.3,0)">There is currently an estimated €22 trillion of EONIA-linked derivatives contracts outstanding and €109 trillion linked to EURIBOR.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A further €1.6 trillion of debt securities are linked to EURIBOR.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Benchmark rates are also important for the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.34,0)">In normal times, the ECB implements policy by steering very short-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">We evaluate the success of those operations by monitoring the evolution of a number of short-term interest rates, including various deposit, repo and swap interest rates in markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">But benchmark interest rates clearly carry a large weight in our operational assessments, given their interconnectedness with the rest of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.53,0)">What ultimately matters for monetary policy, however, is the constellation of interest rates faced by households and businesses when making their decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">While monetary policy can indirectly influence their financing conditions by affecting long-term interest rates, benchmark interest rates currently form the basis for a substantial share of retail borrowing in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In the euro area as a whole, they account for nearly a fifth of all new mortgages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.58,0)">EURIBOR is the reference rate generally used in these contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.29,0)">Similarly, around four-fifths of lending to non-financial corporations is based on variable rates, and is principally priced off EURIBOR.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.67,0)">The need for new benchmarks As you will be aware, the current benchmarks have encountered difficulties from two main sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.59,0)">The first is the scandal surrounding fixing during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.34,0)">Given the potential for litigation and compliance risks, banks have become reluctant to remain on panels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.88,0)">A more concentrated panel in terms of membership threatens the representativeness of the benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.13,0)">The second problem encountered by current benchmarks is the significant drop in underlying transaction volumes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In part, this reflects the side effects of the unconventional policy measures that we took to maintain price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.7,0)">As you can see on my next slide, declining transaction volumes in EONIA over the past three years coincide with the start of our large-scale asset purchases and the associated mounting excess liquidity in the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.37,0)">I will come back to this in a minute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.37,0)">These two factors together have lowered the ability of EONIA to accurately reflect banks’ borrowing costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.53,0)">On my next slide you can see how exposed EONIA has become to sudden fluctuations in this environment: in November last year we observed that, amid thin liquidity conditions, comparatively small changes in transaction amounts can cause pronounced volatility in the level of EONIA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">At a global level, this has resulted in the adoption in 2013 of IOSCO’s Principles for Financial Benchmarks, which have been endorsed by the Financial Stability Board  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The FSB coordinates international work to review and reform benchmarks and has encouraged public authorities and the private sector to identify robust overnight risk-free rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In the EU, these efforts have resulted in the adoption of the EU Benchmarks Regulation, which lays down requirements to ensure accuracy and integrity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">The Regulation requires benchmarks to be reliable and robust, and underpinned by observable transactions in an active market determined by competitive supply and demand forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.3,0)">EONIA and EURIBOR in their current form do not comply with these requirements, and may therefore be prohibited for use, at least in new contracts, from January 2020, unless reformed in the case of EURIBOR.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.5,0)">It is also uncertain whether their use in legacy contracts will be permissible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The volume of such legacy contracts with maturities beyond 2019 is substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.37,0)">A quarter of outstanding interest rate derivatives using EONIA and more than half using EURIBOR have maturities in 2020 or later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">80% of floating-rate debt securities using EURIBOR – worth almost €1.5 trillion – also extend beyond 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And as mentioned above, a substantial share of mortgages are referenced to EURIBOR.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.05,0)">Inadequate preparation by the private sector could result in market dislocation once current benchmarks become obsolete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Progress in creating a new euro area benchmark New benchmarks are therefore needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In September 2017, the ECB, the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority  , the European Securities and Markets Authority and the European Commission launched a new private sector working group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The group was tasked with the identification and adoption of risk-free rates to serve as a basis for an alternative to the current benchmarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The progress made in a very short period of time has been impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The working group developed key criteria, consistent with the IOSCO principles for financial benchmarks and the requirements of the EU Benchmarks Regulation, to shortlist potential candidates for an alternative euro risk-free rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The main criteria included the need for broad-based and reliable market data, an easily understandable concept that the index seeks to measure, and a trustworthy administrator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The working group shortlisted three candidates:   the euro short-term rate, ESTER, to be produced by the ECB, reflecting euro area banks’ borrowing costs in the wholesale unsecured overnight market;   GC Pooling Deferred, a one-day secured, centrally cleared, general collateral repo rate produced by STOXX; and   the RepoFunds Rate, a one-day repo rate secured by general and specific collateral and centrally cleared, produced by NEX Data Services Limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Only two weeks ago, on 13 September, the working group recommended ESTER as the euro risk-free rate to replace EONIA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">A public consultation was launched ahead of the vote, the outcome of which provided valuable input for decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">88% of responses viewed ESTER as the most appropriate future euro risk-free rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Overall, the ECB welcomes the recommendation of the working group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">ESTER is a reliable and robust rate and it reflects financing conditions in money markets better than secured rates, which could be influenced by regulatory and collateral factors unrelated to bank borrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">While ESTER represents an alternative benchmark for the short-term segment of the money market, progress towards the development of alternatives for longer tenors is yet to be seen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Although longer-tenor instruments are not turned over as frequently as overnight ones, they are economically relevant as they represent a significant share of outstanding amounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">You can see this on my next slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The T/N and S/N as well as the 9M and 12M maturities were aggregated for confidentiality reasons For EURIBOR, work is currently ongoing under the auspices of the European Money Markets Institute   which will hopefully result in a new, compliant benchmark, based on a hybrid methodology using actual transactions whenever available, and relying on other related market prices when required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In other words, current proposed solutions are likely to continue to require expert judgement in order to sustain daily benchmark publications on longer tenors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.16,0)">I draw two implications from this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.52,0)">First, under this approach the ECB would not be well placed to produce term rates  , as the central bank may not have the same overview of the prevailing market conditions and funding costs as banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.95,0)">Moreover, expert judgement provided by the central bank may create, or be perceived as creating, a conflict of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">And second, even if a satisfactory solution can be found by the industry, there is a need for market participants to reflect on whether a solution based on EURIBOR is sustainable also in the long run, in particular should other jurisdictions decide to abandon similar rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">For that reason it is important that the working group continues its work on the construction of credible term rates as fallback rates for EURIBOR.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">ESTER as a new benchmark This notwithstanding, the ECB looks forward to taking on its new role as administrator of ESTER.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Given the critical role of risk-free rates for market functioning and monetary policy, the ECB attaches high importance to the smooth production of ESTER, which must be guaranteed even in times of unforeseen stress or disruption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This includes building the infrastructure, defining processes and governance, and testing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Staff are working intensively to complete all these steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Developing ESTER within a tight time frame means that there is a trade-off involved: the better market participants are prepared for and understand the properties of ESTER, the faster the transition to a liquid market is likely to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I can therefore understand the arguments of those pushing for a speedy release of the new rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.24,0)">But too fast a publication might entail operational risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">A sufficient period of testing is required to make sure that the technical set-up achieves the highest degree of reliability‎ to guarantee the smooth production of ESTER.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Robust business continuity and contingency plans must be developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We have therefore communicated that we will publish ESTER by October 2019 at the latest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">In other words, we aim at releasing ESTER as early as possible, but only once we are confident that it meets our requirements regarding reliability and robustness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">We have tried to partly resolve this trade-off by providing market participants with a series called pre-ESTER, using existing MMSR data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.23,0)">Pre-ESTER is calculated using the same methods as defined for ESTER but it differs in that it is based on final data and includes all revisions in terms of cancellations, corrections and amendments submitted by reporting agents in the 10 days following the reference date used for calculating the rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.9,0)">ESTER, by contrast, will be published every morning and take into account only the data received by the submission deadline of 07:00 CET the same morning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Internal analyses have shown that over the review period since mid-March 2017 an ESTER rate calculated on the basis of data as submitted by reporting banks by 7:00 CET would not have been significantly different from a rate based on final   data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In other words, while the republication risks for mistakes larger than 2 basis points always remain possible and is catered for, the likelihood of this happening is currently assessed to be very low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">This result is reassuring from a methodology viewpoint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">But to achieve a constant high accuracy also during the actual production phase requires reporting agents to consistently deliver, on a daily basis, timely data submissions and to comply with the high data quality standards that ESTER demands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The overall quality of ESTER is therefore a collective endeavour highly depending on the commitment of reporting agents that the ECB as administrator will support and monitor on a daily basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">On my next slide you can see some of the key properties of pre-ESTER that have ultimately led the working group to choose ESTER.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Daily volumes, based on actual transactions, average €30 billion and range from €6.8 billion to €41 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">On average, around 30 banks report data each day out of a pool of 52 MMSR reporting banks, which ensures that there is sufficient underlying data to calculate a reliable rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.93,0)">MMSR data show that even on days with reduced activity on account of major holidays, including the year-end period, volumes remain sufficiently high and concentration sufficiently low to calculate an unbiased rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It will therefore not be necessary for the calculation methodology to be enriched with historical data, or to rely on other market segments or even expert judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The next slide compares ESTER’s performance with that of EONIA over the period mid-March 2017 to end-July 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.95,0)">You can see two things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">First, pre-ESTER is very stable with an average daily volatility of just 0.4 basis point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Low volatility in part reflects the way ESTER is computed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Specifically, the methodology relies on a volume-weighted mean with trimming applied at the 25% level, which ensures the best compromise between allowing the rate to sufficiently react to market factors and filtering out transactions conducted at outlying rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This ensures that the rate reflects actual market moves, rather than idiosyncratic factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The second thing you can see is that over this period, pre-ESTER was trading at a stable spread of around 9 basis points below EONIA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The spread itself is a reflection of the fact that ESTER is a borrowing rate, and not a lending rate as is the case for EONIA, and that it includes transactions with a broad range of financial corporations, not just banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.47,0)">And as a large share of these institutions do not have access to the ECB’s deposit facility, they might have different opportunity costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">In the current environment of excess liquidity and high demand for high quality liquid assets, this means they might be willing to extend credit in the money market at rates below our deposit facility rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">New benchmark measures need to be in place by 1 January 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Given the importance of these benchmarks for monetary policy, the ECB on its part is working diligently on publishing a new, robust and reliable euro short-term rate by October 2019 at the latest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Financial market participants, on their part, should redouble their efforts to ensure a smooth transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">They should examine and propose credible paths for the transition away from EONIA and towards ESTER.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Contracts should be checked for consistency with the new regulations and robust fallback rates should be specified to ensure continuity in the event of disruption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">For EURIBOR, while the private sector is currently reforming the benchmark, sufficient safeguards should be established in all contracts to mitigate the risk of potential adverse scenarios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Last but not least, market participants should spread the word to ensure that in particular smaller and less sophisticated market participants are aware of the need to prepare for the new benchmarks and to take active steps to adjust systems, processes and contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.78,0)">Time is running short.</span>
