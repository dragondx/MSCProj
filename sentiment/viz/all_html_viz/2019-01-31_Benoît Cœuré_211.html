    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)"> Fintech for the people Keynote speech by Benoît Cœuré, Chair of the CPMI and Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 14th BCBS-FSI high-level meeting for Africa on strengthening financial sector supervision and current regulatory priorities, Cape Town, 31 January 2019 Introduction  Thank you for the kind invitation to speak at this event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision   and the Financial Stability Institute   are critical partners for the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">I am very supportive of initiatives such as this high-level meeting to further our shared mission to strengthen financial stability in Africa and elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.54,0)">That said, Bill Cohen and Fernando Restoy have given me the difficult task of speaking after my friend, Governor Lesetja Kganyago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">He is always a dynamic speaker and few can match his charm and wit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Hence, it was with some trepidation that I accepted this invitation, but who would refuse an opportunity to come back to beautiful Cape Town?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">The South African Reserve Bank, as a key member of the CPMI, graciously hosted us here a couple of years ago and it was one of the most memorable occasions in my time as committee chair.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">As the global standard-setter for payment, clearing and settlement activity, the CPMI works to support financial stability by enhancing the risk management and supervision of financial market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In my remarks this morning, I would like to focus on an often overlooked objective for the committee and many of our members – enhancing financial inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Expanding access to payment services is an integral part of our work and a key regulatory priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">I will discuss fintech’s potential for achieving greater access, and the role that central banks and other authorities can play to help fulfil this potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">I will argue that, over the past decade, significant progress has been made in expanding access to payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">A number of innovative solutions – many from this continent – have helped increase access for underserved populations in Africa and around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But I will also argue that there is still much work to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.15,0)">A significant number of people still lack the means to make fast, secure and trustworthy payments and to conduct other financial activities that would integrate them into the broader formal economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.84,0)">In many cases, this burden is unfortunately often carried by those who are most in need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">We therefore need to strengthen our efforts to expand access to everyone and to effectively regulate and supervise new payments activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.71,0)">I will argue that a failure to do so may lead to highly undesirable outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.98,0)">It may push people into using unregulated and potentially unsafe “shadow payments” that include the likes of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.38,0)">These types of “shadow payments” may expose people to large financial risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">It is our duty to protect consumers and ensure that the benefits of innovation reach everyone, and not just a portion of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Financial inclusion in payments: progress made but more work ahead Five years ago, the CPMI and the World Bank established a joint Task Force on Payment Aspects of Financial Inclusion, affectionately known as PAFI, to help countries expand access to payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The 2016 PAFI report outlines actions that countries can take, including explicitly committing themselves to financial inclusion objectives, establishing sound legal and regulatory frameworks in support of financial inclusion, providing basic transaction accounts at little or no cost, having strong information and communications technology infrastructures that underpin transaction accounts, increasing financial literacy, and shifting government payments from cash to electronic payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">As we mark the PAFI report’s third anniversary, it seems like a good time to review the progress made in expanding access to payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The World Bank estimates that, in 2017, 69% of the global population, or 3.8 billion people, had an account at a financial institution or mobile money provider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This represents an increase of 7 percentage points since 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Over this period, more than half a billion people opened an account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This is certainly good news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Much of this progress is due to the rapidly increasing pace of adoption of new technologies that help reduce transaction costs for users, simplify the process of setting up an account and offer new delivery methods, among other benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">According to one study, Africa is home to more digital financial services than any other region in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The use of such services is now second nature for millions of Africans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It cleverly turned sim cards and a mobile service account into a virtual wallet for peer-to-peer and customer-to-business payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">I believe Kenya has served as an inspiration for the payments industry worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Since then we have seen the rise of new payment services in both emerging and advanced economies – some by bigtech firms, some by fintech start-ups and some by incumbent banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">These new payment schemes not only increase access but also improve competition and drive down transaction costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Before the recent fintech revolution, the cost of financial services remained astonishingly stable and surprisingly expensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In other words, improvements in technology have often not been passed on to households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">There are clear signs that this is changing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.14,0)">But   In many African countries, less than half the population has access to basic payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.07,0)">Also, without access to basic payment services, people are unlikely to have access to credit markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.25,0)">And without credit, there is less trade, less investment, less education and fewer jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The empirical evidence is overwhelming: developing and emerging market economies with deeper credit markets tend to grow faster than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.51,0)">A material number of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises in developing economies still lack access to affordable financial services and credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.15,0)">One consequence of financial exclusion from payments is that it may lead to the rise of “shadow payments”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.76,0)">If people cannot make payments through conventional systems, they may look to unregulated arrangements, such as informal savings clubs, peer-to-peer platforms or cryptocurrencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.49,0)">In doing so, they may find themselves using payment arrangements that lack operational robustness, appropriate risk management, legal certainty and consumer protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.81,0)">Thankfully, these types of arrangement do not yet serve as credible replacements for the conventional payment system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">But they may gain ground if we fail to expand payments access more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Promoting the broadest access to payment services Broader access to payment systems is therefore crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">It is the first step in the long journey towards truly universal financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Central banks and other authorities should recognise this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">They should be explicit in their commitment to expand payments access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We need to make it known to the industry and the general public alike that we, as authorities, are putting the emphasis on inclusion for everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">The CPMI is working with the World Bank to review the lessons learned from applying the PAFI framework, to develop a toolkit for countries, and to analyse fintech developments in the context of financial inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">We are also part of the Financial Inclusion Global Initiative to provide targeted technical assistance to China, Egypt and Mexico to expand electronic payments acceptance, increase the use of digital identification for financial services, and enhance payment system security, infrastructure and technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The work of the CPMI and our partners supports the new IMF-World Bank Bali Fintech Agenda launched a few months ago with a view to fostering fintech solutions that promote financial inclusion and further develop financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">To take this agenda forward, I trust the leadership of Governor Kganyago in his capacity as Chair of the IMF’s International Monetary and Financial Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Fintech solutions are not limited to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The CPMI recently conducted a survey on the potential issuance of central bank digital currencies that can enhance access to financial services for underserved populations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The results revealed that many central banks from emerging market economies are, in fact, exploring digital currencies as a way to expand financial access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">You can see this in   Survey respondents are proceeding with great caution on digital currencies – and, in my view, rightly so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.04,0)">While they are likely part of the future for central banks, digital currencies raise complex challenges related to their safety and broader impact on financial structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">We also need to analyse much more deeply how they would support financial inclusion and how central banks aim to overcome the big hurdle of providing consumers with access to basic transaction accounts or a payment device.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Recent experiments, such as Uruguay’s e-Peso, provide useful food for thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Digital currencies are, however, only one way in which central banks can foster financial inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Modernising our existing retail and wholesale payment systems is another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">In November last year, for example, the ECB launched a new market infrastructure to support fast payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Target Instant Payment Settlement   allows payment service providers to offer funds transfers to customers in real time and around the clock across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">TIPS could be a role model for developing economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">It not only has the potential to help better prepare incumbents for the challenges arising from digital giants, such as Alibaba, Apple and Google, who are integrating payment services into their ecosystems; it also has the potential to be a catalyst for financial inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Innovations like TIPS have the potential to curb the use of “shadow payments”, in particular in the area of cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.72,0)">As many of you know all too well, making cross-border payments is inefficient and expensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">According to one study, the average revenue per cross-border transaction is more than $20 across payment methods, values and corridors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">These existing barriers to fast, cheap cross-border payments are the main appeal of using unregulated cryptocurrencies, in particular in developing economies where foreign workers want to send money home, and where families want to finance education overseas, in the cheapest and fastest way possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">To date, innovation and competition in cross-border retail payments seem to have been focusing mainly on the front-end of the market, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.85,0)">the one that faces end-users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">As noted by the 2018 CPMI report on cross-border retail payments , expanding “closed-loop” proprietary systems across borders and peer-to-peer mechanisms based on distributed ledger technology may also have the potential to bring improvement to the back-end of the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Upholding the global correspondent banking network by clarifying compliance requirements, and by upgrading know-your-client   processes and utilities, can also make a difference – to which fintech can also contribute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Upgrading and interconnecting our domestic payment systems, which are convenient and have earned public trust, is certainly a complex undertaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">But it can go a long way towards helping us rise to the challenges emerging from currently unsafe crypto-assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">I believe this should be a key priority for international action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Providing safe and effective regulation and supervision A second priority that should go hand-in-hand with public efforts to study and apply new technologies is making sure that our regulation and oversight is up to the challenges of fintech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the rest of my remarks I would therefore like to address three fintech-related challenges to regulation and oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.13,0)">The first is who and what should be regulated and supervised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The second is how regulators can foster innovation and competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And the third is how to keep the system safe in the age of fintech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.66,0)">Let me start with the who and what.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.74,0)">Entity-based regulation and supervision may not be effective in the digital age.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.74,0)">Fintech is indifferent to conventional organisational forms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.65,0)">It cannot easily be covered by current regulatory conventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Some fintech firms provide services similar to those of regulated entities but are not held to the same type of risk management standards and consumer protection rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This may incentivise regulated entities to migrate towards the less-regulated parts of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.86,0)">This is what Charles Goodhart called the “boundary problem” of financial regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.62,0)">Of course, activity-based regulation is easier said than done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.33,0)">In some cases, it may be difficult to determine who should be regulated and supervised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.94,0)">Take bitcoin as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.72,0)">Authorities will find it difficult to find a legal entity responsible for bitcoin, and therefore may not be able to regulate it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">But they may be able to regulate the broader ecosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Authorities are now actively overseeing crypto-asset “gatekeepers“, such as exchanges and wallets, service providers and financial institutions, with respect to their bitcoin-related activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">A prerequisite for activity-based regulation is stronger international cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Fintech knows no borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">New technologies may make regulatory arbitrage an even more prominent concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.94,0)">Again using bitcoin as an example, banning the cryptocurrency in one jurisdiction does not stop it from being used in that jurisdiction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.32,0)">As a decentralised system, bitcoin will continue to function if a jurisdiction, or even multiple jurisdictions, curtails its use, unless we all pull in the same direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">International cooperation in the Financial Stability Board, its regional fora and in standard-setting bodies is therefore of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">My second point relates to innovation and competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.75,0)">Regulatory initiatives will affect the direction and speed of innovation in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">For example, if we intentionally or unintentionally protect incumbents, and prevent new contenders from establishing their business, then we might miss out on opportunities that could broaden financial inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">On the other hand, authorities also need to keep an eye on the stability of traditional financial intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.79,0)">New entrants in the payments arena may give rise to specific concerns, such as the winner-takes-all effect and the bundling of technical services provided by tech giants, not to mention possible challenges to privacy regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">All in all, with technological progress moving faster than ever before, authorities are faced with the difficult challenge of protecting the stability of the financial system while also allowing new businesses to grow and new services to thrive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">My third and final point relates to keeping the system safe in the age of fintech, at its core and its periphery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.84,0)">Financial market infrastructures   are the backbone of the global financial system and new technologies are challenging our ability to keep them safe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.44,0)">The core of the system is being increasingly confronted with sophisticated cyber threats.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.13,0)">Failure to effectively address cyber risks can be destabilising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.24,0)">As I’ve noted on other occasions, leaving these issues unaddressed may trigger the next financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Our cyber guidance, co-produced with IOSCO, provides details of how FMIs should enhance their cyber resilience capabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">We are also working closely with FMIs on establishing several industry taskforces to encourage greater cooperation among global FMIs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This work builds upon a similar European effort, led by the ECB, to foster greater industry coordination on cyber-related matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">And to secure the periphery, the CPMI recently published a strategy for reducing the risk of wholesale payments fraud related to endpoint security.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Mark Carney, as chair of the Global Economy Meeting at the Bank for International Settlements, and I recently invited central banks around the world to join us in the global effort to strengthen endpoint security.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Conclusion Enhancing financial inclusion – and with this I would like to conclude – needs to remain a key priority for policymakers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Over the last five years as Chair of the CPMI, I have seen laudable progress in reducing the proportion of people excluded from the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">But we can do even better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.67,0)">Millions in Africa and elsewhere do not yet have a basic transaction account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.44,0)">And if people don’t have access to basic payment services, we may find them using risky and unsafe arrangements – “shadow payments” – that do not offer sound credit and liquidity risk management, legal certainty and consumer protection rights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">We have an obligation to bring the financial system closer to the people so that everyone benefits from access to credit, savings and insurance products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">And we have an obligation to ensure that the benefits of innovation reach everyone and not just a portion of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">We need to encourage fintech to be built “for the people” – old and young, rich and poor, expert and layman alike.</span>
