    <span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)"> Understanding and overcoming low inflation Remarks by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Conference on “Understanding inflation: lessons from the past, lessons for the future?”, Frankfurt am Main, 21 and 22 September 2017 Introduction Ladies and gentleman, As this successful conference draws to an end, I wish to extend a warm thank you to all participants, for collaborating with this ECB research initiative, which has been very fruitful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In my concluding remarks, I will discuss a few issues raised during the conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Understanding inflation dynamics is especially important today due to the surprisingly low inflation levels prevailing in many countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.46,0)">Moreover, there is evidence suggesting that in some countries, the relationship between slack in the economy and inflation seems to have weakened recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In this context, a striking development is the emergence, of a “twin puzzle” after the Great Recession: first, “missing disinflation” from 2009 to 2011  , and second, “missing inflation or reflation” after 2012, particularly in Europe  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.52,0)">During the Great Recession, inflation in advanced countries did not fall as much as the usual relation between inflation and economic slack, otherwise known as the Phillips curve, would have predicted, given the severity and length of the recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.8,0)">Just as puzzling, more recent global developments point in the opposite direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.11,0)">Between 2012 and 2017, both headline and core inflation in the euro area were lower than expected  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.39,0)">Despite the ongoing recovery, headline inflation rates in several advanced economies remain well below target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">In light of these developments, the ESCB set up a network of experts to study the causes of this low inflation and to research the implications for policy  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">That network has helped us to better understand inflation dynamics in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.72,0)">In particular, we now know that low inflation in the euro area had different origins: initially, it was mainly due to external factors   while, after 2012, inflation was predominantly driven by domestic sources in an environment of weak demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Still, a great deal remains to be understood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In this respect, the research presented at this conference has shed light on many angles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Several conference papers have added to our understanding of the drivers of inflation, the nature of inflation dynamics and inflation expectations, also highlighting how new data can help us improve our knowledge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.61,0)">The dynamics of inflation after the financial crisis and the apparent disconnect with real activity led to a belief that this relationship might have broken down or at least became unstable, for headline inflation as well as for core inflation and wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.5,0)">From a policymaker’s perspective, such an apparent breakdown is serious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The presence of a structural Phillips curve relationship is part of the traditional transmission mechanism which central banks rely on to control inflation over the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.56,0)">The apparent disconnect between inflation and economic slack seems to have made interpreting and controlling inflation dynamics more difficult, with significant consequences for the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.97,0)">Namely, the inflation trade-offs would worsen: on the one hand, if inflation rises as a result of cost-push shocks unrelated to domestic slack, then it would be more costly, in terms of output loss, to bring inflation down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.9,0)">On the other hand, the flip side is that a sharp dip in inflation would require a more substantial monetary policy stimulus, which in turn could be problematic given the lower bound on nominal interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.56,0)">In sum, as I recently underlined, “a flatter slope of the Phillips curve would make controlling inflation either more costly or more difficult”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The reduced effect of economic slack is even more significant with regard to wages, a crucial factor of domestic underlying inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.25,0)">The fact that wages are not increasing more is an important puzzle in advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Higher wage increases were to be expected due to the strengthening of the economic recovery and are necessary in order to normalise inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.29,0)">In any case, changes in the Phillips curve over time make the work of the central bank more difficult, especially as they have to be understood in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Fortunately, in recent years, , the slope of the Phillips curve has been increasing somewhat in what regards headline inflation in the euro area, especially if we use a broad concept of unemployment   to measure economic slack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.22,0)">This points to one of the difficulties in using Phillips curves: the choice of an appropriate measure of slack which is a multidimensional reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.9,0)">Many explanations have been put forward in the literature to rationalise the decrease of the Phillips curve coefficient of economic slack in all advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We can group them around three categories of factors: the increased importance of external shocks, including those related to globalisation; the enhanced role of expectations in influencing wage and price decisions, anchored by central bank targets, and finally, the existence of non-linearities and time-varying behaviour of different Phillips curve coefficients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.43,0)">I will touch upon these three aspects of the Phillips curve relationships that can be at the root of the recent inflation puzzles, trying to link them with the papers and discussions at this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.0,0)">External shocks and exchange rate pass-through Let me start with external shocks or global drivers of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">There are several dimensions of the growing importance of international developments in influencing domestic inflation rates notably those related with economic and financial globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.28,0)">Some economists have gone as far as to maintain that the global economic slack became more important than the domestic one to explain inflation to the point of significantly eroding the role of monetary policy in controlling inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.41,0)">However, it is very difficult to capture, in quantitative analyses, all the effects of globalisation on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.27,0)">The channels are various and as they overlap, not all of them can be included at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">First, one can list the increased import content of economic activity as trade grows, the extension of global value chains and the augmented input-output linkages across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These factors are most visible through the impact of oil prices on energy inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Energy accounts for around 10% of the consumer goods basket used to measure the HICP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Energy inflation is very closely linked to oil prices  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.72,0)">And then there are the indirect effects of oil prices on domestic product costs, which can then work their way through the supply chain to influence headline inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The global influence is, of course, not limited to oil and energy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.63,0)">Food prices in the euro area are affected by global food prices and prices of imported consumer goods are important for domestic inflation as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.71,0)">The prices of imported goods and services directly affect headline inflation via their shares in final consumption and indirectly via their use as intermediate products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Beyond commodity prices, the role of import prices has been enhanced by the extension of global value chains and the linkages that this creates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The paper by Auer and co-authors   presented at this conference illustrates this point well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Starting from the worldwide synchronisation of producer price inflation  , they conclude that input-output linkages explain 50% of the global component of PP
