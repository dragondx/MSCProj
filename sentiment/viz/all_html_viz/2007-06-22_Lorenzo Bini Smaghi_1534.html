    <span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)"> Is the euro making countries fitter for globalisation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBDinner speech at the European University InstituteFiesole, 22 June 2007 Introduction   Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be here with you tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">I would like to thank the European University Institute for its hospitality and the organisers for having put together a very policy-relevant conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The issue that I would like to address tonight is the extent to which Economic and Monetary Union   is making its member countries fitter for globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">You have been discussing similar issues in the workshop from an academic point of view; I will now try to offer a policy-maker’s perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">I hope that at least some of my remarks will provide you with some stimulus for future research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">I will not try to define precisely the concept of globalisation, but I suggest that it can be understood as the growing interdependence of our economies via an increase in cross-border transactions of goods, labour and capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">One of the main features of globalisation has been the entrance of new players into world markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The growing integration of emerging Asia, as well as central and eastern European countries, following the collapse of the Soviet Union, has led to a sharpening of the competitive environment and to large changes in the structure of global trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">To be sure, globalisation is posing new challenges to industrial countries, challenges which require action from policy-makers but also from social partners, in order to improve the adaptability of their economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.61,0)">The issue is not only one of policies but also one of the institutional framework within which each country conducts its policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">These are important matters since globalisation is not a fad and is here to stay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.0,0)">An important question is whether the European institutional framework helps or hinders countries’ efforts to adapt to the challenge of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I will try to address this question with respect to one specific aspect of the European framework, monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.47,0)">There are two different views on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">According to the first, the best way for a country to face globalisation is to be as flexible as possible, both in the functioning of its markets and in its policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">This view says that exchange rate flexibility is the best option for a country which needs to adapt to globalisation and, pushed to the extreme, would suggest staying out of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">According to an alternative view, globalisation is better dealt with by joining a large currency union such as the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I will look at the two views, knowing that to some extent EU countries, with the exception of two, don’t really have a choice: they are legally committed to joining the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">However, it is important to understand whether and how globalisation might affect their membership of the currency union and how to maximise the benefits of participation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I will start by briefly reviewing some theory regarding the main characteristics that make a country fitter for globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I will then examine the extent to which EMU satisfies these characteristics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">What makes a country fitter for globalisation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Despite the predictions from traditional neoclassical and new trade theory as to the effects of trade liberalisation, it is apparent that while some countries are reaping large benefits from globalisation, others are not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Evidence of this can be obtained by looking at changes in the distribution of income across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Over the period 1980-2000 income per capita rose in several countries, especially at the lowest end of the range of the global distribution, most notably China and India, but also in several countries at the top.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">However, most countries in the middle of the income distribution   and in the remaining countries located at the lowest end   experienced a much smaller rise in GDP per capita.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.66,0)">This supports the view that countries – but also regions within countries, as well as firms and workers – are variously affected by globalisation, and not all of them are necessarily better off in the more open global environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.79,0)">Why is it so?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Does theory help to address this issue?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Combining the new trade theory framework originating in the works of Helpman and Krugman   with the work on firm heterogeneity by Melitz   provides helpful insights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">By introducing the presence of imperfectly competitive markets, increasing returns and firm heterogeneity into the models, new trade theories predict that liberalisations of trade and of foreign direct investment   induce not only trade creation but also, and more importantly, a general reallocation of resources across firms, countries and regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The most recent literature examines four types of reallocation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">First, the self-selection reallocation effect, in which resources are reallocated from the least to the most productive firms, not only across industries but also, and more importantly, within industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Second, the market size effect, which induces a shift in resources from smaller to larger countries, firms being attracted by the associated greater market potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Third, the increased sourcing from low-cost countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Finally, the reallocation effects derived from preferential trade agreements, which favour insiders   to the detriment of outsiders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">To sum up, the theory suggests that – in general – liberalisation leads to higher welfare for the participant countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Higher welfare stems from richer product variety, higher productivity, lower average mark-ups and lower average prices, reflecting a more efficient allocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.95,0)">While this reallocation process arguably leads to higher welfare levels overall, it might create tensions in the short term between prospective gainers and losers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Given this background, what characteristics make a country more likely to be a prospective gainer from globalisation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Going back to the above-mentioned reallocation channels, four critical features contribute to making a country fitter for globalisation: The first is a high degree of accessibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Countries or regions whose markets are generally more accessible tend to be associated – ceteris paribus – with tougher competition, richer product variety and higher productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">They also tend to be better export bases and therefore attract a greater number of firms from neighbouring countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The second important feature is market size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">In a world where economies of scale are possible, larger and more integrated markets are characterised by tougher competition, lower mark-ups and lower prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Therefore firms in a large domestic market are better prepared to cope with the structural changes associated with globalisation than firms in smaller and less integrated domestic markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">The third feature is the Ricardian technological advantage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.79,0)">Technologically advanced regions are associated with higher productivity levels and tougher competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Again, this generates greater product variety, lower prices and higher welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The last   factor that can make a country fitter for globalisation is its institutional and political framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The quality and resilience of domestic institutions are key factors in success amid global competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">A country’s ability to adapt rapidly to external shocks depends on its ability to implement timely structural reforms in areas such as product and labour markets, institutions, innovation and research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This is pivotal in making a country fitter for globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Is the euro helping countries to meet the challenges of globalisation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me now go back to the central focus of what I would like to say today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Is EMU making euro area countries fitter for globalisation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.39,0)">As always in economics, there is no straightforward answer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">EMU may indeed help, in five ways that I submit to you as hypotheses to be further tested in empirical research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">First, it has increased the accessibility and centrality of the participating economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">This all the more relevant for small economies, especially at the periphery of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">By eliminating trade barriers and reducing transaction costs across euro area economies, EMU has reduced distances, making these countries more accessible, not only for trade but also for foreign direct investment  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Second, to some extent, and jointly with the Single Market Programme, EMU is creating a larger euro area market out of a collection of smaller national economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The deepening of trade and financial integration leads to greater competition, a larger scale of production for euro area firms and increased efficiency overall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In other words, thriving in the internal market is not fundamentally different from succeeding in global markets; there is no trade-off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Third, one might also argue that EU integration, by acting as a catalyst for common research and innovation programmes, improves the conditions for further technological gains in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Fourth, by creating the need for closer economic policy coordination among the participating economies, EMU has helped to increase incentives for structural reforms within countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Policy-makers and the public in general in France, Italy and Germany, to give just some examples, are increasingly seeing reforms as the only way to make their economies more competitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Finally, the institutional framework of EMU is conducive to greater macroeconomic stability, which is very important in enabling a country to cope successfully with globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We must also be aware of several potential counter-arguments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">First, by embracing the single monetary policy framework, a country joining monetary union can no longer tailor its monetary policy to national stabilisation needs and must thus have a sufficient degree of flexibility to adapt to external shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.69,0)">Second, there might be a risk that, if several aspects of economic policy are put under joint European control, there might be a loss of flexibility in the ability to implement reforms in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This might be the reason why structural policies continue to be the competence of national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Third, there is some preliminary evidence that the impact of EMU on intra-euro area trade and business cycle harmonisation across countries has been limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">This would seem to suggest that an optimistic line of thinking on the effects of EMU on euro area economies – the “endogenous optimal currency area” reasoning – has not been confirmed yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I will come back later to the available evidence on the pro-trade effect of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.54,0)">One particularly difficult issue to resolve is the role of the exchange rate in providing the necessary adjustment to external shocks, which may arguably become more important in the era of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.23,0)">For example, national production may be hit in a very asymmetric way by competition from, say, a low-cost country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.16,0)">Is it not better to let the nominal exchange rate fluctuate in order to correct relative prices, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.09,0)">stay out of a monetary union?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This reasoning might be correct in principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It presumes that the exchange rate can act as a absorber to specific shocks, but there is empirical evidence to suggest that exchange rate fluctuations are often an independent source of shocks rather than a solution to them, especially in small open economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.07,0)">It is therefore not obvious that abandoning an independent monetary policy and the possibility of country-specific nominal exchange rate fluctuations is necessarily conducive to greater flexibility and macroeconomic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These are certainly issues to be further examined in academic research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">In this context, it is important to recognise that EMU has highlighted the role of country-specific fundamentals – such as the nature of countries’ specialisations – against the background of a single exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.76,0)">Take, for example, the differences in competitiveness between German and Italian firms, stemming from a combination of cost differentials and export specialisation patterns which have created contrasting performances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Country-specific structural factors might help to explain why euro area countries reap differing benefits from the globalisation process, while, at the same time, some countries such as the United Kingdom, which do not participate in EMU, might also reap relatively large benefits from globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Empirical evidence on EMU and Globalisation To better understand the extent to which EMU is making euro area countries fitter for globalisation, let me now briefly review the available empirical evidence on this issue, most notably as regards the trade effects of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.73,0)">Let me first state that this research agenda is a difficult one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">First, because we are still at an early stage, and many of the effects are only now developing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Second because, over this period since the introduction of the euro, euro area countries have experienced major structural changes in their trade patterns, which have ultimately led to higher import penetration and increased export share for all trade partners both within and outside the EU and EMU, irrespective of their relative income levels, and for all goods and services at all stages of the production process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">One example of such changes is the rise in the import content of euro area exports, for which there is quite some evidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Some early studies have provided preliminary evidence that monetary union has had positive effects on bilateral trade flows of euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In recent years, a stream of research has tackled the so-called “Rose” effect, named after the first contributor to the literature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">According to recent surveys  , two main findings can be extracted from the research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">First, the effect of the euro on trade is positive – increasing trade by between 5% and 15% – but more limited than the initial estimates by Rose had suggested.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Second, the effect does not seem to be exclusive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Use of the euro has so far boosted imports from non-euro area countries almost as much as it has boosted imports from euro area partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.82,0)">In other words, no substantial trade diversion effect has been identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">It is interesting to compare these findings with the development of euro area trade flows vis-à-vis non-euro area countries following the introduction of the common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Between 1998 and 2006, the share of intra-euro area trade in the total   trade in goods of the euro area increased slightly as a share of both total exports   and total imports  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">This reflects a smaller increase in intra-euro area trade than in extra-euro area trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This latter has increased substantially as a percentage of GDP, almost doubling in value terms since just before the launch of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">It might also be interesting to ask ourselves why the increase in intra-euro area trade been limited as compared with extra-euro area trade, and whether the predictions from the theory are matched by empirical evidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.4,0)">Three factors might have played a role in determining the magnitude of the observed EMU effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">First, it is likely that part of the intra-euro area trade-boosting effect of EMU integration was anticipated by other EU trade-facilitating measures, namely those contained in the Single Market Programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In the run-up to the introduction of the euro, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">in the period from 1992 to 1998, there was a particularly intense burst of integration, as ECB analysis has shown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.55,0)">Since Single Market measures were introduced at different times in different countries and EU members differ widely in the pace at which they implement EU directives, it is probably hard for empirical studies to disentangle the “euro effect” from the effect of EU pro-trade directives which have overlapped with EMU in terms of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Second, the volume of intra-euro area trade already being very substantial – it more than doubled over the second half of the last century – it is understandable that the marginal increase in the last few years has been limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Third, what we have observed and estimated so far are mostly first-round effects of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Economic theory leads us to expect that more substantial effects are likely to come over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.81,0)">Another interesting issue is the timing, nature and magnitude of the effects on individual euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.42,0)">Have the effects been similar or different across countries?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The motivation for addressing such an issue is clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.69,0)">There have been significant differences in euro area countries’ economic performances in the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.31,0)">From 1995 to 2006, the three largest euro area members – Italy, Germany and France – recorded lower growth rates than the other countries, averaging 1.7% per annum against 3.7% for the remainder of euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.43,0)">This observation does not fit with my previous assertion based on theoretical models and points to a “the larger the better” hypothesis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.53,0)">What explains this apparent contradiction?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.1,0)">Does country size matter as regards fitness for globalisation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">My take on this would be that first, when comparing such different economies, one needs to be careful to control for the effects of catching up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.59,0)">GDP growth in Greece was 0.8 percentage point higher than in the euro area as a whole over the period 1995-2006, but average GDP per capita remains 40% below the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Second, under certain circumstances the presence of FDI might play in favour of smaller countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In the presence of multinationals, and due to the positive role of FDI, small countries might gain the most from liberalisation since they have the same access to the market as larger countries while sometimes offering more attractive conditions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">How smaller countries might have a comparative advantage under certain circumstances is illustrated by the Irish economic success of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">As shown in a recent report by the European Commission,   Ireland – which benefited from the launch of the Internal Market in the EU and, at a later stage, from the adoption of the euro – was able to reap large benefits from globalisation, and its economy moved from the periphery of the operations of multinational companies to the centre..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Concluding remarks Let me now turn to the main conclusions, and a caveat: Globalisation is triggering major transformations all over the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The euro area is certainly not exempt from this shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Against this background of such all-encompassing phenomena, the adoption of the euro and the deepening of EU integration seem to have helped to make euro area countries fitter for globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The euro has not only provided participating countries with a strong and international currency and a credible monetary policy but has also helped them to become better export bases and to diversify their import and exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">EMU has also made the need for cooperation and coordination of economic policy – beyond the scope of monetary policy – more compelling, helping to make the euro area a more cohesive economic area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Nevertheless, there are also signs that further adjustments need to take place, especially in some of the larger countries of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Reforms should be aimed at raising the ability of the euro area to adjust to the major changes taking place in the global environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This can be achieved by pursuing an ambitious programme of structural reforms in such fields as product market integration, education and research, labour market flexibility and infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Implementing these structural policy priorities should raise flexibility and lower the adjustment costs for euro area firms and workers facing the globalisation process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Raising competitiveness is the main condition for making globalisation a success for the citizens of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Recent developments show that the euro area is up to the challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Before concluding, let me mention a caveat to my analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What I have said so far assumes that globalisation is a process that countries take as exogenous, as if they were all small, open economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.59,0)">The reality is a bit different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Globalisation abides by rules of the game defined in international institutions, but also works through bilateral relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We know that no market can function without a proper legal and political infrastructure, and the global marketplace is no exception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">In this context, large players may have an advantage over smaller players, as the former can have a larger say in defining the rules of the game and in ensuring that these rules are implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">From this viewpoint, participation in the euro area, which has the second world currency and is second-largest economic area in the world, should bring some advantage to its members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Unfortunately this is not yet fully recognised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.32,0)">The euro area is still not organised in international fora in a way that would allow it to influence decisions and events to the extent its economic weight would suggest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">As far as exchange rates are concerned, the euro area is well organised and participates actively in G7 and G3 meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">It has recently participated in the IMF multilateral consultation process on global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">However, when it comes to other issues related to international trade and finance, the euro area countries still act individually, although at times coordinating their positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.25,0)">Clearly, the sum of their influence does not match that of a united representation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.39,0)">I will not dwell on the reasons for this situation, having written extensively on the issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">To be sure, we have a rather paradoxical situation whereby European citizens would like to “govern” the process of globalisation, in order to ensure that its more problematic developments are adequately managed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">However, to actively participate in the governance of globalisation European countries must pool their forces and give a more prominent role to a European voice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.63,0)">This is a step that some governments are not yet ready to make, as they fear losing power and legitimacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.59,0)">This may be one of the reasons why Europe is seen by its citizens as not contributing to their well-being as they would expect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Moving to a stronger European say in the global scene will require leadership that evidently is not yet present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.87,0)">But this lack of ambition cannot be assumed to last forever.</span>
