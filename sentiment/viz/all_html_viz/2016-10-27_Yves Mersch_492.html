    <span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)"> Low interest rate environment – an economic, legal and social analysis Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, University of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Hachenburg, 27 October 2016 Many true and original comments are being made everywhere in the public debate on the low interest rate environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.47,0)">Unfortunately, what is original is not always true, and what is true is not always original.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">To bring some clarity of thought to a complex debate, I will approach the subject from three directions: economic, legal and social.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.8,0)">We are in a phase of weak growth and low interest rates – not only in Europe but in many mature economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.48,0)">Without there being a final consensus, experts are providing a colourful bunch of possible explanations for the decline in growth potential over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.4,0)">Regardless of whether the causes are on the demand or supply side, there is broad agreement that the strong relative surplus of savings – some call it a savings glut  – has resulted in a worldwide fall in long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.69,0)">Impact of low interest rates on the economy The low interest rate environment is having an impact on our lives in many different ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let us start with what you as central bankers of the future will certainly be most interested in: the economic challenges for the European Central Bank  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.46,0)">Low investment and an increased tendency to save have resulted in a fall in the equilibrium interest rate – the price at which savings and investment are in equilibrium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This is important because this interest rate plays an important role in the orientation of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But more about that later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.03,0)">Perhaps the greatest risk in such an environment is that individual developments can reinforce one other: the expectation of lower growth in the future can lead to lower investment and excessive saving today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.49,0)">As I have said before, it is important to avoid a Ricardian angst effect, meaning that persistently low interest rates result in savers developing a higher tendency to save in order to accumulate the same wealth as they would have at higher interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The fact that the gross savings ratio has been rising again recently in many euro area countries – standing currently at 17.5% in Germany, 14.4% in France – demands our attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.43,0)">The International Monetary Fund has put forward similar arguments, warning recently of a “low growth trap”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.41,0)">Such a development would lead to even lower interest rates, as ever more savings would compete for ever fewer investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.91,0)">Greater risks of deflation could ensue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.45,0)">A central bank cannot disregard such risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Our mandate is based on maintaining price stability, which is defined as an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">If we see this objective at risk, we must act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.36,0)">Let us remind ourselves how monetary policy traditionally works.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.7,0)">In his main work “Geldzins und Güterpreise”  , Knut Wicksell investigated the influence of monetary policy on investment and savings behaviour, as well as on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">He stated that if the key interest rate is reduced to below the natural interest rate, savings are lower and consumption is higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The natural rate is “the loan interest rate at which this reacts in an entirely neutral way to goods prices.”  As a result, aggregate demand increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This will raise the incentives for businesses to invest and they will demand more loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.41,0)">If the demand for loans is so large that it is not met by the existing savings, the gap will be filled by newly created money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Interest rate cuts thus lead to loan creation, investment and greater consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Investment will lead to higher salaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">As a result, the prices of goods will rise more rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Conversely, higher interest rates dampen demand and price increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.65,0)">In short: if the market rate is lower than the natural rate, inflation will tend to occur, and when the opposite is true, then disinflation or even deflation are likely to result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.33,0)">The problem of a lower equilibrium rate is that it limits a central bank’s leeway for supporting measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.32,0)">If then in such an environment further economic shocks occur on the demand side, the central bank has to resort rather to unconventional measures, as it can only lower the policy rate to a limited extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The package of measures taken by the ECB reflects this situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.72,0)">It consists of a mixture of conventional and unconventional measures: first of all, we have reduced the key rate to zero, and the rate on the deposit facility is even at -0.4%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">In addition, we have launched an asset purchase programme and offered long-term loans to banks at favourable conditions which reward additional loan provision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The aim of all our measures is to keep market rates below their long-term level and thus create an incentive for investment and consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Finally, we want to ensure that the inflation rate over the medium term returns to close to the 2% level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.55,0)">But as long-term interest rates are already at a very low level, market interest rates also have to be low and even negative in order to achieve an appropriate level of support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In order to assess the effectiveness of our actions, it is important to observe our monetary policy measures not in isolation but as a whole: demand for loans is increasing  and our staff estimate that inflation in the euro area will rise to 1.6% in 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In 2019 we should largely achieve our aim of below, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">In other words, our monetary policy is working.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">However, we are also aware that our measures are having side effects and are keeping this in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">In particular, we are aware of the fact that these side effects are heightened the longer we maintain our measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.36,0)">We are therefore keeping a very close eye on the effects that the low or negative interest rate environment has on banks, insurers and savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.09,0)">Indeed, banks are complaining that the profitability of their sector is being affected by the low interest rate environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.04,0)">This is particularly the case for banks whose business model depends heavily on net interest income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.52,0)">First of all, the margins derived from maturity transformation are declining because of the very flat yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.29,0)">And secondly, deposit-based refinancing becomes less profitable, mainly because it is difficult to pass on negative interest rates to private customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.98,0)">Some banks have started to charge for deposits over €100,000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Ultimately, however, it will mean that some banks will have to adapt their business models to operate profitably in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Particularly in Germany there is a need for action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And this is not primarily due to the low interest rate environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.26,0)">The German banking sector is one of the largest in the euro area, but at the same time the most inefficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The cost-income ratio of German banks stands at 73%, significantly higher than the rest of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.5,0)">And while other countries reduced the number of their banks by almost a quarter following the financial and economic crisis to reduce overcapacity, in Germany it was only 10%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.95,0)">Life insurance companies and pension funds which have promised their customers a nominal rate of return are also coming under pressure: they are finding it difficult to generate these returns in the current market environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">However, we are already seeing that the industry is adapting and focusing somewhat more on unit-linked products, and thus on the more dynamic capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.5,0)">However, it is not just banks, insurance companies and pension funds that are suffering from the low interest rates – savers in general are also affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Private savers are asking whether, in the current environment, it is still worthwhile saving at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In most cases they take the nominal interest rate of their deposits as a benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.03,0)">In so doing, what they don’t take account of is the real purchasing power of their savings, namely what is left over after deducting the inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.2,0)">If we consider for instance the real rate of return on bank deposits of private households in Germany since 1991, these generally remained at less than 1%, and sometimes they were even negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.71,0)">The real overall portfolio return shows large fluctuations over the same period as a result of different factors, and stood just above 1.5% on average between 2008 and early 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In recent years, higher valuation gains above all have supported the overall rate of return, to which our asset purchase programme has also contributed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.2,0)">Because the scope for further valuation gains in the future is estimated to be fairly limited, analysts in Germany are assuming that overall returns in the coming year could decline or even be negative, also because of higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These developments suggest that the low-interest phase may lead to a structural change in the financial system, which in turn could give rise to new risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.59,0)">Especially in the euro area countries which have been greatly affected by the financial and economic crisis, lending by some banks is still severely constrained by legacy assets resulting from crisis times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">On the search for yield and reinforced by technological progress new participants are coming to the fore in these fields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.27,0)">In particular, non-banks, which also go by the unfortunate name of shadow banks, are increasingly active in the traditional banking business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">At the same time, sound and liquid companies from the real economy are entering the intermediation market and providing their customers with services that used to be the preserve of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">While developments of this kind need not be a bad thing in principle, we should be vigilant and closely monitor the resulting risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.01,0)">For example, lower lending standards or higher debt levels could result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">We also have to bear in mind the liquidity risks and interconnectedness of the various sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Despite all these side effects, I would like to emphasise that the benefits of our monetary policy so far are prevailing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.87,0)">But this situation could change the longer these special circumstances continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.58,0)">Above all, we need to remember that reactions to interest rate cuts into negative territory do not necessarily follow a linear path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.05,0)">Moreover, the longer the measures are in place, the less effective they may become.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.5,0)">The fact that additional lending in the euro area is losing momentum and that German banks are saying that the negative deposit facility rate is constraining lending volumes warrants attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">We must be vigilant that this development does not spread to other euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">So when it comes to deciding what our future monetary policy stance should be, we have to take this into account in our cost/benefit analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.74,0)">This applies to instruments, volumes and horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Legal implications Let me now turn to the legal dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.69,0)">I will make a distinction here between private law challenges and the legal framework to which the ECB is subject.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.72,0)">In the financial sector, there are many products whose remuneration is based on a variable interest agreement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This means that the interest rates are regularly adapted to the prevailing market interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.8,0)">The legal position here is very unclear, since in Europe such agreements are subject not only to private law but also to regulatory requirements, based on the implicit assumption that interest rates are always positive in a market economy This new phenomenon of negative interest rates creates uncertainty and leaves much room for interpretation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.18,0)">This could lead to high legal costs if the need for clarification becomes a matter for the courts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The legal limits to our monetary policy are, on the other hand, very clearly regulated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The EU Treaties define the objective of our monetary policy measures: maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The ECB has a large measure of freedom in its choice of instruments to achieve this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">However, it must ensure that the instruments chosen are necessary, appropriate and proportionate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">In addition, it must be ensured that the European System of Central Banks   “  in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.34,0)">And finally, we are prohibited from conducting monetary financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.51,0)">This prohibition protects monetary policy against becoming a plaything of fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">So what may at first sight seem to be a restriction is, in reality, a strengthening of our mandate and our credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">All the measures that we have taken over the past few years fall within this legal framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The European Court of Justice and the German Constitutional Court have confirmed that this is the case, provided that the self-imposed boundaries are observed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.53,0)">We would do well not to shift these boundaries at whim, as this would call the current legal certainty into question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In the current environment, this means that we are doing and will continue to do everything within our mandate to ensure price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">But it also means that others have to play their part in putting the euro area back on a sustainable growth path over the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">And I address these remarks principally to the governments of the Member States which need to make progress on the necessary structural reforms in order to make product and labour markets more flexible, to reduce red tape and where possible to invest in education, infrastructure and productivity improvements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.72,0)">Breeding ground for populist movements This brings me to my last point: societal change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.79,0)">Like the low interest rate environment in which we as a central bank are operating, the current social dislocation is being caused by, among other things, low growth and the resulting high levels of unemployment in many economic areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The fact that the recent annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank addressed this issue earlier this month shows how important this issue has become.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The solution to these problems does not however lie in the hands of the central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As I said, we are only responsible for maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Fiscal redistribution, for example, for the purpose of a politically motivated correction of income differences has to be decided and implemented by democratically elected parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The division of tasks is clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Nevertheless, the societal changes over recent years have had an impact on us, and we observe these developments with great concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.14,0)">The fact is that many people in our society are finding globalisation difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.46,0)">They believe that it only benefits large companies, some of which pursue excessive tax optimisation and question protection rights for individuals – protection rights for those who are doing their bit for society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.09,0)">This sentiment, reinforced by the emotional reactions to the refugee crisis, has discredited the notion of open borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.89,0)">In addition, growing uncertainty about secure pension provisions, retaining the value of savings and the deteriorating economic outlook are a breeding ground for populist parties and movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">A growing number of people are ready to sacrifice economic and social freedom for what they believe to be greater security.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.74,0)">In such an environment, it will be more difficult for us, as a central bank, to explain our monetary policy decisions, particularly if some groups feel discriminated against by our decisions, such as savers in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.85,0)">We must take these feelings seriously, although the interest rate on savings reflects the state of the economy and is not primarily the result of monetary policy measures Our monetary policy measures have prevented the euro area from sliding into a new recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">In the long term our decisions help to stabilise the value of the currency and thus ensure more fairness in society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.5,0)">A Bundesbank study, for example, which considers whether and in what way monetary policy influences the distribution of income and wealth, concludes that it is highly questionable that the expansionary monetary policy measures taken in recent years have increased inequality overall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.16,0)">The current environment of low growth and the resulting low interest rates are already having significant economic, legal and social repercussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Through our monetary policy decisions in recent years we have prevented this situation from becoming deflationary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Ultimately, however, what matters in the long term is to increase potential economic growth, something which is critical for the prosperity of future generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.12,0)">But monetary policy cannot do this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This requires others to act: those who have the power to decide on labour market reforms, investment incentives and taxation policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">In order to push forward a lasting recovery and raise potential economic growth, structural reforms are indispensable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">The longer we remain in this low interest rate environment, the stronger the side effects of our measures will be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">So it has to be our shared goal to leave behind this special situation as soon as possible in order to minimise potential damage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.44,0)">Bernanke, “The Global Saving
