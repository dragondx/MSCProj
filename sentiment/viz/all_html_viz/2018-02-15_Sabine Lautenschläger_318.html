    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.07,0)"> A stable financial system – more than the sum of its parts Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Dutch Banking Day, Amsterdam, 15 February 2018 Logic can be a tricky thing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Apply it in the right way, and you always arrive at a consistent conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.68,0)">But apply it in the wrong way, and it can lead you astray.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.78,0)">And that happens all too easily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.98,0)">There are indeed many wrong ways in which we can apply logic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.68,0)">One of them is known as the fallacy of composition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.07,0)">It refers to the idea that the whole always equals the sum of its parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.14,0)">Well, that idea is wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.34,0)">As we all know, the whole can be more than the sum of its parts – or less.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Consider this statement: if each bank is safe and sound, the banking system must be safe and sound as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.63,0)">By now, we have learnt the hard way that this might indeed be a fallacy of composition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me give you just one example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.21,0)">Imagine that a certain asset suddenly becomes more risky.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Each bank that holds this asset might react prudently by selling it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.75,0)">However, if many banks react that way, they will drive down the price of the asset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.67,0)">This will amplify the initial shock, might affect other assets, and a full-blown crisis might result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.94,0)">Each bank has behaved prudently, but their collective behaviour has led to a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.98,0)">The business of banking is ripe with externalities, with potential herding and with contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.33,0)">These factors may not be visible when looking at individual banks, but they can threaten the stability of the entire system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is one of the core insights from the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Countering the cycle and boosting resilience Indeed, the financial crisis showed us that we had to do more than just look at each part of the system, at each bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.11,0)">The system as a whole had to be taken into account as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The microprudential approach must be complemented by a macroprudential approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And thus, a new policy area was born out of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Age-wise, macroprudential policy could be the grandchild of policy areas such as banking supervision and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It still has to grow up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Theories need to be elaborated, empirical evidence gathered, and practical experience gained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">A long childhood lies ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">But at the same time, much has already been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Over the past few years, we have set up a macroprudential framework for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We have defined objectives, developed tools and set out how different policy areas interact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let us have a closer look at how macroprudential policy works in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.41,0)">A core concept of macroprudential policy is the financial cycle, that steady succession of ups and downs, of booms and busts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.0,0)">And each time the cycle turns, each time boom goes bust, everyone runs for the exit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.27,0)">Market participants sell the assets concerned, and prices tumble; investors incur losses, as do the banks which financed their investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.77,0)">This shock might even hit banks which were prudent enough not to participate in the boom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.92,0)">The financial system is so interconnected that even they cannot escape contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.47,0)">And as goes the financial system, so goes the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.0,0)">Credit dries up, growth drops off and everyone suffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.77,0)">This story is a bit simple, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Still, it allows us to define two goals of macroprudential policy: First, make the financial system as a whole more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Second, dampen the cycle of booms and busts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In very general terms, this is what macroprudential policy aims to do in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The tools of macroprudential policy reflect these objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Some of them focus on increasing the resilience of market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.82,0)">Take, for example, the countercyclical buffer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">It requires banks to set aside more capital in upturns to make them more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Once the downturn sets in, banks can draw on the buffer, which helps them absorb losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.05,0)">Furthermore, having to set aside more capital in an upturn makes it more costly for banks to grant loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This might, as a positive side effect, dampen excessive credit growth and hence the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Likewise, reducing capital requirements in a downturn may help to spur lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Other tools focus on the general resilience of the financial system, going beyond the financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Various capital buffers have been designed for that purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There is, for instance, the systemic risk buffer, which can be applied to all banks or to specific groups of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">It aims to make banks more resilient to structural risks that affect the entire system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And then there are buffers for globally systemic banks, the G-SII buffers, and for locally systemic banks, the O-SII buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">By making systemic banks more resilient, these buffers address potential sources of contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.78,0)">At the same time, the buffers put a price on the impact systemic banks would have on the financial system and the economy should they fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This helps to internalise this impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.76,0)">Micro or macro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Separating the tools Ladies and gentlemen, at the beginning of my speech, I said that macroprudential policy is a relatively new policy area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">However, the relevant tools look and feel familiar to banking supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.0,0)">They mostly apply to banks, and often focus on capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.74,0)">Thus, the distinction between micro and macro is less clear than it should be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.51,0)">This ambiguity might cause conflicts of interest, and this leads us to the question of how to deal with them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The answer is simple: we have to clearly separate the tools of macro- and microprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To channel the spirit of the famous Dutch economist Jan Tinbergen: each risk needs its own tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let’s start with what is known as Pillar 2 in the context of the Basel framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Under Pillar 2, supervisors can apply a range of measures to individual banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The goal is microprudential: address bank-specific risks and bank-specific resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Now, under current European rules, Pillar 2 measures could also be used to achieve macroprudential goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.3,0)">And this could lead to a conflict of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.74,0)">Imagine that there is a downturn in the financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">From the viewpoint of each bank, credit risks increase and microprudential supervisors may want to increase Pillar 2 capital demands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Looking at the same trend, macroprudential supervisors might want to support credit growth and counter the cycle over a longer time horizon and from a systemic point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Thus, they may want to decrease Pillar 2 capital demands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Who should prevail?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And how should Pillar 2 be calculated when two different approaches are used by two different stakeholders?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">To avoid such tricky questions, Pillar 2 should be defined as a micro tool only – the current review of the Capital Requirements Directive offers the chance to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This would help to focus on the initial idea of Pillar 2: determining a bank’s individual level of capital based on the bank’s specific risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.71,0)">But looking at the macroprudential framework, is it enough just to define Pillar 2 as a purely microprudential tool, or is the macroprudential toolbox lacking in efficient tools?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.27,0)">And indeed, the toolbox defined by the EU legal framework may be too small to address all types of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The available tools address only those who grant loans – the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.98,0)">They neglect those who take out loans – households, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.59,0)">Take, for example, the real estate sector, which often plays a big role in the ups and downs of the financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">When house prices are on the rise, the potential gains from buying a house might be high enough to dwarf any increase in the cost of credit triggered by the countercyclical buffer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Here, borrower-based tools would dampen the boom more effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.93,0)">I am thinking, for instance, of loan-to-value ratios, LTVs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In some countries in Europe LTVs and other borrower-based measures are already part of the macroprudential toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Harmonising these tools at European level might be a good next step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.25,0)">At the same time, we should acknowledge that there is a drawback to tools which only focus on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.32,0)">The crisis has shown that the financial sector reaches far beyond banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.61,0)">And when we only tighten rules for banks, certain activities might be shifted to other, less strictly regulated parts of the financial system, namely the non-bank sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.02,0)">Consequently, risks build up outside the scope of banking regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.88,0)">Eventually, these risks might spill over into the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.09,0)">So banks might be protected from the first wave of a crisis, but would be hit by the second wave.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.32,0)">Ignoring this part of the financial system would leave the door wide open to risks and crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Thus, there is a need for tools that address non-banks and their business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.06,0)">One of these tools concerns margins and haircuts for securities financing transactions and derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.48,0)">As they stand, these margins and haircuts are pro-cyclical: they go down in a boom, and rise in a bust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Thus, there might be a case for having tools that would make margins and haircuts vary in a more countercyclical manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">To sum up, we need to clearly separate micro- and macro tools, and we need to expand the macro toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But there is more: we also need to clearly separate macro tools from each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is particularly relevant in respect of various structural buffers: the O-SII, the G-SII and the systemic risk buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Each of these buffers is meant to address a specific structural risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In practice, however, they are often used to achieve the same goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In this context, the fact that currently all three buffers are treated in combination might play a role: only the highest of them applies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Given that the buffers for systemically important institutions and the systemic risk buffer are supposed to address different risks, they should rather be set up separately and then added up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The institutional backdrop to macroprudential policy Ladies and gentlemen, so far, I have discussed the tools of macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">What I have not discussed are those who apply the tools and how they do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And this brings me to the institutional backdrop to macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.97,0)">As you can imagine, in Europe this is a complex issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Macroprudential powers were assigned to the ECB when European banking supervision came into being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.56,0)">This sounds straightforward, but it is not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.25,0)">First of all, the ECB does not have exclusive powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It shares them with the national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">And this makes sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.51,0)">After all, there is a national angle to systemic risk: financial cycles and structures vary across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So sharing powers makes sense but, at the same time, it makes things a bit trickier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">How does this work?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Well, in fact, it is the national authorities that take macroprudential measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.18,0)">The ECB then has the power to tighten – or “top up” – those measures that are covered by EU law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">This approach seeks to achieve two goals: first, it helps to counter any inaction bias on the part of national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">And second, it helps to take into account any cross-border effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.9,0)">And it’s not just the ECB and the national authorities that are involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The European Systemic Risk Board, or ESRB for short, and, in certain cases, the European Banking Authority also have a role in assessing the adequacy and implementation of certain macroprudential measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">All in all, a number of different EU institutions may be involved in macroprudential policy, depending on the measure used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.92,0)">The process of activating macroprudential tools is a long and complex one, and it does not promote the proactive and timely use of those tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In addition, each tool comes with a different activation mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">So I am convinced that these activation procedures need to be simplified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">And the notification and information procedures need to be harmonised and streamlined too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This could be done, for instance, by establishing the ESRB as the central information hub for all notifications regarding macroprudential measures in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This would reduce the overall notification burden on national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Furthermore, one might think that the authorities were free to choose the tool that they deem best suited to address the risk at hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.64,0)">Well, not quite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.75,0)">With regard to certain macroprudential tools, a rigid sequence has to be followed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.13,0)">You can’t implement certain tools without first having considered using other tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">More specifically, if you want to apply tools such as macroprudential liquidity requirements or risk weights to target asset bubbles, you first have to consider tools such as Pillar 2 requirements or various capital buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.92,0)">This sequence is known as the “pecking order” of tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">But an effective and efficient macroprudential framework should permit the flexible use of all available tools laid down in EU law to prevent systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Instruments should be chosen on the basis of their effectiveness, not as a result of mandatory sequencing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The conclusion therefore is that the pecking order should be removed and the activation mechanisms should be harmonised and streamlined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Now, as I said before, macroprudential policy is a relatively new field in terms of both theory and practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">So, two things will happen over time: the theory will advance, and we will gain practical experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Against this backdrop, the European macroprudential framework should be reviewed on a regular basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">This would help to make it more effective and more efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.36,0)">The current situation But the framework is just a means to an end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">And that end is to ensure a stable financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">So, where do we stand on this front?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.43,0)">Are there any risks to financial stability in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.9,0)">We at the ECB currently see four major risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.9,0)">The first risk is a sudden reversal of risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.63,0)">Recent events have shown that markets can be subject to corrections even when the macroeconomic environment continues to be supportive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">So far, the high volatility in the equity market has not spilled over into other markets, which is certainly good news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">That said, some market segments need to be closely monitored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Residential real estate is one such segment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Prices are broadly in line with the average valuations recorded over recent decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">However, in some large cities, real estate prices have increased more rapidly than household income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.53,0)">In addition, prices for prime commercial properties rose strongly in 2017, and the fundamentals suggest that valuations are a bit stretched here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.9,0)">Euro area corporate bond spreads for some lower-rated issuers also look increasingly tight [compared with fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.59,0)">The second risk lies in the low profitability of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.55,0)">As only profitable banks can reliably serve the economy, weak banks are indeed a concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.9,0)">The third risk is that markets might again doubt the ability of public and private borrowers to service their debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.22,0)">And finally, there are liquidity risks in the non-bank sector which might spill over into the entire financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.11,0)">So, there are risks, but, from the ECB’s point of view, they are not too pronounced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In addition, the euro area economy is recovering, and this will help to alleviate some financial stability concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">That said, the situation differs from country to country, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And as this is Dutch Banking Day, let’s turn our attention to the Netherlands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There are two things in this country that the ECB is watching closely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.89,0)">The first is the real estate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Since 2013, prices for residential real estate have been rising strongly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">This applies mostly to large cities, where we now see tentative signs of overvaluation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Prices increased faster than household income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.06,0)">But mortgage lending is still growing more slowly than house prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This seems to be largely due to the fact that many borrowers are repaying existing loans; since 2013, mortgage repayments have totalled around €60 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">This has been driven by low interest rates and a gift tax exemption for home purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.95,0)">But even when we take this into account, mortgage lending is still growing more slowly than house prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">So other factors are still in play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.92,0)">These include demography and the limited home equity of many households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.79,0)">But it’s not just residential real estate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">There is also commercial real estate, and that market is quite large relative to the size of the Dutch economy, mainly because real estate investment funds play a big role in the Netherlands – more so than in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">And prices for prime commercial real estate are rising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">On average, they are still below peak levels, but, again, we see tentative signs of overvaluation – particularly in large cities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">At the same time, loans have begun to grow faster, and lending standards have started to ease – but they are still tight compared with the pre-crisis period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Against this backdrop, both residential and commercial real estate markets need to be closely monitored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And the two markets need to be seen in combination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">After all, they are closely linked, and risks might spill over from one to the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We also keep a close eye on household debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Over the past few years, households have reduced their debt, but the level is still high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">At 106% of GDP, the debt burden of Dutch households is among the highest in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The same is true of the debt-to-income ratio, which stands at more than 200%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.97,0)">Moreover, as house prices are rising and more loans are being granted, the reduction of debt might come to an end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Against this backdrop, there might be a need for more active macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">And by this I mean a tightening of existing borrower-based measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.51,0)">With that in mind, the Dutch Financial Stability Committee and De Nederlandsche Bank have recommended that maximum loan-to-value, or LTV, ratios be further reduced to 90% over the next ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In my view, this is called for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">After all, LTV ratios in the Netherlands are higher than in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.16,0)">Combined with the high levels of household debt, this poses a risk to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.65,0)">In addition, some have been calling for the tax deductions applicable to interest on mortgage loans to be brought down more quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Here too, the Netherlands stands out, with higher levels of tax relief for mortgage loans than in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.02,0)">This kind of tax policy has proven to be pro-cyclical and has made the household sector more vulnerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">It would thus be sensible to speed up the reduction of tax relief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, Macroprudential policy is a relatively new thing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.46,0)">And what is new is almost never perfect; that is also true of macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.24,0)">It still has to mature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">We still need to refine the theory and translate it into tools that are fit for purpose, policies that work and an institutional architecture that is both lean and stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">All this requires further work and regular reviews of the status quo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.42,0)">Let us now return to the fallacy of composition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.04,0)">Each of you is made up of billions of cells.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.64,0)">Each of these cells is unconscious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.87,0)">Therefore, you must be unconscious as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.04,0)">But unless you fell asleep during my speech, you are very much conscious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.64,0)">I admit that this is a bit more philosophical than macroprudential policy, but the basic idea remains the same: the whole is more than the sum of its parts.</span>
