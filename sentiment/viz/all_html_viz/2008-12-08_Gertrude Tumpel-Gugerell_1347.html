    <h3> Speaker: Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)"> Challenges for the Euro at ten Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the conference ‘The Euro at ten: Governing the Eurozone in a globalised world economy’, Berlin, 8 December 2008 Dear Ladies and Gentlemen,   It is for me a great honour, and a pleasure, to have been invited here today to speak about the current state of the euro area, and the challenges it faces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In little more than three weeks, we will celebrate the tenth anniversary of the creation of the Euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The decision to establish European Monetary Union was - as you know - not uncontroversial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.33,0)">During the years leading up to EMU, indeed, several commentators offered gloomy projections on the viability of the common currency, with the range of predictions going from the swift break-up of the monetary union in the face of the first breeze, to the possibility that EMU might even lead to conflicts among member states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.07,0)">The experience of the last ten years - and especially the dramatic events of the last several months - have clearly shown the full extent to which such predictions were misguided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">First, since January 1999 the Euro has guaranteed to hundreds of millions of people the same extent of price stability which had traditionally been associated with the strongest among its constituent currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Second, the common currency has effectively protected euro area countries from both the inflationary impulses originating on world food and energy markets, and, since August 2007, the worst financial storm since the end of the 1920s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">The success of the Euro along this second dimension is testified by the simplest, and most telling indicator of all: as widely reported in the financial press, in several European countries which had not previously contemplated joining EMU, the financial crisis has led to significant shifts in public opinion in favor of Euro adoption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">It is during tough economic times such as those we are currently going through that both the benefits of belonging to a strong and stable currency area, and the dangers of ‘going it alone’ in an economic environment which is prone to sudden and violent swings, become fully apparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.44,0)">The Euro is only ten years old, but with the current crisis it is truly coming of age.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Today I will discuss the main accomplishments of European Monetary Union, and I will then elaborate on the challenges faced by the euro area, both within the current conjuncture, and from a longer-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Key accomplishments of European Monetary Union - SLIDE 1 - Figure 1 provides a clear illustration of a key accomplishment of EMU showing aggregate euro area HICP inflation since the collapse of Bretton Woods in August 1971.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It also shows individual inflation rates for the 15 countries which, as of today, belong to the monetary union; and the evolution of the cross-sectional standard deviation of inflation rates among these countries   as a simple measure of heterogeneity of their inflationary experiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">As apparent from the chart, after showing some signs of instability during the years leading up to the collapse of Bretton Woods, inflation increased dramatically after 1971, reaching, at the euro area-wide level, a peak of 13.6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 1974.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Moreover, cross-sectional dispersion of inflation rates reached a peak in excess of 9 per cent in the second half of the 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Starting from the first half of the 1980s, the disinflation process was characterized by a decrease in both individual countries' inflation rates, and the extent of their cross-sectional dispersion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Under EMU, euro area inflation has been equal, on average, to slightly more than 2 per cent, and has been, by historical standards, remarkably stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This inflation stabilisation under EMU has been accompanied by two further key developments: first, the disappearance of inflation persistence, defined as the tendency for inflation to deviate from the central bank’s price stability objective following a shock, rather than quickly reverting to it; and second, the stabilisation of inflation expectations, with the disappearance of an impact of actual inflation outcomes on agents’ expectations, which is a clear indication of the credibility of our price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I briefly elaborate on both issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.75,0)">Recent ECB research   has shown that, after January 1999, inflation persistence has disappeared both at the aggregate, euro area-wide level, and within its three largest countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.96,0)">Further, similar changes have affected inflation dynamics in several inflation-targeting countries and in Switzerland under the ‘new monetary policy concept’, whereas they have been largely absent in the United States and Japan, two countries characterised by a committment to price stability but lacking a clearly-defined nominal anchor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">As a result, in the euro area, Switzerland, and inflation-targeting countries, inflation dynamics is - as of today - essentially purely forward-looking, whereas in countries such as the United States and Japan it still retains a significant backward-looking component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.04,0)">What explains these findings?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The simplest and most logical explanation is that credible and clearly defined nominal anchors, by providing a ‘focal point’ for agents’ inflation expectations, have rescinded the link between such expectations and past inflation outcomes, which was instead inevitable during historical periods in which such anchors either were absent or were not regarded as credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This conjecture is indeed compatible with the stylised fact previously mentioned: the stabilisation of inflation expectations under EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.93,0)">Several recent studies   suggest that the introduction of explicit numerical targets for inflation has anchored inflation expectations, that means making them essentially unresponsive to actual macroeconomic developments - in particular, to past inflation outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Beechey, Johannsen, and Levin  , for example, show that long-run inflation expectations are more firmly anchored in the euro area than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.86,0)">They show that macroeconomic news have significant effects on U.S. forward inflation compensation - even at long horizons - whereas they only influence euro area inflation compensation at short horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">- SLIDE 2 - Low and stable inflation, and the firm anchoring of inflation expectations, have automatically led to another fundamental achievement of European Monetary Union: historically low interest rates, with all the accompanying benefits for both consumers and firms, in terms of lower borrowing costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Overall, European Monetary Union has been associated with a remarkable stabilisation of the nominal side of the economy, with low and stable inflation, well-anchored inflation expectations, and historically low and stable nominal interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.43,0)">A question that naturally arises is: ‘Did the stabilisation of the nominal side of the economy come at the expense of developments on the real side?’ As I will now discuss, empirical evidence clearly rejects such a notion along several dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.33,0)">- SLIDE 3 - Figure 3 shows a scatterplot of the standard deviations of annual CPI inflation and real GDP growth for the euro area, the United States, and 47 other countries since the beginning of European Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As the figure makes clear, the performance of the euro area has been remarkable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.36,0)">First, the standard deviation of euro area inflation, equal to 0.5 per cent, has been the lowest of the sample, with only Switzerland and Japan close, but slightly higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.8,0)">Second, the volatility of output growth, at 1.1 per cent, has been the second lowest of the sample after the United Kingdom, which has however exhibited a markedly higher volatility of inflation, equal to 0.9 per cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Third, the comparison with the United States—which, being a monetary Union of roughly similar economic size, provides the most natural benchmark - is uniformly positive, with the U.S. volatilities of inflation and output growth equal to 0.9 and 1.2, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The evidence reported in Figure 3 therefore suggests that the stabilisation of the nominal side of the euro area economy has not been achieved at the expense of the real side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Rather, the opposite appears to be true, with both the real and the nominal side exhibiting an excellent performance from an international perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Indeed, macroeconomic stabilisation has been accompanied by a remarkable performance in terms of job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.04,0)">First, from January 1999 until the end of 2007, the number of people employed in the euro area has increased by 15.7 million, compared with an increase by only about 5 million during the previous nine years; second, under EMU the unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level since the early 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The improvement in euro area labour market’s performance reflects corporate restructuring, wage moderation in most countries, and—crucially—the progress made on structural reforms associated with the Lisbon process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">As I will come to in a moment, a lot of progress in this dimension is – of course - still possible and needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">A further benefit of the introduction of the Euro has been the strengthening of trade and financial linkages across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">First, the sum of intra-euro area exports and imports increased from around 31% of GDP in 1998 to about 40% in 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Second, the Euro has been fostering a gradual portfolio reallocation away from holdings of domestic financial instruments, and towards holdings of financial instruments issued elsewhere within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Euro area cross-border holdings of long-term debt securities, for example, have markedly increased from about 10% of the overall stock at the end of the 1990s to nearly 60% in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Notably, euro area residents have also almost doubled the amount of cross-border holdings of equity issued within the area, from 15% in 1997 to 29% in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Well-integrated euro area financial markets, and well-diversified asset portfolios, decrease the extent to which the saving and spending decisions of firms and households depend on economic and financial developments in a specific country, region or sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As a consequence, credit and risk-sharing channels are increasingly contributing to attenuate the impact of shocks within a specific euro area country or sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Summing up, nearly ten years after the start of European Monetary Union, the common currency has to be regarded as an unqualified success, guaranteeing macroeconomic stability to hundreds of millions of European citizens, and shielding them from the direst consequences of the macroeconomic shocks which—especially in recent months—have been affecting the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.21,0)">Many challenges however remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will devote the next part of my speech to long-term challenges, and I will then turn to current issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Long-term challenges The long-term success of European Monetary Union crucially depends on four key issues: first, increasing the long-term growth potential of the euro area; second, making the euro area economy more flexible and more competitive; third, pursuing sound fiscal policies; and fourth, the completion of the single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I will discuss these issues in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Although the euro area economy’s stability under EMU has been remarkable, its performance in terms of average growth rates has been less impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Since the beginning of the 1990s, euro area real GDP growth has been equal, on average, to 2.1 per cent, compared with 2.8 per cent in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Since the beginning of EMU, the annual growth rate for the euro area has averaged 2.2 per cent per year, compared with 2.7% in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.36,0)">A key reason for the euro area’s moderate performance is the comparatively low trend growth in labour productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.96,0)">Whereas in the 1980s, the average annual growth rate of labour productivity was equal to 2.3 per cent, in the 1990s it declined to 1.8 per cent, and between 1999 and 2007 it further decreased to 1.2 per cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">By contrast, over the same periods average U.S. hourly labour productivity growth accelerated from 1.2 to 1.6, and then to 2.1 per cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.74,0)">What lies at the origin of these differences in labour productivity developments in the two areas?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.91,0)">Specific policies targeted at increasing employment - in particularly for the unskilled segment of the labour market - certainly contributed to the decrease in labour productivity growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.78,0)">Labour supply developments, however, can only explain a minor fraction of the overall deceleration in labour productivity growth, with the dominant portion being instead due to a significant slowdown in total factor productivity growth  , which is generally taken as a measure of technological progress, and of improvements in the organisation and overall efficiency of all the factors of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.75,0)">Average TFP growth in the euro area, indeed, was equal to 1.6 per cent in the 1980s, and it declined to 1.1 per cent in the 1990s and to 0.7 per cent between 1999 and 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">What explains such difference between the United States and the euro area in terms of average TFP growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The consensus among economists points towards a clear edge, on the part of the United States, in exploiting advances in information and communication technology  , due largely to a favourable regulatory environment, a superior ability to redesign management and organisational systems, the relative ease of reallocating, retraining, and shedding workers, and continued investment in research and development  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.94,0)">In 2006, the fraction of R&D investment relative to GDP in the euro area was only 1.9 per cent, compared with 2.7 per cent in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This is a first dimension along which improvements ought to be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">It is also necessary to intensify cooperation between industry, universities, and public sector research institutes, in order to raise the efficiency of public R&D spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.59,0)">As for investment in human capital, in several euro area countries its rate of accumulation is still insufficient, in particular when compared with the needs of contemporary, knowledge-intensive economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The effectiveness of the accumulation of human capital should be enhanced at all stages of the education process, by improving the quality and efficiency of our schools and universities, and should be continued through lifelong training and learning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">A further step ought to be increasing competition in both labour and product markets, thus providing strongest incentives to invest and innovate, and to ultimately boost productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">More generally, it is necessary to support a more innovative and entrepreneur-friendly economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Europe needs to create an environment which is more apt at fostering new and dynamic firms willing to reap the benefits of opening markets and to pursue creative or innovative ventures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Finally, a key requirement is for firms to be able to access relatively easily the finance they need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.47,0)">From this point of view, the euro area significantly lags behind the United States, with its venture capital financing, expressed as a fraction of overall GDP, being equal to a fraction of what it is in the U.S..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Turning more specifically to the labour market, the comparative rate of growth of working-age population is one of the key factors explaining differences in real GDP growth between the euro area and the fastest growing industrial economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Over the last two decades, for example, the average contribution to real GDP growth from growth of the working-age population has been approximately 0.8 percentage point higher in the United States than in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.08,0)">Looking ahead, the euro area faces the prospect of an ageing population, so that the labour force could become an important constraint on trend growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Turning to labour utilisation, in spite of subdued growth in working-age population, over the last ten years there has been a significant increase in the total number of hours worked in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.07,0)">This stands in contrast to developments in the United States, where a small deceleration has taken place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">A significant portion of the acceleration in the euro area can be explained by an increase in labour utilisation, and in particular by improvements in both participation and employment rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Despite this progress, however, there is still room for improvements in the workings of European labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.95,0)">First, the employment rate in the euro area is still low by international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.87,0)">Second, the rate of unemployment in the euro area is still high, in particular in some individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.06,0)">In particular, whereas the employment rate for prime-age males in the euro area is comparable to that in the United States, significant disparities between the two areas remain concerning the youth, female and older segments of the labour force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.4,0)">For example, in 2007 the female employment rate was 58 per cent in the euro area, compared with 66 per cent in the United States, whereas the employment rates for older workers were 43.3 and 61.7 per cent, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.46,0)">Finally the youth employment rates in the two areas were 38 and 54.2, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In spite of significant achievements in job creation over the most recent years, both the still comparatively high unemployment rates in the euro area, and the low participation rates in some countries, point towards the need to stimulate both the supply and the demand sides of the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Concerning labour supply, further reforms in income tax and benefit systems would contribute to increase incentives to work, especially for those segments of the labour force characterised by a weaker attachment to the labour market, such as women and older workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.9,0)">Concerning labour demand, it is necessary to reduce labour market rigidities, in particular those restricting wage differentiation and wage flexibility, which negatively impact upon the hiring especially of younger and older workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.76,0)">Under this respect, in several euro area countries progress towards greater contractual flexibility has been comparatively slow, and employment protection legislation—especially for permanent contracts—remains quite rigid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Beyond increasing flexibility, another key challenge for the euro area is improving its competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In this respect, a key issue is keeping the dynamics of unit labour costs firmly under control to prevent or correct abnormal deviations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.25,0)">In situations in which such deviations appear, it is of paramount importance that social partners and national governments take swift action in order to address wage developments that go beyond productivity increases, so that unit labour costs in those economies increase less rapidly than the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The third key long-term challenge is the commitment to sound fiscal policies and, thereby, to implement the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">There are several reasons why sound fiscal policies are a crucial prerequisite for the monetary union’s long-term success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">First and foremost, they are needed in order to minimise the risk of fiscal policy spillover, both into monetary policy and, more generally, across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Further, they are needed to increase the flexibility and adaptability of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Sound fiscal policies, for example, are a necessary condition for flexibility, thus dampening business-cycle fluctuations through the workings of automatic stabilisers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The final challenge pertains to the full completion of the Single Market, which will not only increase competition and efficiency, but also improve adjustment mechanisms in the face of adverse shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Under this respect, in spite of the fact that the single market was already a goal of the founding fathers of the European Union—as set out in the Treaty of Rome—there is still significant progress to be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">According to the OECD, for example, product market regulation is still high in several euro area countries, and the extent of regulation in the euro area considered as a whole is still significantly higher than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Let me now turn to a key challenge that we are currently facing, namely how EMU deals with the current developments in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.41,0)">Current challenges The world economy is currently going through the most dramatic crisis since the 1930s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.25,0)">The factors leading up to the current turmoil were excessive growth in global credit, and historically high leverage in the financial system as well as in the non-financial sectors of some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.61,0)">Excessive credit growth and inordinately high levels of leverage, however, are not a product of nature: rather, they were the product of a specific time and of specific regulatory frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.98,0)">In fact, the developments since August 2007 were also the outcome of minimal, or ‘light touch’ regulation - or even the circumvention of regulation at all - which in the views of some went so far as to maintain that markets could essentially ‘self-regulate’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Therefore, I believe – and this will be an important challenge for the coming years - that the current episode will ultimately lead to a new intellectual consensus on the proper boundaries between governments and markets, first and foremost concerning the most appropriate regulation of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.45,0)">Working within such a system in flux, policymakers around the globe are now battling the consequences on the real economy of the strongest recessionary winds since the financial market collapse of the end of the 1920s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.76,0)">The situation is made especially complex by a combination of several different problems which - even taken in isolation, by themselves - would be sufficient to create significant challenges for policymakers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me briefly discuss the most important among them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.51,0)">First of all, there is the painful realisation, on the part of consumers in several countries, that the economic strength that they had come to regard as ‘natural’ over the last several years seems not sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">To a significant extent, such strength was largely based on borrowing: borrowing against houses whose prices has been artificially inflated by bubbles and borrowing by accumulating credit card debts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.9,0)">Today, household in several countries have found themselves burdened by staggering amounts of debts, which prevent them from consuming precisely at a time when their consumption would be most needed to cushion the economy from the winds of recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Within such an environment of retrenching consumption expenditure, having well-functioning financial markets, and a strong banking system, would be of paramount importance in order to smooth out the impact on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.09,0)">But since early August 2007 the financial sector has been engulfed by an even more serious crisis, which has required policymakers to intervene to a previously unthinkable extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The crisis has shown the benefits of belonging to a strong and stable currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.01,0)">As a consequence, the current crisis has led to a radical reassessment of the desirability of joining the Euro on the part of policymakers, financial market participants, and citizens in several countries outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The recent crisis has clearly shown the fundamental role played by central banks in crisis management, through the provision and management of liquidity in the money markets and - in some exceptional cases - by providing emergency liquidity to individual institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In this respect, the ECB’s money market operations have consistently been based on the fundamental principle of separation of the monetary policy stance from liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The former is determined in the light of the primary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The latter’s goal, on the other hand, is minimising financial stability risks, and ensuring the orderly functioning of money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The provision of unlimited liquidity to the euro area banking system on the part of the ECB, against an expanded array of eligible collateral since mid-October, should effectively eliminate concerns about liquidity risk, and should therefore further reduce pressures in the money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.18,0)">Central banks’ actions, however, can only go so far, as they cannot tackle some of the underlying causes of tensions on the money markets, first and foremost concerns about counterparty credit risk, and the continuing uncertainty on banks’ other funding sources and capital positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In this respect, the measures taken by the governments and shareholders are, therefore of paramount importance, and should address these problems over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Moreover, it is key to ensure that there is access to financing for all sectors of the economy, especially for small and medium sized enterprises, which cannot access the capital market so easily Concluding remarks I would like to conclude by recalling some important points which ought to be kept in mind in order to reinforce the strength and resilience of the euro area economy, thus contributing to preserve and consolidate the remarkable success of the Euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">First and foremost is the need to proceed along the path of structural reforms, with the firm implementation of the Lisbon strategy, as refocused and reinforced by the EU Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">This is crucial to increase the euro area’s growth potential, foster job creation, and increase the resilience of the economy in the face of shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.75,0)">A second key issue is the need to regularly monitor developments in unit labour costs across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">In particular, in those countries which have witnessed sizeable cumulative increases in unit labour costs above and beyond the euro area average, with the resulting loss in competitiveness, it is essential that all social partners fully understand the importance of cost and price moderation within the context of the Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Third, it is of crucial importance - especially within the current uncertain environment - to preserve the public’s trust in the soundness and long-term sustainability of fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">And fourth, it is important to get the regulatory response right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.48,0)">Market participants cannot go back to the business models of the 60s and 70s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">However, the regulatory and institutional framework for the financial sector as well as business models, risk taking and corporate governance should be reviewd with and open mind in the interest of long term prosperity and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Let me close with a positive note by emphasizing that it is important to remember the benefits the Euro has brought to hundreds of millions of people: low inflation and low interest rates, macroeconomic stability, and – at the current juncture – has given protection against some of the potential consequences of the worst financial storm since the end of the 1920s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Let me re-assure you that ECB will stand up to the challenges we are facing to continue achieving our main goal of maintaining price stability in the euro area as part of the European policy agenda to preserve and reinforce the success of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
