    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.2,0)"> Panel Session: Drivers of European Financial Integration - Markets or Policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Introductory Remarks by T. Padoa-Schioppa Symposium concluding two years of the ECB-CFS research network on “Capital Markets and Financial Integration in Europe”Frankfurt, 11 May 2004 A mixed assessment I am pleased to welcome you to our panel on “Drivers of European Integration – Markets or Policy”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.38,0)">The notion of financial integration is not easy to capture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What do we really mean when we say that markets are integrated?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Certainly, there are market segments where the “law of one price” can be used to determine the extent of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.2,0)">This is the case, for instance, in money markets: almost exactly since the day of the introduction of the euro in 1999, rates for overnight loans have been – except for very small differences – virtually the same throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Here, we can indeed talk of an integrated market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">However, it is not only the price that is relevant for integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">More generally, it is important for integration to be properly understood, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">that all agents with the same relevant characteristics have access to the same set of instruments, that they face a single set of rules, and that they are treated equally when accessing a market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.48,0)">Against this yardstick, my general assessment of what has been achieved in financial integration in Europe is mixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The introduction of the euro has undoubtedly fulfilled a fundamental precondition for larger, deeper and more integrated financial markets, markets that would help participants to increasingly benefit from the potential of the “single passport” for the provision of financial services across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The measures adopted under the Financial Services Action Plan   are important in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.73,0)">However, such integration is far from complete and, in particular, has not yet taken place in several market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.29,0)">One example is the wholesale activity of securities settlement, which remains highly fragmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">There are today roughly 40 national clearing and settlement institutions, of which about half are located in the Member States that have just joined the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.91,0)">This fragmentation may constitute, in turn, a material obstacle to market integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.98,0)">A market or a policy process?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.96,0)">I observe a tendency on the part of European policy-makers to look at the integration of financial markets as something that is for policy to decide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">My conviction, I must say, is that this is something that should be left to the markets themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.57,0)">Policy is not in the position to judge or even decide how far integration should go in different areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.01,0)">The boundaries of marketplaces can hardly be defined by regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Entrepreneurial decisions and business strategies taken by market players who risk their own money are the factor that should determine those boundaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It is for them to define the geographical and material scope of their practices and transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Market participants have a better insight into the market, and are more able to judge future developments and consider which opportunities they wish to grasp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This said, there is no doubt that the regulatory and legislative framework plays an essential role in determining the ability of the market to achieve integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Differences in national legislation or regulatory practices can be important obstacles for the emergence of an integrated market, according to the notion of integration that I have just used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.28,0)">Similarly, varying supervisory practices across countries may make it very costly for financial firms to operate on a multinational basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.46,0)">Such obstacles can and do affect market behaviour substantially, often allowing only a degree of integration that is clearly lower than the one markets could and would like to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Therefore, it is essential that policy creates a framework in which market participants can operate irrespective of national borders, and achieve the best outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">This framework should ensure that impediments to integration such as inefficient market infrastructure and protectionist practices are removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Ideally, it should also act as a catalyst for change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">It is possible that even after the removal of regulatory barriers, markets still fail to achieve a higher degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.75,0)">There are a variety of reasons why such an outcome could be produced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.9,0)">Financial firms may find it difficult to enter foreign markets because of linguistic differences, or differences in corporate culture, in the functioning of labour markets, or in the respective legal systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.3,0)">Here, I would like to highlight two possible reasons – lack of competition and lack of cooperation - that explain why the removal of legislative or regulatory obstacles to integration may not always lead to market integration by itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">First, it may be the case that the relevant market players have no incentives to advance integration, for instance because they enjoy a special position as monopolist in the conduct of cross-border transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">More integration would be efficient for the financial sector as a whole and for end-users, but lack of competition prevents the outcome from being achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Here, public action could improve the situation by ascertaining the exact nature of the impediments to competition and possibly by adopting legislation and executive actions designed to foster competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.74,0)">Second, integration could be impeded by insufficient harmonisation of market practices, which can only be corrected through intense coordination among market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">As this is difficult to achieve spontaneously, public authorities could provide assistance by creating fora for discussion, by suggesting standards, and generally by playing a coordinating role between the parties involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">To conclude on this point, the private sector should not face any legislative or regulatory impediments in its development towards a more integrated market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The degree of integration should be driven by business strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">However, for the market to convert to the most efficient level of integration, it is essential that policy creates a framework in which business can develop towards the optimal level of financial integration within each market segment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">The rulebook Legal and regulatory harmonisation at the EU level plays a crucial role in both “negative” integration – dismantling national barriers – and “positive” integration – such as building up a level playing-field through a common set of basic rules for cross-border business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">In this context, as you all know, the effectiveness of the procedures proposed by the Group of wise men for financial regulation and supervision chaired by Alexandre Lamfalussy will be decisive in the post-FSAP period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">It should not be taken for granted that the ambitious measures which have been adopted under the FSAP will bring about the positive integration they aim for, particularly in terms of effectively removing remaining segmentation in the areas they cover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The single passport exists in theory but not always in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The effectiveness of single passports will depend, in my view, on how efficiently the FSAP measures are translated into a consistent EU rulebook and enforced coherently across the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Let me turn to these issues one by one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">There are several aspects that I urge to keep in mind when implementing the newly proposed FSAP measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">First, it is crucial that these measures are implemented in a uniform way across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.81,0)">A non-homogeneous regulatory structure increases the regulatory burden borne by financial institutions and lowers the incentives to be active throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Second, the new regulation should be implemented in such a way that financial institutions have to cope with a lighter rather than a heavier rulebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The new regulation in the form of EU secondary legislation adopted by the so-called Level 2 committees should be integrated into, or replace as far as possible, those that are in place now at both the EU primary legislation level and at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Third, the new framework should guarantee that implementation phases are as short as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This too could be achieved by having the main regulatory work done at Level 2 instead of Level Directives should provide only a general framework, while specific provisions should be made in Level 2 regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This would increase the flexibility of the framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Finally, in my view it is essential that the Lamfalussy principles apply not only to newly issued legislation, but rather to the whole body of existing regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This should therefore be revised in light of the new framework in order to create a regulatory structure that is as uniform as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">These measures are important if we are to achieve the implementation of a common, flexible European rulebook that should as far as possible replace or harmonise existing national rulebooks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Implementation and enforcement Let me now turn to the field of supervision, that is, the implementation and enforcement of the rulebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Here, I see two objectives that should be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The first is a convergence of supervisory practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.77,0)">Today, financial institutions that operate in several countries have to bear large costs to comply with the various procedures that are required by the different national supervisory bodies from one country to the next.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">In order to ease this burden on financial institutions, a consistent application of common rules by the authorities is highly desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">To achieve such a convergence of supervisory procedures, cooperation at the EU level is indispensable, enabling transparent standards and agreed best practices to be developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.8,0)">The desired outcome would be that any financial group operating in more than one EU country would be confronted with a single set of rules and procedures across the whole area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The second objective is to enhance the level of cooperation between national supervisory agencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In particular, all bodies that are involved in the supervision of a financial group should have access to a basic set of information concerning that group and those that compete with it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Such an exchange of information between all bodies that have access to supervisory information should take place on a regular basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This exchange could contain up-to-date information on the group’s strategies, its risk profile, and an assessment of the potential of contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.81,0)">To avoid problems of confidentiality, the information transmitted should not contain sensitive confidential data, for instance those acquired during on-site examinations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">A regular pooling of selected quantitative data that are often even publicly disclosed would greatly improve both the individual and the collective action of supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The Eurosystem Finally, and before inviting the other members of the panel to speak, let me mention the interest and the contribution of the Eurosystem to financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">In effect, the central bank of the euro has provided a fundamental contribution to the integration of financial markets by the very creation of a currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This is a necessary, albeit by itself not sufficient, condition for financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.11,0)">Indeed, as I mentioned at the beginning, there are segments of the financial system that are not yet integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The Eurosystem and the ECB have a strong interest in integration because it is crucial for both the effective transmission of monetary policy and the efficient channelling of savings to investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">I believe that the ECB is in a unique position to foster European integration because of its truly European character, because of its proximity to market players, and because of its strong capacity and expertise in economic and financial analysis.</span>
