    <h3> Speaker: Eugenio Domingo Solans </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)"> The role of the Eurosystem in financial markets Eugenio Domingo Solans, Member of the Governing Council and of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Speech delivered at ACI Ireland - The Financial Markets Association Dublin, 9 October 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I am delighted to be here in Dublin today to discuss with you the tasks of central banks, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.15,0)">the job of central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Before doing so, I should like to thank ACI Ireland very much for its kind invitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.69,0)">As you know, one of the popular definitions of the job of a central banker is to remove the wine when the party is livening up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.84,0)">I wonder if this consideration has influenced the timing of my speech this evening, when dinner is about to finish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.27,0)">In any case, I can assure you that this is not my intention, at least not this evening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Although I certainly believe in the central bank's role of steering the economic "party" via interest rates, I haven't come here to speak about monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Instead, I wish to make some comments on the role of a central bank in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Having said this, I should like to stress at the outset that both functions are not independent: on the contrary, they are closely interrelated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.89,0)">In the case of the euro, the role of the central bank needs to be re-stated as the role of the Eurosystem, for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">First, it is the joint responsibility of the European Central Bank   and the 12 national central banks of the euro area, in contrast to monetary policy decisions, which are the responsibility of the ECB alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.85,0)">Second, in financial markets many competencies are decentralised; segmentation still remains an unfortunate feature of the euro area financial system in too many areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Coming back to the title of my speech, the role of the Eurosystem in financial markets, it is worth recalling that, interestingly, many central banks were founded by governments which wanted to enjoy the financial advantages that could be obtained from such banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.5,0)">Thus, their tasks were far from what the functions of modern central banks are perceived to be today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Later on, the key role played by these banks and their "political power" as the governments' bank, the control over the reserves of coins as well as their ability to provide extra cash by discounting commercial bills, made them the bankers' bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">In addition, their privileged legal status naturally resulted in a degree of centralisation of bank reserves at the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Almost inevitably, the resulting responsibility led central banks to develop their roles in relation to monetary management and to the support of and responsibility for the health of the banking system at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.19,0)">Needless to say, the core function of a central bank is monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.94,0)">But it is not the only one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">If only in order to implement and transmit interest rate decisions in an effective and smooth way, central banks should also play an active role in promoting the efficiency of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I shall first discuss the relationship between monetary policy and the financial structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Thereafter, I shall consider the relationship between the financial structure and financial stability, which essentially means discussing the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.02,0)">As we all know, the conduct of monetary policy takes place through the banking system and the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Thus, central banks are interested in knowing and influencing financial structures because they play an important role in shaping the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.44,0)">The channels through which the interest rate decisions of the central bank affect the economy constitute the monetary policy transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.87,0)">The process is rather complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.67,0)">It includes bank credit conditions, exchange rate, economic agents expectations, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.15,0)">Any change to the policy-controlled interest rate affects inter alia market interest rates and prices of financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.5,0)">These interest rate and asset price changes are then transmitted to the rest of the economy, affecting spending decisions and ultimately the inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.19,0)">In an environment of well-developed and efficient financial markets, monetary policy normally affects household spending via its impact on interest rates and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.84,0)">On the one hand, a change in the interest rate may induce households to modify their decisions related to the consumption of goods and services and residential investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.55,0)">On the other hand, changes in asset prices may affect households' wealth directly and thus their consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.89,0)">Fixed and inventory investment by firms depends on the cost of capital they are faced with and the relation between the market value of capital and its replacement cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These values are related to interest rates and prices as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The exchange rate and the expectation channels of monetary policy transmission also play a role in this complex web of economic interactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.04,0)">The magnitude and speed of the pass-through of monetary impulses depend on various features of the financial system, such as the importance and the role of banks and capital markets respectively, the maturity structure of non-financial sector financing and the prevalence of variable and fixed interest rate contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.08,0)">Other institutional characteristics such as the tax system, corporate governance, banking relationships and competition in the banking sector may also have implications for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In order to implement the best possible monetary policy for the euro area as a whole, the Eurosystem endeavoured to take a euro area-wide approach to economic and financial developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Furthermore, in many aspects of the economy, including financial structures, an understanding of national structures is essential for a thorough comprehension of the same structures at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The euro area is characterised by a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for about 60% of private sector employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Partly related to that, links between firms and banks are marked by relationship lending, in which banks and customers conclude agreements on terms of credit, implying for instance secured access to credit lines at pre-set prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.59,0)">Thus, a reduction in the availability of relationship lending could have an effect on the euro area's economy and on the workings of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Recent developments in bank structures and banking competition seem to point to a reduction in relative terms of the scale of relationship lending activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.12,0)">In turn, this could affect the euro area business cycle and the transmission of monetary policy as the liquidity provided by banks to small and medium-sized enterprises decreases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Financial structures are also important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.43,0)">Central bankers must oversee financial structures because of financial stability concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Central banks began to be involved in financial stability because of their role as the bankers' bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.46,0)">They lent to commercial banks and held their liquidity reserves in the form of deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">As a matter of prudent management of their activities, central banks needed to evaluate the financial soundness of the commercial banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Thus, central banks were naturally prompted to address financial stability concerns, irrespective of the attribution of formal supervisory tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Today, central bank activity in this area concentrates on both systemic stability and the stability of individual institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The analysis of financial stability has traditionally paid close attention to credit risks related to financial cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">These risks notwithstanding, recent changes in the financial system have brought about additional concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.03,0)">More traditional financial systems were characterised by a clear-cut separation between institutions and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.54,0)">Thus, the exposure of banks to market volatility was limited, as they largely focused on the transformation of deposits into illiquid loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Furthermore, there was also a clear separation between banks, insurance companies and brokerage companies, as well as between the products they managed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.38,0)">Most importantly of all, domestic financial systems tended to be insulated from one another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.91,0)">Financial crises taking place in these financial systems followed broadly similar patterns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.86,0)">A lending boom and consequently a significant rise in asset prices was typically followed, at the turn of the business cycle, by failures of some banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Economic and Monetary Union has introduced dramatic changes in the interplay of European financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Above all, the main effect has been enhanced competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Integration and competition are mutually reinforcing phenomena which are evolving in Europe – though for some observers at too slow a pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Further integration can only result from an effective interplay between competitive market forces, cooperative efforts among market participants and the action of public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">At the euro area level, the challenge for the public sector is to create an environment where cross-border operations are not overly costly for firms and their customers, and where cooperative solutions among market participants can be found to promote integration, which, in turn, could reinforce rather than restrict free competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The challenge for banks and other financial firms is to exploit the opportunities of the wider marketplace and hence contribute to a more efficient and coherent European financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.91,0)">As always, the downside of these opportunities is the threat which they can entail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">More intense competition requires firms operating in the same market to be more efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">While clearly promoting further competition, public authorities also have to make sure that the transition process is smooth, so that any severe episodes of financial instability will not prevent us from gaining the full benefits of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Only if integration results in a genuine increase in competition will its economic benefits be reaped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">It is of the utmost importance that the authorities ensure a sufficient level of competition and remove the remaining constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Greater competition over a wider market area will lead to a lower cost of funds and financial services, higher returns for investors and a wider array of available financial products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">At the same time, greater competition encourages European banks to become more efficient and thus, in the long term, it improves their profitability and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Certainly, competition implies better opportunities for some, serious threats to others and additional challenges for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Competition compels banks to ensure that they operate efficiently and respond to changes in the habits and preferences of their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.26,0)">Financial integration and deregulation are blurring the distinction between the traditional financial sectors: banking, securities and insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">This fact in itself increases the possibilities for competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">A prerequisite for turning these possibilities into reality is that banks can compete effectively on the same scale as other institutions in the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">What this means is that commercial banks must be able to become pan-euro area or even global institutions, in the same way as securities markets have become integrated at the level of the euro area or even globally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">From that point of view, cross-border banking cooperation and integration in their different forms   are developing relatively slowly in the euro area, although in some European Union countries, such as Belgium, Ireland, Portugal and the Nordic countries, a very significant proportion of the capital of banks is held by shareholders based in other European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">European banks have in fact expanded their presence in other European countries mainly by establishing branches or subsidiaries, as is clearly the case with some German banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Efforts should be made to identify and to remove the obstacles that could discourage further cooperation and integration of the European banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In this respect, the existence of a common set of rules is a precondition for free and fair competition, as recognised and aimed at by Community legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.14,0)">But there remain fields in which inconsistencies between national legislation hamper the full integration of the financial system and certainly – let us put it this way – do not favour the development of a European banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.88,0)">I will mention only two examples to illustrate this fact: the heterogeneity of bankruptcy laws and the absence of a Directive on takeover bids.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.96,0)">The relatively limited number of cross-border deals in Europe is not only due to a lack of legal harmonisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.4,0)">Rigidities in labour markets as well as excessive administrative rules reduce the possibilities for streamlining and reorganising banks and introducing the cost-cutting measures necessary to fully exploit the economies of scale resulting from cross-border agreements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Differences in culture should also be mentioned, although I am firmly convinced that what ties us Europeans together is larger than what separates us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.62,0)">Occasionally, the attitude of some national authorities, inclined to treat domestic mergers or acquisitions more favourably than similar cross-border operations for nationalistic reasons, explains the relatively low number of such deals in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Although financial integration provides banks with enhanced possibilities for risk management, it has at the same time increased the probability of systemic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Financial integration has increased the risk of contagion and changed its nature and scope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.61,0)">The concept of systemic risks is definitely no longer a national concept; it is a euro-area and even a worldwide concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This, precisely, is the raison d'être of Article 105.5 of the Maastricht Treaty, which reads as follows: "The European System of Central Banks   shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is crystal clear that the competent authorities for banking supervision are the national ones, in accordance with the subsidiarity principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Accordingly, the national authorities should decide the optimal organisation of supervisory tasks, taking into account their particular circumstances and national traditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In my opinion, the best model is to entrust the national central bank   with supervisory responsibilities at both the macro and micro level, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">prudential supervision related to systemic risks and threats to stability arising from macroeconomic or financial market developments and from market infrastructures, and prudential supervision related to the soundness of individual banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">I also think that NCBs should somehow be involved in the work of committees dealing with banking regulation, because there is a close synergy between central banking and supervision and regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.48,0)">After the introduction of the euro and the centralisation of monetary policy decision-making in Frankfurt, the best argument against central bank involvement in banking supervision, namely the potential for conflicts of interest between supervision and monetary policy, becomes less valid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.32,0)">Moreover, the arguments in favour of central bank involvement in prudential supervision remain or become even more prominent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To prevent systemic crises, central banks are either the only, or else the best prepared, institutions to deal with liquidity issues, the functioning of payment systems, the assessment and prevention of macroeconomic risks to financial stability, informational requirements regarding money and banking statistics, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In short, there are good reasons why NCBs should be entrusted with the national competence for banking supervision or, at least, be involved in it to a great extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Some countries have decided to create an independent single authority responsible for the supervision of all financial institutions and markets, following the example of the Financial Services Authority   set up in the United Kingdom in 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.86,0)">The main argument in favour of a single supervisory model is the blurring of boundaries between financial intermediaries that I mentioned before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Certainly, this argument calls for greater cooperation between different supervisors; nobody would be against an exchange of information or some degree of coordinated action when it is appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.11,0)">Nevertheless, to put all the supervisory activities of heterogeneous institutions under the same roof seems to be going too far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.9,0)">Not only do supervisors master specific technicalities and use different tools in their respective areas, but also the missions assigned and even the emphasis put on the principles to be followed by supervisors are different and not always fully compatible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.72,0)">Moreover, the existence of a single supervisor for different financial activities does not prevent coordination problems occurring among the different areas of supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.73,0)">Those problems, by the way, would become less noticeable to the general public if they were under a "common roof".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.04,0)">In practice, the existence of a single authority could make it difficult to establish Chinese walls for information which not all supervisors need to know at a certain moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Indeed, Chinese walls are preferable to Chinese whispers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">In any case, I think that the trend towards conglomeration and cross-sector competition, if correctly addressed, would really point towards a need for a fundamental engagement of the NCBs in prudential supervision since the arguments mentioned before, which support their involvement, become even more relevant in a scenario of closer linkages and increased competition in the shared markets of banks, securities companies, asset managers and insurance companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This is not, of course, a black-and-white issue and there are valid arguments both for and against any solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Nevertheless, experience both in Europe and the United States clearly indicates that central banks are carrying out supervisory tasks effectively, whereas little experience has been gained of the application of the single agency model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">It seems indisputable that we have made progress – in particular since the launch of the euro – towards an integrated financial market structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.55,0)">However, the increased transparency resulting from the single currency has also made plain the magnitude of the remaining obstacles stemming from regulatory and fiscal divergences, as well as from the fragmentation of market infrastructures and conventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Hence, more action by authorities and private market participants – and close cooperation between them – are required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Further financial integration is in the clear interest of both banks and other financial institutions and central banks, and of public authorities in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">For banks, it means the liquidity benefits of deeper and wider markets and lower costs when making cross-border transactions, in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">From a central bank perspective, it enhances the efficient and consistent implementation of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Of course, just as important are the indisputable overall economic benefits of financial integration through a more efficient allocation of financial resources and risk-sharing, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">for the long-term goal of enhancing potential output growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In other words, after all this discussion I come back to where I started: the job of a central banker is to make sure that the economic party is sustainable in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">I should like to toast this goal, which is one shared by market participants and central bankers alike.</span>
