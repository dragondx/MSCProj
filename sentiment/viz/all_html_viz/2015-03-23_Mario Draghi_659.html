    <span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)"> Hearing at the European Parliament’s Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee   Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,Brussels, 23 March 2015 Jump to the transcript of the questions and answers Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of the ECON committee, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am happy to be back to this committee for my first regular hearing at the European Parliament in the year 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A lot has happened since we last met in November last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">With Lithuania, the euro welcomed its 19th member.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">On 22 January we announced our intention to extend our asset purchase programmes to buying public sector securities; we started the purchases on March We also moved to a new building which we officially inaugurated last week; we unveiled our new 20 euro banknote; and in a milestone towards even greater transparency of our decision-making procedures, we published on 19 February for the first time the accounts of a monetary policy meeting of the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I know this has always been a topic very dear to your committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In the remainder of my remarks, I will explain some important aspects of the extended asset purchase programme and present a first assessment of its effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I will then, as the coordinators have asked me to do, elaborate on the link between price stability and financial stability and will speak briefly about the macroprudential tools the ECB has now at its disposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Economic outlook and monetary policy The most recent data and survey evidence show that growth is gaining momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The basis for the economic recovery in the euro area has clearly strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">This is due to in particular the fall in oil prices, the gradual firming of external demand, easy financing conditions driven by our accomodative monetary policy, and the depreciation of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">These more positive developments are also reflected in the recent ECB staff projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.95,0)">Compared with the projections from December, the outlook for 2015 and 2016 has been visibly revised upwards by 0.5 and 0.4 pp., respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.71,0)">We expect inflation in the euro area to remain very low or negative in the months ahead, because the recent fall in oil prices will continue to influence the figures until later in the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">However, inflation rates are expected to start increasing gradually towards the end of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">They will be supported by aggregate demand, by the impact of the lower euro exchange rate and by the recovery of oil prices from their current troughs in the years ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The latest ECB staff projections foresee average inflation at 0.0% in 2015, rising to 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">A key factor for a full recovery of the euro area economy and ensuring that inflation does not remain too low for too long will be the extra stimulus that the Governing Council decided to introduce in January under the ECB’s expanded asset purchase program.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This decision was premised on two considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.33,0)">First, the momentum supporting the economic recovery was viewed as too weak and fragile to give us sufficient confidence that inflation would return to levels closer to 2% over a policy relevant medium-term horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.79,0)">Second, the expansive potential of the monetary policy measures that had been decided between June and October was seen as uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.59,0)">This was because they were largely dependent on banks’ own decision to borrow Eurosystem funds and lend them on to their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The cumulative uptake under the first two targeted long-term refinancing operations stood at around €212.4 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Therefore, the monetary impulse had to be reinforced and needed to be quantitatively more predictable and controllable to put the economy and the outlook for price stability on a firmer footing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">On 9 March, we started purchasing public-sector securities as part of our expanded asset purchase programme, which also comprises interventions in the ABS and covered bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Overall, our asset purchases will amount to €60 billion per month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The pace of purchases so far puts the overall program on track to reach a total of €60 billion in March.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">At this point in time we see no signs that there will not be enough bonds for us to purchase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Feedback from market participants so far suggests that implementation has been very smooth and that market liquidity remains ample.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Our interventions have accelerated a trend that had been evident since some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">A steady process of re-integration across financial markets and jurisdictions had been under way since the summer of 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">What is new today, however, is that lower interest rates in capital markets are increasingly being transmitted through the entire financial intermediation chain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.72,0)">Lower funding costs for banks have started to influence the cost of borrowing for households and companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">As bank lending rates are being reduced, new investment projects – previously considered unprofitable – become attractive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">In the short-run, this should sustain the demand for credit and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Indeed, the banks covered in our Bank Lending Survey confirm that the easing of lending conditions is progressing hand-in-hand with a resurgent demand for credit to finance business investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In the longer-term perspective, this will increase potential output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">We intend to carry out our purchases at least until end-September 2016, and in any case until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is consistent with our aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The Governing Council will take a holistic perspective when assessing the path of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">It will evaluate the likelihood for inflation not only to converge to levels that are closer to 2%, but also to stabilize around those levels with sufficient confidence thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">When doing this assessment, the Governing Council will follow its monetary policy strategy and concentrate on inflation trends, looking through any surprise in measured inflation   if judged to be transient and with no implications for the medium term outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">The positive results of our new purchase programme should not distract other stakeholders from delivering their contribution to put the economy back on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Fiscal policies should support economic growth, while ensuring debt sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">A full and consistent implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact is key for confidence in our fiscal framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Moreover, structural reforms should be implemented promptly and with determination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The combination of improved economic structures and sound fiscal policies indeed has the potential to make our monetary policy more effective by encouraging economic actors to take advantage of improved financing conditions and increase investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Price stability and financial stability Let me now turn, as suggested by the ECON coordinators, to the interaction between price stability and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Price stability is, as you know, the primary objective of the ECB and the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">And achieving price stability is a necessary condition for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.21,0)">Clearly, unstable inflation developments can distort a wide variety of macroeconomic and financial fluctuations, to the extent that these distortions become harmful for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.3,0)">For example, unstable inflation developments could complicate pricing of assets and blur the signals from relative asset price adjustments with detrimental effects on resource allocation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.68,0)">However, price stability is not a sufficient condition of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.08,0)">The last crisis proved that financial stability can be at risk even at times when price stability is achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.55,0)">And monetary policy decisions also affect expectations and a wide range of asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Our monetary policy measures are necessary to achieve our primary objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.95,0)">But we are nevertheless aware that they may have unintended side effects on the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.94,0)">For example, asset prices may increase to levels that are not justified by fundamentals, while periods of low yields and volatility may invite excessive risk taking by financial investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">In turn, such developments can act as an amplifying mechanism for any eventual financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">At the same time, financial stability is a precondition for the efficient conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">To be successful in delivering price stability, monetary policy relies on the effectiveness of the monetary transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In this context, a stable and non-fragmented financial system is important for the smooth transmission of monetary policy signals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.71,0)">We are monitoring closely any potential risks to euro area financial stability, including those from excessive risk taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Currently these risks are contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And should they emerge, macro-prudential policy would be best suited to address them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Recently, indeed some national authorities in the euro area have decided to implement such measures that go in the direction of preventing financial stability risks from emerging at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Regarding macro-prudential oversight of banks in the euro area, this is shared between national authorities and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.11,0)">The ECB may top-up specific national macro-prudential measures if it considers these insufficient to mitigate systemic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The ECB and the national authorities have at their disposal macro-prudential instruments for the banking sector, as provided in the Capital Requirements Directive and Regulation  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">These include capital buffers, such as the countercyclical capital buffer, systemic risk buffer and capital surcharges for systemic institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Additional measures may also be used to improve banks capital and liquidity position, limit their large exposures or increase capital requirements for certain asset classes, such as interbank and real estate exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">To make the most effective use of these instruments and strengthen the stability of the financial system, the ECB and national authorities regularly exchange information on macro-prudential policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Processes for formal notifications to the ECB by national authorities regarding intended measures have already been activated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Overall, the ECB will help to identify potential financial stability risks and foster a coordinated stance for macro-prudential policies among euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude by saying that I have always very much valued the exchange with your house both as an exercise of our accountability obligations and as a source of inspiration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">I am therefore very much looking forward to our debate and hope that we will now have time to discuss some of the matters for which time was too short at the plenary debate.</span>
