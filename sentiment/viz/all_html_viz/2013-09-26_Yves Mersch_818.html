    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)"> A regime change in supervision and resolution Keynote Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, European Supervisor Education   Conference, Frankfurt, 26 September 2013 Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for inviting me to speak today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.98,0)">As you know, Europe has in recent years faced the worst economic and financial crisis since the 1930s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.52,0)">Growth remains weak and unemployment is unacceptably high, with only the first shoots of recovery showing through.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Yet out of these difficulties, some positives have begun to emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The euro area has recognised that, for its collective stability, it has to deepen integration in certain areas – and it is now beginning to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">What we are seeing playing out today is not so much the “audacity of hope”, but rather the “audacity of necessity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In my view, the most significant change taking place is the development of Banking Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Monetary Union needs Banking Union, not least because a stable banking sector is an essential complement to a sound money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">I therefore see the project of building Banking Union as the most important integration step since the launch of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">For those of us involved in supervision and other financial sector issues, it is an especially fascinating time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">We are at what political scientists call a “critical juncture” – that rare time when a window of opportunity opens to fundamentally redesign institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It feels like being back 25 years ago when we were preparing EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.74,0)">But this also imposes on us a responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This window may not open again for many years, so we need to make sure that the decisions we take today are the right ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Most importantly, we need to ensure that Banking Union is not just a label – that it initiates a genuine regime change in the way that banks are supervised and resolved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">How to achieve this regime change is what I would like to focus on in my remarks today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The elements of a regime change In my view, a genuine regime change has to involve two elements: first, building a single system for banking supervision and resolution; and, once that is in place, building a stricter system as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.6,0)">Why do we need both elements?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">We need a single system to ensure that we have a level playing field for the banking sector across Europe – and hence to create a truly single financial market in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.09,0)">20 years after the Single Market was supposed to be completed, the banking sector in Europe remains fragmented along national lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.44,0)">This has many drawbacks, not least that it disrupts monetary policy transmission, makes banks more exposed to country-specific shocks, and encourages home bias in government bond purchases that strengthen the bank-sovereign loop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.1,0)">To give an example of how far short we remain of a fully integrated financial market, a recent study found that, between 2005 and 2012, the average number of bank mergers and acquisitions per year in the United States was 343, whereas in Europe the yearly average was just 58.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.28,0)">One reason for this is that we have lacked a single system of supervision and resolution across Europe, which has discouraged cross-border activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">We need a stricter system to ensure that, when we have the new tools of Banking Union, they are used proactively – namely, to create a stronger and more stable banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">We still have an uphill struggle in Europe to restore investor confidence in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.92,0)">And this is partly because we do not have a consistently strict approach to banks – on balance sheet transparency, on loss recognition and on resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.3,0)">Evidence of this is the divergence in the price-to-book ratio for large and complex banks in the euro area and outside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.31,0)">For banks outside it is currently around 1, while for euro area banks it is only 0.7 – in other words, euro area banks are priced by the market at less than their book value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">An important reason for this is that countries outside the euro area have made much faster progress in acknowledging losses and resolving banks that were not viable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Creating a genuine regime change, both in the system of supervision and resolution and in its application, could therefore have a powerful effect for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">In the near term, it could help accelerate the clean-up of banks’ balance sheets and thus restart bank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">In the medium term, it could help encourage the development of genuinely European banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">So how do we get to this regime change?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Building a single system Let me start with the first element, building a single system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In my view, for any system to be single, two conditions have to be fulfilled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.62,0)">First, there needs to be a single set of rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Second, if those rules contain any discretion, there needs to be a central authority that can enforce them evenly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">A single system for supervision For supervision, we are currently making progress on both these conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In terms of rules, we now have a new rulebook for banks across Europe as part of the Capital Requirements Directive IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Within the single supervisory mechanism  , we will also have a single supervisory manual that will apply to all banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This will cover issues like the methodology for the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process  , off-site and on-site reviews, risk assessments and model validations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">We are thereby ensuring that the same supervisory standards will be applied across Banking Union – and indeed, through harmonisation with the European Banking Authority, across the EU as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">In terms of decision-making, we are strengthening the centre by integrating the European and national levels of supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">A particular innovation here will be the Joint Supervisory Teams, which will contain staff from both the ECB and the national competent authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There will be one team for each significant banking group directly supervised by the SSM, operating under the management of a coordinator working for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">This guarantees a collective approach and ensures that there will always be a European element in the decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.4,0)">Indeed, the final responsibility for decisions will rest with the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This process of creating an integrated SSM is of course a major organisational challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We are bringing together 17 or more different national supervisors, with different operating cultures and supervisory philosophies, into a single mechanism with a single culture and philosophy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">And the ECB will be directly hiring around 1,000 new staff, of which around 750 will be involved in supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">So it will take time to reach our cruising speed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.05,0)">With the SSM Regulation foreseen to enter into force at the beginning of November, we are ready to publish the vacancy notice for the Chair of the Supervisory Board, followed by those for the top management of the SSM – the four Directors General of the main departments and the six Deputy Directors General.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The vacancy notices for the middle management will follow a few weeks later, and then – in accordance with the cascade principle – the broad recruitment will begin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We need to be ready with the basic structure of the organisation for the Asset Quality Review   towards the end of the first quarter of 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me therefore briefly take this opportunity to describe how we foresee the SSM’s organisational structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.64,0)">The SSM will contain four Directorates General and a Secretariat Division.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Two of the Directorates General   will conduct the direct and day-to-day supervision over significant banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The division of responsibility for supervision between these two departments will be largely determined according to a risk-based approach, allowing them to specialise by risk exposure, complexity and business model of the credit institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The third Directorate General   will host the conduct of indirect supervision over less significant banking groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Direct supervision of these banks will still be carried out by the relevant national competent authorities   on a day-to-day basis, but with regular reporting to the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The fourth Directorate General   will perform horizontal supervision and specialised expertise functions, such as supervisory quality assurance, methodology and standards development, enforcement and sanctions, crisis management, capital market risk analysis and model validation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Within the organisational set-up, the middle management below the Directors General will encompass Heads of Division and Section and Senior Advisors, from which the Joint Supervisory Team   coordinators will be chosen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me also say a few words on how we foresee the practical work and the organisation of the off- and on-site-supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The Joint Supervisory Teams   are responsible for the day-to-day supervision of significant banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">They propose inspections, in which they participate without leading the inspections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.55,0)">That task is allocated to the Head of Mission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The Head of Mission is nominated by the horizontal Directorate General, Micro-Prudential Supervision IV – that is, by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.49,0)">Generally, on-site inspection teams are led by NCA staff.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This does not preclude, however, the possibility of the ECB taking the lead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The JSTs prepare the recommendations, lead the closing meeting of the inspection with the credit institution, and provide the follow-up of the recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The horizontal DG is in charge of maintaining the on-site inspection methodology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Moreover, it plans the on-site inspections to be conducted at significant banks on a yearly basis and updates on a half yearly basis the global inspection planning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">On-site inspections are specific in-depth investigations of risks, risk controls and governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">They are carried out on the basis of a predefined scope, timeline and resources, and use investigating and inspecting techniques to test controls and substantive procedures, following common standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">They follow specific procedures and are conducted in an independent manner – vis-à-vis the JST, the NCAs and the respective inspected credit institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The outcome of on-site inspections will be a report containing findings and an executive summary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">A single system for resolution A single system for resolution is just as important as a single system for supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.45,0)">Banks need to know how they will be treated both in life and in death – as do the creditors that invest in them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">So here again, having a single set of rules and a central authority that can enforce them is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The single set of rules for resolution – the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive – has already been agreed by the Council of the European Union, and discussions are now under way with the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In principle, I welcome this Directive as a vast improvement on the status quo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.35,0)">Before the crisis very few countries had resolution frameworks in place, and this has led to ad hoc and inconsistent approaches in different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.27,0)">However, where I think this Directive falls short is in the discretion it still allows to national resolution authorities to exempt certain classes of liabilities from bail-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.02,0)">In my view, this is not conducive to the building of a single system, as it leaves too much uncertainty about how bail-in will be applied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.46,0)">One can imagine a situation, for example, where a particular class of investors is excluded from bail-in owing to national political economy concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Or a situation where larger countries with larger resolution funds are in a position to exclude more creditors than smaller countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.14,0)">Investors will be forced to second-guess these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In this context, having an authority that can take central decisions becomes even more important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">If there is going to be discretion in how resolution rules are applied, then we need to ensure that this discretion is applied in the same way across different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This underscores why a strong single resolution mechanism is so necessary – and, more concretely, why that mechanism has to have independent decision-making powers and no national vetoes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">A single resolution mechanism is also essential to ensure that we have a single approach to the resolution of cross-border banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.41,0)">Dividing resolution along national lines has not proven an efficient way to solve cross-border coordination problems and achieve a least-cost resolution strategy overall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.15,0)">Moreover, in a divided system we can anticipate protracted wrangling over burden-sharing, which only delays the clean-up from a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To address this issue, I see it as essential that the mechanism comprises not only a single resolution authority, but also a single resolution fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The Commission’s proposal for the single resolution mechanism foresees such a fund, financed by levies on private banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">According to Commission estimates, it will reach a size of about €55 billion by 2025.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">I welcome this proposal in principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.16,0)">But I think that, during the build-up phase, clarification is needed on what will happen if there are exceptional circumstances which lead to the fund’s resources being exhausted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.97,0)">The proposal is unclear here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In my view a credible backstop is essential to ensure that resolution costs can be separated from national budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">To sum up, what defines a single system is having a single set of rules that can be enforced evenly from the centre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">We are on the way to achieving this for supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">I see it as essential that we also achieve it for resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Banking Union is ultimately a way of establishing a single financial market where banks are separated from their sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">To paraphrase Mervyn King, we therefore need to ensure that banks are both European in life and European in death.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Building a stricter system Let me turn to the second element of a genuine regime change, building a stricter system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Putting in place new rules and institutions for supervising and resolving banks is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">But it is equally important to use them in a way that leads to a measurably stronger and more stable banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">How can we achieve this?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">A new approach to supervision The first building block is a willingness on the part of policy-makers to make bank balance sheets more transparent according to the common standards of the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The SSM Regulation puts us in a position to do this by requiring a comprehensive assessment of the banks the ECB will directly supervise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This requirement goes beyond a purely accounting exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We have to ensure that the assessment is rigorous and managed from the centre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.75,0)">There is no point in having a new pair of glasses if you are not willing to open your eyes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Our current plan for the comprehensive assessment is to have three elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">First, a risk assessment, which will identify broad risk factors, including funding and liquidity risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Second, a balance sheet assessment, which will review asset quality using calculation, qualification and valuation checks of a broad risk-based nature, with central quality assurance according to a common methodology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">This will draw on the expertise of external consultants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Third, a stress test, which will apply the results to an adverse scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.89,0)">The linkages between the balance sheet assessment and the stress test still need to be defined in detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What is clear, however, is that both are communicating vessels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">If the former is a more thorough point-in-time stock-taking, then the later has to contain more forward looking elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.34,0)">As a consequence of this three-pronged exercise, some banks might face capital gaps to close.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">In our view, it is very important for the credibility of the exercise that the scope of the process remains ambitious; this implies, for example, that a data integrity validation is undertaken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Of course, we need to be alert to the practical concerns of the stakeholders of the exercise, including the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is important that all requirements for the banks are clearly defined, finalised, explained and delivered to them well ahead of the official starting date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Ideally, the final templates, including the accompanying instructions on how to use them, should no longer be altered once data is being compiled for the balance sheet assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But we will not compromise on the scope and strictness of the exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">We would like to launch the exercise, starting with the determination of the risk portfolios, by the end of this year already – although this depends to some extent on when the full Supervisory Board is appointed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">I am confident that, once the SSM Regulation has been approved, the ECB and the European Parliament can work in a constructive spirit in appointing the Supervisory Board – in particular in ensuring a fast-track procedure for the appointment of the Chair.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">When we have the results of the assessment, policy-makers also need to be willing to deal with the consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Certainly, European banks are in a stronger position today than they were a few years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">For example, in Spain banks have provisioned €184 billion euro – that is 10.5% of their loan books – and have raised €22 billion in new equity since 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But we cannot rule out the possibility that the exercise will still reveal capital needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">It is essential that there are backstops in place to address this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.56,0)">If the backstops are not there, I fear that the exercise will create a lose-lose situation for the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.23,0)">If the results reveal only small capital needs, markets will think they have been fudged to save public money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.2,0)">If they reveal significant capital needs, markets will question how they will be filled, creating uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.16,0)">Either way the confidence boost we hope to gain from the assessment will be lost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">A new approach to resolution The second building block of a stricter system involves changing the way in which we deal with non-viable banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">To begin with, we need to make sure that we use the new resolution powers to their full extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.66,0)">As most European countries do not have much experience with winding down banks, there may be a tendency to avoid putting banks into resolution – by practising supervisory forbearance and allowing banks ever more time to restore viability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The ECB as supervisor has an important role to play here in ensuring that this does not happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">To ensure that resolution powers are used in full, it would also help to have all the elements of the new resolution framework in place at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The supervisory powers of the SSM will apply in principle from November 2014 onwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive framework is foreseen to take effect in January 2015, and the start of the single resolution mechanism is planned for the same date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But under the current agreement, the new provisions on bail-in would only be applicable from January 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.86,0)">This means that there will be a period of three years where the resolution authority is unable to use one of its key resolution tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">For this reason, I favour bringing forward the entry into force of bail-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The Directive still has to be agreed with the European Parliament, and in my view we should push for a start date of 2015 for bail-in so that we have the full resolution toolbox available from the outset – instead of over-extending the State Aid rules as a proxy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.22,0)">What I have tried to illustrate today is that a regime change involves two components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">First, the right rules and institutions to ensure a single system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Second, a willingness to use those rules and institutions in a stricter manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.69,0)">It is therefore a question not only of mechanisms, but also of mindsets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We have already made some encouraging progress, in particular on the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">But there is still a long way to go, and success is only possible with a cooperative effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Whether Banking Union achieves a regime change will ultimately depend on the cooperation and dedication of literally thousands of legislators, regulators and supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is the very definition of a “team effort”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">In the same vein, we need to strengthen our joint training efforts in supervision skills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The European Supervisor Education initiative is an example of a common cross-border approach which could be built upon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Yet in my view Banking Union is the challenge of our times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The crisis has presented us with a once-in-a-generation opportunity: to build a safer banking sector; to strengthen our Monetary Union; and in the process to take forward the historical process of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">We are privileged to have this opportunity – and we need to take it.</span>
