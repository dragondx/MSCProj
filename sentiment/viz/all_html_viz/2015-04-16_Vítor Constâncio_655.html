    <h3> Speaker: Vítor Constâncio </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)"> Financial regulation and the global recovery Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB,at the 24th Annual Hyman P. Minsky Conference “Is financial reregulation holding back finance for the global recovery?”,Washington, 16 April 2015 *** This is the full text of a speech delivered in abridged form in Washington on 16 April *** Ladies and gentlemen, Let me begin by thanking the Levy Institute and specially its President, Dimitri Papadimitriou, for inviting me to speak again at the Annual Conference honouring Hyman Minsky.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">This year’s theme is quite topical and opens the door to a lively debate about the role of finance and regulation, both in the crisis period and in the moderate recovery underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The recovery is however still to achieve the closing of negative output gaps on both sides of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.16,0)">It could then be expected that different views emerge about the regulatory reform efforts that are not yet concluded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Let me mention four.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.44,0)">According to one view, the crisis and its recessionary effects result from the excesses of finance and insufficient regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This implies that the main effort should be to tame finance in order to avoid future crises of the same type.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.33,0)">In this vein, it could be expected that deep reforms of the international financial regulation would follow the acknowledged failure of the legal framework in place before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Two well-known specialists in the field, Barry Eichengreen and Eric Helleiner have very recently published two books   explaining why a transformative reform of the international system has indeed not occurred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.65,0)">Eichengreen explains it the following way: “…depression and financial collapse were avoided, if barely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This fostered the belief that the flaws of the prevailing system were less.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.54,0)">It weakened the argument for radical action  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Success thus became the mother of failure.” This sounds perhaps too harsh because good work has been done in adopting measures in the domains of capital, liquidity and resolution of banks in order to increase the resilience of the banking sector, within the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.63,0)">Much less has been achieved beyond banks, notably in what regards OTC derivatives or non-bank entities, including activities of the so-called shadow banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">However, as remarked by Helleiner, financial reform saw the emergence of a promising innovation in the form of macro-prudential policy: a policy that uses regulatory measures to deal with system-wide financial risk and the smoothing of the financial cycle, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.99,0)">the fluctuations of credit financing, leverage and asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This goal is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.88,0)">Nevertheless, some economists and policy makers continue to view this with scepticism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.37,0)">Monetary policy cannot simultaneously cope with two different objectives and the need for macro-prudential policy has become more acute with the realisation that advanced economies are very likely to face a prolonged period of low real and nominal growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In such an environment, monetary policy has to remain accommodative, with low interest rates which foster search for yield and froth in asset markets, making the use of macro-prudential policy – to strengthen institutions, to smooth the financial cycle and to pre-empt asset bubbles – more necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Without an effective macro-prudential policy, advanced economies will not be able to avoid financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.41,0)">This means that regulatory reform has to continue until appropriate instruments are put in place to deal with the non-bank financial sector, which is increasingly taking the role of credit intermediation previously performed by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The concentration of reform measures on the banking sector has led to an expansion of shadow banking or the market-based financing sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">The investment fund industry doubled in size in the last five years in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">The financial system is expanding in new dimensions and new risks are emerging in terms of maturity transformation and leverage, especially synthetic leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.84,0)">Another view on the regulatory reform is rooted on a sceptical perspective about the possibility of taming finance, accepting that booms and busts are simply unavoidable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">After adopting some measures to increase the resilience of financial institutions in terms of capital and liquidity, the policy concern is about how macroeconomic policy should be used to mitigate the effects on the real economy stemming from endogenous financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Monetary policy would “mop-up the mess” via liquidity provision after the bust and would help the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">For the more Keynesian-inclined minds, this should extend to the use of fiscal policy, especially in an environment of low interest rates near the zero lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It is true that monetary policy is nowadays considered the most powerful of the macro policies to stabilise the economy, but it is important to be aware of its limitations, especially near the zero lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">It is sometimes said that the world avoided the worst in 2008 only because central banks made bold use of their tools, notably by cutting rates and providing abundant liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">But the truth is that without the significant use of fiscal policy in 2008 and 2009, stimulating our economies and supporting the banking sector, the meltdown of the financial system would perhaps not have been avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">At the meeting in Toronto in 2010, the G20 decided to reverse this policy and embarked in fiscal consolidation, to different degrees, leaving monetary policy alone to deal with macroeconomic stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.71,0)">In this context, the double dip suffered by the euro area economy after 2011 is easier to explain by fiscal policy short-term effects, than by the behaviour of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.99,0)">In a European Commission   working paper  , using the EC Quest model, Jan Veld finds that the cumulative impact from simultaneous fiscal consolidation in 2011 to 2013  , ranged from 8.1 % in Germany or 9.7% in Spain to 18% in Greece, in terms of GDP losses in relation to baseline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.8,0)">In the same vein, Rannenberg, Schoderand and Strasky     find a cumulative negative effect of consolidation for the euro area in 2011-2013 of 14%, using a variant of the Quest model, and of 15% using a variant of the ECB’s New Area-Wide Model  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Despite the fact that several European countries had to implement deficit reductions, these model-based calculations, with all their caveats, illustrate the importance of macroeconomic policy in determining the outcome of financial crises for the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Coming back to the conference theme, a third view about the regulatory reform, supports a positive answer to the question: “Is financial reregulation holding back finance for the global recovery?”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.03,0)">It concludes that regulatory reform has gone too far and that by constraining finance it is hampering the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.89,0)">However, it would first have to be proven that investment and growth are being significantly affected by financing supply constraints in order to validate this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.06,0)">This does not seem to be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.51,0)">Evidence points more in the direction of a general lack of demand and weak growth prospects to explain low investment and the modest recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.15,0)">The desperate search for growth and jobs by governments and policy makers, following seven years of gradual reforms, could give some credence to this view amidst feelings of reform fatigue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.02,0)">However, I argue that it would be wrong to listen to these opinions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The pace of the recovery is not being affected by lack of finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Finance would be abundant if there were investment projects with prospects of good return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">A fourth possible answer to the conference’s question relates to a “liquidationist” view that amazingly surfaced again, in spite of the lessons from the 1930’s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.63,0)">Its defenders claim that macroeconomic policies, aimed at mitigating the recessionary consequences of the crisis, do more harm than good in the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">However, some accept that reforms to strengthen capital and liquidity buffers in credit institutions were necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.66,0)">According to this view, the crisis stemmed from excessive credit, debt and bad investments and thus, deleveraging and liquidation of bad capital must happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.77,0)">Applying a very accommodative monetary policy to fight recession would risk inflation or, in the more modern guise of the doctrine, would lead to asset price bubbles and future crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.95,0)">Consequently, monetary policy, in view of the alleged ineffectiveness of macro-prudential policy, should have become restrictive since 2011 or 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">According to this reasoning, precedence should be given to the financial cycle over the stabilisation of the business cycle or, in more telling terms, precedence should be given to the risk of asset price bubbles over the risks of deflation and unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Acknowledging that my description of these four different opinions has hardly been neutral, in my view, a combination of the first and second approaches is the appropriate response to the question setting the conference theme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Nevertheless, I want to clearly state that the financial regulatory reform has to be completed and extended through further efforts to contain risks in the so called shadow banking sector and to strenghten macro-prudential policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Believing that advanced economies face a protracted period of low growth that requires accommodative monetary policy, I see no alternative to regulatory macro-prudential instruments to mitigate financial instability and crises by smoothening the financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.04,0)">Naturally, we should be aware that taming finance is a challenging, if ever achievable task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">As Minsky put it in the last sentence of his book “Stabilizing an unstable economy”: “There is no possibility that we can ever set things right once and for all; instability, put to rest by a set of reforms will, after time, emerge in a new guise”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Nevertheless, our countries have experienced long tranquil periods, without financial crises in the past, and we should now aim to return to that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">I already stated that re-regulating finance is, in my view, not an obstacle to the ongoing recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In last year’s conference, I argued that “fixing finance” was not enough to ensure higher economic growth  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This does not mean that I do not consider finance vital for a healthy economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">A well-functioning financial system is essential to foster long-term economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In this respect, last autumn was characterised by two milestones in Europe: the completion of the asset quality review and stress tests and the start of the Single Supervisory Mechanism, which went live on 4 November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Repairing banks’ balance-sheets, together with the advancements in the design of the new resolution framework, the regulatory reforms improving capital and liquidity standards, as well as those concerning the shadow banking system  , constitute clear evidence of the commitment of the ECB and other EU policy makers to restore a well-functioning financial sector and create the conditions for an adequate flow of credit to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">These successes took place against the background of slow growth and subdued inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Despite recent encouraging signs, the recovery in Europe remains gradual and moderate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In the European context, the subject of this conference is therefore very pertinent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">I already gave my general answer in favour of completing the regulatory reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.85,0)">In what follows, I will further substantiate my arguments in favour of that position and will express my concern with the insufficient attention paid so far to the growing risks in the shadow banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">A Defence of regulatory reform The beneficial impact of regulation on growth Financial institutions support and foster economic growth by intermediating savings and allocating them to productive activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.64,0)">These functions are also their inherent sources of financial fragility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Regulation plays a key role in reducing the scope of financial fragility and limiting the costs of financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Hence, a well-designed regulatory framework can actually lead to faster average economic growth over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There is vast academic literature that tries to empirically identify the impact of financial deepening   on long-term economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The pre-crisis evidence largely pointed to a positive relationship between financial deepening and long-term economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">However, recent evidence has cast doubt on such a simple monotone relationship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.75,0)">Several studies have shown that at high level of financial development, the effect of finance on growth becomes negative or insignificant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Cecchetti and Kharroubi     put the peak of the effect of credit on GDP growth per worker at a 100% ratio of private credit to GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.94,0)">In other words, letting the financial system grow too much may harm the economy’s growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Correspondingly, regulating finance may stimulate rather than retard economic development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.97,0)">Regulation, like any form of public intervention, is justified by the existence of market failures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Financial regulation is not an exception to this, even though it is somewhat “unique” given the special role that banks perform in the economy and the high   costs associated to the failure of a financial institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Financial regulation is meant to correct financial institutions’ incentives toward risk, to induce them to internalise the costs and the externalities associated to their failures, thus reducing both the occurrence of crises and the associated costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Limiting the occurrence of crises has a positive effect on growth for several reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.65,0)">Crises affect growth asymmetrically: activity falls much more sharply during a crisis than it increases during credit booms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.91,0)">Their negative effect on growth is very long-lasting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.79,0)">An empirical investigation focusing on a large cross section of countries shows that output losses associated with financial crises are highly persistent and may range from 4% to 16%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.72,0)">When the financial sector is in distress, entrepreneurs’ access to credit is impaired with negative effects on the investment of existing firms as well on new business creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.12,0)">Recoveries from financial crises tend to be slow, ‘creditless’ and ‘jobless’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.51,0)">Even if regulation reduces economic growth in normal times, its impact on average economic growth can still be positive over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.14,0)">But there is a further argument as to why regulation may have a positive effect on growth: without regulation, the financial sector may become excessively large and displace other, more productive activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Recent growth in the financial system has not necessarily led to more credit availability for innovative businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In the last two decades, banks in developed economies have channelled an increasing amount of funds to households rather than firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">More and more savings have flowed into low productivity growth sectors like real estate rather than into growth enhancing activities such as technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.63,0)">In addition, the growth of the financial sector and the high remuneration it offers may have drawn talented individuals away from other productive sectors in the economy since financial and non-financial sectors compete for the same scarce supply of human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.54,0)">The need to limit its excessive growth applies not only to the financial system as a whole but also to individual institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.09,0)">I am referring here to the well-known too-big-to-fail problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.68,0)">The recent crisis highlighted the risk of letting individual institutions grow excessively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Some of the recent regulatory changes   can play a crucial role in solving such a problem, as I will discuss in detail below.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.49,0)">In short, the long-term relationship between finance and growth is complex and non-linear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">But the theory and evidence suggests that effective regulation is likely to be beneficial in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.52,0)">What about the short-term impact of regulation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">There are good theoretical reasons to believe that capital ratios’ effect on growth should not be overly large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.07,0)">The famous Modigliani-Miller   ‘irrelevance’ result   states that firms’   business decisions are independent of their capital structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Of course, the MM insight is developed in a highly idealised setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">For example, the tax advantages of debt and the liquidity services performed by short-term bank liabilities do drive a wedge between the cost of debt and equity for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.52,0)">But the empirical papers that have estimated this wedge have found it to be small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Regulators have gone to considerable length to assess the impact of the various regulatory initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The regular quantitative impact assessments undertaken by the Basel Committee show that most reporting banks have made significant progress to meet the new regulatory requirements for capital and liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">The European Commission has published a comprehensive study that aims to estimate the joint economic impact of many regulatory initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This study comes to the conclusion that the expected costs of the reforms will be compensated by the wider economic and societal benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Moreover, specific assessments have been made with regard to the macroeconomic impact of stronger capital, liquidity requirements and OTC derivative reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">In the European context, the European Banking Authority and the Commission have assessed the macroeconomic impact of the regulatory reform for insurance companies and broadened the assessment with regard to the Liquidity Coverage Ratio and currently with regard to the Net Stable Funding Ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Overall, the evidence available from these studies demonstrates a positive or neutral impact on GDP growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.45,0)">Slow growth in Europe has many structural causes So what is the cause of slow economic growth if not regulation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">GDP growth comes from three main sources: greater productive efficiency  , labour force increases and capital deepening  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.69,0)">The contribution of all three factors has been declining over time and across countries as part of what has been termed ‘secular stagnation’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.37,0)">The main reason why labour force growth has declined is population ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.17,0)">As the number of older retired people grows, the labour force is expected to decline at a rate of around 0.6% per annum by 2030.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.5,0)">TFP growth has remained subdued at a rate of expansion of around 1% per annum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The determinants of TFP growth are not fully understood but among others, Robert Gordon   has argued that TFP growth occurs in waves, driven by major innovations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">So far, despite its great promise, the ICT revolution of the 1990s has not led to a pronounced and sustained pick-up in productivity growth in any of the major industrialised countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.6,0)">Finally, the rate of capital deepening   has been weak in recent years reflecting low aggregate demand, financing constraints and weak business confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The contribution of this growth driver is expected to return to more normal levels as the economic recovery proceeds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.98,0)">Compared to these structural reasons for the slowdown in growth, the impact of financial regulation has been modest, at best.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.82,0)">Another related consequence of secular stagnation may be that the natural real interest rate   has fallen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.81,0)">Population ageing has shifted the balance between older households who are likely to save and younger households who are likely to borrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.0,0)">As a result, real interest rates have declined substantially in the last two decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.27,0)">Nominal interest rates have also fallen in line with the real, leaving the ‘normal’ central bank policy rate much closer to the zero bound, thus increasing the likelihood of hitting it during deep recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.25,0)">Without getting into a discussion about the merits and risks of unconventional monetary policy, it is probably fair to say that the zero lower bound on nominal interest rates complicates the task of monetary policy in trying to stabilise large shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.4,0)">Financial crises are some of the largest peace-time negative shocks to hit market economies and our ability to use monetary policy in order to deal with them ‘ex-post’ would be impaired in a secular stagnation world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This makes the role of regulation in avoiding financial crises more important than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.9,0)">When it comes to dealing with financial crises, prevention is always better than cure but especially so when ‘mopping-up after the crash’ is complicated by the inability to cut short-term interest rates sufficiently far below zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">What has been achieved and what is in the pipeline?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">We have seen that, far from damaging growth, a strong regulatory framework is essential in ensuring strong long-term economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Let me now briefly touch upon the key achievements of the efforts to reform the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">We have increased capital requirements well above the levels in force before the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">This will make banks more resilient to shocks and reduce their incentives to take excessive risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">We have identified the most systemically important institutions and require them to have additional capital buffers reflecting the significant externalities their failure would impose on the financial system and the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The introduction of the two liquidity ratios will make banks more resilient against sudden liquidity and funding shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">These reforms were changes necessary to the regulatory framework but are, in my view, not yet sufficient for a stable financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In view of the current rhetoric of reform fatigue, it is important stress that we still need to finalise several important initiatives that are currently under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">They are all needed in order to effectively correct market failures and with the minimum of cost to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">TLAC, the leverage ratio and the review of risk weights would help underpin the effectiveness of capital regulation in avoiding excessive risk-taking and protecting the real economy from the consequences of bank failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The attempts to broaden non-bank funding sources in Europe via improved and safer securitisation practices, as well as capital markets union, should reduce the negative consequences of bank deleveraging now as well as in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Total Loss Absorption Capacity Let me begin with the TLAC initiative targeting the most systemically important banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Too-big-to-fail is a very important source of market failures and I consider TLAC as an important element in effectively tackling this distortion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Allow me to highlight three elements of the proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">First of all, the Financial Stability Board   is right in proposing a global Pillar 1 requirement with the possibility to apply additional Pillar 2 requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">A pillar 1 requirement delivers a robust international standard for globally systemic important banks and ensures, at the same time, a global level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Second, I agree with a Total Loss Absorbency approach with the capital buffers on top.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Having the buffers sit on top of TLAC ensures that they can function as intended, regardless of the TLAC calibration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.54,0)">Additionally, it allows for a very strict intervention mechanism for TLAC non-compliance as for the duration of the breach of the buffer requirement, the automatic distribution restrictions specified in Basel III would apply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Third, I agree with benchmarking TLAC eligible liabilities against a non-risked weighted measure   in addition to risk-weighted assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Under the assumption that TLAC is appropriately calibrated, this ensures that for a failing bank, when risks have materialised and risk-weights do not matter anymore, the actual loss can be compensated and the bank successfully recapitalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Nevertheless, I acknowledge that industry has raised several important issues to the TLAC proposal, in particular relating to the size of the required TLAC market, the impact on bank funding costs, the calibration and the link with the leverage ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Let me assure you that we take these issues seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">This is why the FSB is performing a thorough impact assessment in close collaboration with the ECB and other members of the Basel Committee  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This assessment includes a shortfall analysis, a market survey to obtain estimates on investor base and pricing/spread of eligible liabilities, a micro- and macro-economic impact analysis and a verification of historical losses and recapitalisation - to analyse the proposed calibration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.79,0)">Having said this, all regulatory reform, and TLAC in particular, have an impact on the cost of doing business for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">And insofar as the increase in funding costs is the result of the effective removal of the implicit state guarantee this is, in principle, welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The benefits of the removal of the implicit guarantee outweigh the individual increase in costs for society as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.89,0)">Tax payers and their elected representatives have no appetite for another bail-out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">TLAC will significantly reduce the externalities of a failure of systemically important institutions that are imposed on the real economy and will therefore have an overall positive effect on growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">The Leverage Ratio The finalisation of the Leverage Ratio   framework should also be a key priority on the global regulatory reform agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.64,0)">Leverage was undoubtedly one of the root causes of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.38,0)">The 20 largest banks in Europe had built-up significant leverage before the financial crisis, as their ratios of Book Equity to Total Assets   had fallen from 6% in the late 1990s to around 3% in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Hence, a comprehensive and well-calibrated leverage ratio is an important tool for addressing such risks that might be circumvented or not captured by the risk-based framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">I therefore strongly support the migration of the LR to a Pillar 1 requirement, as foreseen by the Basel Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">I also see a need to complement the micro-prudential minimum LR requirement by a macro-prudential LR framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">In particular, further work should be undertaken on the pros and cons of adding a buffer for systemically important banks to the LR framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.01,0)">Large banks contribute most to excessive leverage with their greater costs of failure and their greater reliance on internal models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Further work looking at the relationship between the LR and the risk-based framework should be undertaken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">For example, policy makers could consider adding a time-varying buffer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Such a buffer could help maintain the relative role of the LR in the capital framework once the countercyclical buffer is activated in the risk-based framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.47,0)">There are some concerns about a negative impact of a binding LR requirement on lending to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.53,0)">Critics of the LR often argue that it would trigger significant additional capital requirements and, as a consequence, may make it more costly for banks to finance the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.06,0)">However, I believe that these concerns are overstated for three reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">First, as already mentioned, there are many reasons to believe that the impact of the higher capital requirements on growth in normal times should not be overly large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">In any case, the latest Basel QIS study shows that the large majority of banks already satisfy the currently envisaged 3% minimum requirement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Any additional impact would be modest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Second, even if the LR leads to some contraction in lending, it may still be good for long-run growth if it helps to avoid costly crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Finally, there is a more subtle effect by which the LR may actually help improve lending to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Recent evidence on risk-weights for SME lending in Europe   shows that the average capital cost for this activity in the risk-based framework is higher than under the LR.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">This would imply that in a situation where the LR becomes the binding measure for a subset of banks, banks may potentially increase SME lending at the expense of other activities, which have a preferential treatment in the risk-based framework relative to the LR framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">I would encourage further work on this matter that would present evidence on the significance of this effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Risk Weights Let me now turn to another key lesson we learnt in the aftermath of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.91,0)">The BCBS has shown that significant differences exist in the way banks estimate PDs and LGDs   resulting in the reported capital ratios varying by as much as 2 percentage points for banks with similar exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.88,0)">We must address this variability of risks-weights, and bank’s overreliance on internal models that produce them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.71,0)">Variability of risk-weights may arise because of data scarcity and complexity of models, but may also be a consequence of banks gaming the risk-weights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Behn et al     provide an example of recent empirical work that clearly reveals this gaming behaviour within banks’ use of internal models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">By exploiting the staggered introduction of the model-based approach in Germany, Behn et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">show that   internal risk estimates employed for regulatory purposes systematically underpredict actual default rates by 0.5 to 1 percentage points;   both default rates and loss rates are higher for loans that were originated under the model-based approach, while corresponding risk-weights are significantly lower; and   interest rates are higher for loans originated under the model-based approach, suggesting that banks were aware of the higher risk associated with these loans and priced them accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Fortunately, the BCBS has stepped up its efforts in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">First, it has recently published a consultation paper on its new capital floor framework based on standardised approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">These floors will limit the extent to which internal models can lower capital requirements relative to the standardised approach and therefore ensure that the level of capital across the banking system does not fall below a certain level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Second, the BCBS has recently established the high-level Task Force on Simplicity and Comparability mandated to undertake a strategic review of the capital framework in order to reduce reliance on models for some risks and portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">I expect both strands of work not only to improve the resilience of financial institutions but also to have a positive impact on lending to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.65,0)">Empirical evidence on the behaviour of German banks during the crisis suggests that loans subject to internal model capital charges were reduced significantly more than loans under the standardised approach to capital regulation, supporting the view that internal models are relatively more pro-cyclical than the standardised approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The cited paper shows that, for the German banking system, loans subject to model-based, time-varying capital charges were reduced by 3.5 percent more than loans under the traditional approach to capital regulation, during the financial crisis Hence, increasing the relative importance of the standardised approach should help to smooth the credit cycle, in particular by making deleveraging episodes less severe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Securitisation Another important strand of work, strongly pushed by the ECB in collaboration with the Bank of England, is the revitalisation of the securitisation market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">When performed with proper regard to loan underwriting standards, securitisation can play a very important role in diversifying bank funding sources, freeing bank capital and allocating risk more efficiently within the EU financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.54,0)">This is particularly important in the current stage of bank balance sheet deleveraging when other funding sources must replace shrinking traditional banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">For securitisation to work in stimulating lending to the real economy, we need it to be simple and transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">This would reduce the post-crisis stigma associated with securitised products and would improve non-bank investors’ confidence in securitisations leading to higher demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">In turn this would free-up bank capital and allow banks to expand their own lending to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Capital Markets Union Finally, let me briefly touch upon a very recent initiative in Europe also aimed at improving financing of the real economy by broadening access to non-bank funding sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This initiative follows the fashionable title of Capital Markets Union or CMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Its objectives are very broad and the benefits may only materialise over the long-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">However, in a recently published Green Paper, the European Commission has highlighted a number of reforms which can improve enterprises’ funding access also in the short-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">For example, lowering barriers to capital market access as well as the development of a European private placement market can make a difference in providing finance to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The shift in financing of the real economy from the banking system to markets and non-bank entities is already taking place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">The role of CMU is to foster the effective and efficient allocation of financial resources at the European level while avoiding the vulnerabilities experienced during the recent episodes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">As I said before, it is important to finalise these initiatives to address all the lessons we learned from the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.33,0)">The current – indeed difficult – environment is the result of the crisis and the pre-crisis regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">In order to leave this transitory environment and move into a new and more resilient steady state for the good of the financial sector, we need to complete the regulatory reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Ultimately, this will have a positive effect on the real economy and lead to more sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Missing Elements: What about the rest of the system We had to make the banking system safer and I believe that, subject to the successful implementation of the measures discussed in the previous section, we are close to achieving this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">But does this make the financial system as a whole less crisis-prone and more conducive to sustainable economic growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.19,0)">Have we eliminated the market failures that make financial crises so costly for the real economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">So far, the regulatory reform has largely focused on the banking sector with the effect of pushing activities to less regulated and supervised parts of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Going forward, we need more information, and need to develop a monitoring framework and macro-prudential tools for the rest of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.72,0)">Non-banks can also exert costs on the wider financial system and can, just as easily as normal banks, become excessively risky and too-big-to-fail  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Our regulatory framework must evolve in two key aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">First, we need to have in place permanent tools for the more systemic players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Second, we need a toolbox for the less significant financial firms who could jointly destabilise the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This essentially mirrors the macro-prudential approach that we have followed for the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Identifying Systemic Non-Bank Non-Insurers In this respect, the current work of the FSB on a methodology for identifying Systemic Non-Bank Non-Insurers, in my view, addresses the first aspect of the remaining challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In this regard, let me highlight the importance of developing a framework that captures a wide-set of entities with this methodology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This is necessary for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">First, it sends a signal to the industry that authorities stand ready to apply macro-prudential tools when systemic risks are identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Second, we need to have a broad set of policy tools ready to address the risks stemming from financial firms at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.34,0)">Focusing on a limited set of entities will not allow us to fully understand what instruments are needed in our toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Going beyond systemic financial firms, it is necessary to develop appropriate macro-prudential tools to address the systemic risk of the remaining non-bank financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This is in the spirit of what has been done for the banking sector, where a range of policy tools is now available to address risks to banks from developments in specific markets and activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The FSB’s work on asset management goes in this direction and shows the road ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">The build-up of leverage and the growing exposure to illiquid assets in the asset management sector are clearly relevant developments for macro-prudential supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">These need to be carefully monitored and assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.09,0)">However, macro-prudential policy cannot stop at this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.39,0)">It is well-known that the liabilities of asset managers are subject to short-term redemption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Moreover, some asset managers hold a significant share of their assets in illiquid securities and use derivatives and short-term financing transactions to increase leverage and returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.23,0)">The combination of these factors makes asset managers more prone to runs and asset fire-sales, which may spill-over to other parts of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">A comprehensive toolkit to target these risks is therefore needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">More specifically, additional liquidity requirements and minimum redemption and load fees  are potential tools that should be part of the macro-prudential toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Haircuts for Secured Financial Transactions   and margin requirements for OTC derivatives Haircuts for securities financing transactions are a further tool that could prove to be effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">With countercyclical haircuts, as opposed to a regime with flat minimum requirements, the effects on volatility and leverage in financial markets may turn out to be stronger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Authorities should therefore consider using haircuts as a macro-prudential tool, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">by raising the numerical haircut floors and varying them over time in a countercyclical manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Macro-prudential haircuts for SFTs could be complemented by similar tools that allow authorities to set countercyclical add-ons to margin requirements applied by CCPs, as well as for OTC derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">I would encourage further work to understand the effects of these tools and how to apply them in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Concluding Remarks To kick-start growth in Europe is one of the most important challenges at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">I believe that the enhanced regulatory framework in place since the crisis can play a positive role in achieving this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">We want a healthy and competitive financial system that supports sustainable long-term economic development rather than a return to deregulation and boom-bust cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">As I have discussed, we still have to finish various initiatives, some of which are well under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">I expect these initiatives to help foster an environment of stable and healthy real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Challenges remain, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">In view of the global problem posed by ageing populations, growth may not necessarily pick-up without further structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.49,0)">Low interest rates brought about by secular stagnation further complicate the tasks of both monetary policy and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">A strong regulatory framework is essential in dealing with these challenges and avoiding future financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">However, an effective regulatory framework requires continued vigilance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">We are currently experiencing a significant shift away from bank intermediated finance and this process will continue in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This requires a broadened toolkit, the ability to take decisive and intrusive macro-prudential policy actions as well as a framework that is capable of expanding, in order to encompass all relevant systemic institutions and activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This becomes even more critical when monetary policy needs to be accommodative, as I expect will be the case for the foreseeable future in the euro area.</span>
