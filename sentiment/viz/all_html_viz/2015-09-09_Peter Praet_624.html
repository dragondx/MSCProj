    <span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)"> The ECB’s asset purchase programme: the impact so far Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Eurofi conference in Luxembourg,9 September 2015 The ECB’s expanded asset purchase programme has met with our initial expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">First of all, it has strongly signalled the ECB’s commitment to deliver its medium-term price stability objective, which has in turn been reflected in an upward shift in inflation expectations at all horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.95,0)">In keeping with this, any second round effects on inflation from the steep drop in oil prices last year appear to have been forestalled, and the tightening of medium-term real rates we saw towards the end of last year has been reversed  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">More generally, the signalling effect of the APP has been visible in solidifying business and consumer confidence underpinning a broadening economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The expanded APP, together with our credit easing package launched in summer 2014, has also had a positive impact on both market and bank credit dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.45,0)">The cost of market-based debt fell to historically low levels in the early part of 2015, and though it has risen in recent months, financing flows have remained robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">This implies a “first order” monetary policy effect from our interventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The credit easing package and expanded APP has been effective too in reducing wholesale funding costs for banks, allowing banks to pass on better funding conditions to their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.56,0)">Since summer last year the average cost of borrowing for euro area non-financial corporations has fallen by around 70 bps, and by 90 bps and 110 bps for NFCs in Spain and Italy, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The latest evidence from the July Bank Lending Survey confirms the improvement in credit conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">During the second quarter of 2015 credit standards continued to ease for firms, and even more so for households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Reflecting the endogenous relationship between credit supply and demand, credit demand also increased among both groups driven mostly by the low level of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The impact of the expanded APP on bank funding costs has been partially reversed by the recent market repricing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Here, however, the credit easing package and our broader asset purchases could act as complements, in particular the Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.75,0)">For the APP, the ECB defines the volume of liquidity it would like to inject, but cannot determine the price; for TLTROs, we define the price of the liquidity, but banks determine the volume.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">One tool can therefore act as an automatic stabiliser for the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Indeed, as wholesale funding costs for banks have risen, so has the attractiveness of the TLTRO.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This substitution effect accounts in particular for the higher participation in the fourth operation by banks in less vulnerable countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.7,0)">Some observers have voiced concerns that the APP could in fact negatively affect bank lending by squeezing margins and hence banks’ profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.51,0)">I do not share this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">ECB staff estimates of the impact of the APP show the overall effect on bank capital to be positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Capital gains on securities held, lower funding costs, improved credit quality and higher intermediation volumes outweigh the negative impact of the flattening of the term structure on net interest income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.86,0)">Though structural problems certainly remain in the euro area banking sector, banks’ weak profitability is to a large extent linked to the macroeconomic environment – something that the successful implementation of our programme will help address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In sum, the expanded APP, combined with our other credit easing measures, is largely producing its desired effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">We judge that the recent volatility in financial markets has not materially affected this picture, although close monitoring and continuous assessment are warranted from a monetary policy perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">It is nonetheless clear that the effectiveness of the APP would be enhanced by complementary measures from other policymakers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In particular, the improving economic and financial environment provides the ideal conditions for governments to press ahead with structural reforms, which are in turn necessary to make the recovery lasting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Raising expectations of future growth is vital to lift animal spirits and encourage a stronger rebound in investment, which is the cornerstone of a self-sustaining economic recovery.</span>
