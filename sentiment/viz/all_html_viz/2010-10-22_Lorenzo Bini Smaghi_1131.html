    <span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)"> Demographic trends, technological progress and economic growth in advanced economies Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, 66° Congresso Nazionale di Pediatria  , Rome, 22 October 2010 Introduction   First of all, I would like to thank the Società Italiana di Pediatria for inviting me to participate in its Annual Meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.29,0)">You are probably wondering what an economist is doing at a paediatricians’ meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.69,0)">To tell you the truth, I have been wondering about that too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me try to answer that question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In brief, this will be my line of argument, based on nine points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In a society characterised by limited demographic growth, technological progress is the main engine of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The main instrument for developing technology is human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.33,0)">The supply of skilled labour, which makes intensive use of human capital, is not keeping pace with the increase in demand, either in the United States or in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This explains why there is a strong correlation between the level of education and the probability of getting a well-paid job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.34,0)">Those who do not have access to education risk being marginalised and having a relatively low income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.07,0)">Over the past 25 years, the supply of education has not increased in line with demand, and this has generated a worldwide “excess demand” for high-level education, increasing competition and costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.99,0)">In other words, when it comes to gaining access to high-quality education, competition is now much fiercer than it was for the previous generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.38,0)">In advanced societies, the new generations are not prepared for the new competitive environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.49,0)">Such preparation occurs during the early years of an individual’s life  , when the personality and the cognitive abilities are shaped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.87,0)">Educational methods are largely responsible for this lag.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.97,0)">The natural tendency to apply the methods inherited from the previous generation is insufficient in the context of excess demand for high-quality education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">It is not easy to change educational methods, in respect of those we experienced ourselves, and to adapt them to the needs of a global society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It requires critical capacity and the ability to listen, powers which not many people have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But there is one important exception, to which I will return at the end of my remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I would like to develop each of these points in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Main drivers of growth: theory According to economic theory, growth is driven by developments in labour and capital and by developments in their productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.43,0)">Demographic trends affect economic growth via the effects related to the size and the structure of the population, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">mainly via changes in the number of persons of working age  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.45,0)">In turn, technological progress affects growth via the impact on labour and capital productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.72,0)">From a more analytical perspective, per capita income can be broken down into labour productivity  , demographic factors   and the employment rate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">If we compare some advanced economies, namely the euro area, the United States and the United Kingdom, and three emerging market economies, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Brazil, China and India, three main messages emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">First, productivity gains are the prime engine of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.92,0)">Second, productivity growth significantly slowed in the euro area after the mid-1990s, while it accelerated elsewhere  , particularly in emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Third, demographic developments made a sizeable contribution to growth in the emerging market economies, while this contribution was much smaller or even negative in advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In essence, these data show that fostering innovation is key, especially for those economies characterised by a shrinking share of working age population owing to ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This leads me to a brief analysis of some stylised facts on demographic developments in advanced and emerging market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I will then talk about technological progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Finally, I will discuss the importance of human capital accumulation and of education in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.8,0)">Some stylised facts on demographic developments… If we look at demographic developments in advanced economies such as Italy, the euro area  , the United Kingdom and the United States and compare them with those in selected emerging market economies such as Brazil, China and India, three significant differences emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">First, emerging market economies tend to have more young people  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.08,0)">In India almost one in three people were aged 14 or younger in 2008, while in Italy – which is among the countries with the lowest share of young people – the corresponding figure was only one in seven  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.23,0)">The slide also shows that the share of people aged 14 or younger has been declining in all these advanced and emerging market economies since 1985.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.41,0)">However, although this decline has been even stronger in the emerging market economies, these countries still have proportionately more young people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.14,0)">Second, the share of the working age population in advanced economies has remained either broadly stable or has declined over the past 25 years, while it has risen substantially in emerging market economies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In Brazil, for example, the share of the working age population rose by more than 8 percentage points between 1985 and 2008, while it declined by almost 1.7 percentage points in Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.96,0)">Third, the populations of many industrialised countries have been ageing, while those of Brazil, China and India have been getting younger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.38,0)">These diverse demographic developments – and the ageing of the population in particular – make it more difficult for many advanced economies to continue to grow and to remain competitive on world markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.58,0)">The problem has been exacerbated over the past 25 years, not least because many advanced economies have not acted quickly enough to address the ageing problem and its detrimental impact on economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">But competition from emerging market economies has not waited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Moreover, in many of these emerging economies, competitiveness has also been stimulated by investment in the technology sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me elaborate on this last point with the help of a few figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">…and on technological progress Ten years ago the EU Member States committed to transforming the EU by 2010 into “the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world  ”, as emphasised in the Lisbon strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">In order to achieve this aim, an explicit target was introduced whereby each country was to spend at least 3% of GDP on research and development   by the year 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.75,0)">The data clearly show that progress in this direction has in fact been very limited  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.56,0)">Among the largest four euro area countries, Italy ranks the lowest, and its level of R&D intensity has increased marginally since 1996.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">At the other end of the spectrum, China more than doubled its investment in R&D over the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The role of human capital Together with R&D, the economy’s ability to innovate crucially depends on human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Human capital is a broad concept, covering a set of skills which are acquired through education, as well as via on-the-job training and experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.07,0)">Also, human capital is affected by health conditions, on which people’s cognitive abilities directly depend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The importance of human capital to economic growth has been demonstrated in a number of empirical analyses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Several studies show that more affluent economies are also richer in human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">For example, there is a clear positive relationship between the average years of schooling and per capita income in advanced economies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">In addition, a vast literature in the field of labour economics has provided evidence that a positive causal relationship – which is significant and robust – can be found between the years of formal schooling   and wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This evidence suggests that private, or so-called “Mincerian”  , returns on education are within an average range of 6.5% to 9%; this means that an additional year of formal schooling is associated with a 7.5% increase in wages on average over a working life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The evidence related to the rise in returns on education – together with that on the inequality of earnings – provides useful information on the supply and demand of skills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">In particular, these factors would suggest that while the relative demand for more educated workers has steadily increased in line with technological advances, the supply of highly skilled labour has not always kept pace with demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.9,0)">In other words, the rise in the premium associated with technical skills indicates a mismatch between the insufficient supply of education and growing labour market requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This hypothesis – which has recently been put forward by Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz in respect of the United States   – would in my view also apply to a number of European economies where high-quality education is in short supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">An analysis of educational wage differentials in selected EU countries reveals that Germany and Italy register the highest premium for those with tertiary education, indicating high excess demand for highly educated workers  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Educational attainment in the United States and selected EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.07,0)">Where do we stand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">All countries have experienced an overall improvement in the skill levels of their population: on average 79% of euro area citizens aged between 25 and 34 have at least completed upper secondary education; this proportion is 26 percentage points higher than among those aged between 55 and 64.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.33,0)">However, there are considerable disparities across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.58,0)">For instance, in Spain and Italy the percentage of young people with upper secondary education is still below the euro area average, and much lower than in Germany and France  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.36,0)">When looking at tertiary education, the performance of the Italian economy is significantly worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In addition, the quality of education is at least as important as the number of years of formal schooling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is usually measured by a number of indicators, including pupil-to- teacher ratios, the educational level of teachers, and students’ performance in internationally standardised tests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Interestingly, a number of international studies suggest that, with regard to explaining the impact of education on growth, the quality of schooling is more important than the quantity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.92,0)">Put simply, it is not only the time spent at school that matters; it is what you learn, how you learn it, and from whom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">More generally, recent research conducted by economists at the ECB suggests that improvements in the quality of labour have made a substantial positive contribution to labour productivity growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">In particular, those who have achieved at least degree-level education are, on average, more productive than those who have only primary education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Overall, despite the progress made, improving education – in both quantitative and qualitative terms – remains high on the policy agenda in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">In order to give you a sense of the relative importance assigned to education in advanced and emerging economies,   Finally, let me add that today’s young people in advanced economies face much tougher competition than those three decades ago; in particular, competition for access to top international universities appears to have increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The total number of students in science and engineering has been steadily increasing since the mid-1980s, and the rise has been most rapid over the past decade  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.95,0)">Looking at the breakdown between US and non-US citizens, we can see that in 1985 fewer than 30% of science and engineering students came from outside the United States, whereas in 2008 their share was close to 40%  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">A breakdown of doctorate students in the United States by country of origin reveals that the share of Chinese and Indian students has increased at an extraordinary rate, from 9% in 1997 to almost 15% in 2007-08  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Over the same period, the proportion of students from EU countries remained substantially below the proportion of Chinese and Indian students, and has changed only marginally, despite the increasing need in advanced economies for highly skilled labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.02,0)">Concluding remarks In industrialised countries, the generation now entering the labour market is, for the first time since the Second World War, facing worse conditions, on average, than those faced by the previous generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.62,0)">And there is a risk that the situation will be even worse for the subsequent generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.96,0)">If there is not a rapid reversal of this trend, our societies may face huge economic and social problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Reversing the trend will require decisive action at the level of both supply and demand of education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Public debate has largely focused on supply, which is certainly important and assigns responsibility for improving the quality of education to public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.45,0)">But too little attention is paid to demand, which is insufficient owing to a lack of awareness of the fact that, without an adequate education, an individual’s standard of living not only will not improve, but will inevitably decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.43,0)">Our societies are not sufficiently aware of the fact that those who are not adequately prepared to compete for a better education will be denied access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.51,0)">Acquiring human capital is not just essential, it is becoming increasingly difficult and expensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.9,0)">We are thus faced with the problem of how to prepare the young people of today, and future generations, for the challenges that lie ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In order to resolve this problem, there must be a greater understanding of learning processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Jean Piaget, the pioneer of the constructivist theory of knowledge, explained that learning progresses through the stages of sensory and motor skills and cognitive abilities, before resulting in an ability to assimilate formal instruction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.85,0)">A deficiency at any one stage can result in problems in the stages thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.46,0)">Without the appropriately developed cognitive skills, even intensive academic instruction and hours of private tuition do not succeed in making up for the gap accumulated in the previous learning stages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.3,0)">A child’s first years are his or her most formative ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.57,0)">From birth, children are filtering stimuli and learning how to interact with their surroundings and the people they are in contact with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Parents play a critical role in laying the foundations for their child’s education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.06,0)">They are most often a child’s first teachers: they pass on not only the fundamentals of education, but also teach the child how to learn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.45,0)">However, when educating their children, parents often rely on personal experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.05,0)">But the simple transmission of knowledge from parents to children is no longer sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.76,0)">Piaget wrote that “indeed, the aim of intellectual education is not to know how to repeat or to conserve ready-made truths.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.92,0)">It is in learning to gain the truth by oneself at the risk of losing time and of going through all the roundabout ways that are inherent in real activity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">He continued: “Education, for most people, means trying to lead the child to resemble the typical adult of his society…but for me and no one else, education means making creators...You have to make inventors, innovators – not conformists”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Parents must receive guidance on how to correctly adapt the education of their children to the new needs of society in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.5,0)">However, parents are often unwilling to accept outside interference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.33,0)">They will not be inclined to listen to anyone who tries to convince them that simply reproducing the systems and procedures that they themselves experienced – which, as I explained earlier, were probably sufficient in a world that differed from the one we are living in today, with an excess demand for high-quality education – is damaging for the cognitive growth of their children.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There is, however, one exception to this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Personal experience tells me that if there is someone that parents are prepared to listen to, someone in whom they place absolute faith, it is the paediatrician.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I don’t want to go into why this is, but it is a fact, a fact which you paediatricians have to take on board and which gives you considerable responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">On the other hand, the arguments that I have put forward up to now are well-known to you, as you will have experienced them yourselves during your education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.63,0)">The difficulty of gaining access to higher education, the growing competition and the correlation between education and quality of life are not new to you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Whether you like it or not, your role cannot be limited to the field of medicine because your actions have an impact on the development of economic systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Through your scientific work and your practice, you contribute every day to extending life and thus to the ageing of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.2,0)">The problem is that our advanced societies are not yet well-equipped to deal with these developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.37,0)">Those who pay the highest price may well be precisely those children that you help every day, who will not be adequately prepared to face the challenges that society has dropped on them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.4,0)">What, then, is the function of the paediatrician?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">My suggestion to you is to take advantage of the receptive ears that parents have for you, not only to give them the necessary medical advice, but also to help them to be parents in our modern society, a role which is much more important – and more difficult – than is often thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">I am sure that you are already doing so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.58,0)">Charts           “High school graduate wage premium” is based on the high school / eighth grade wage differential
