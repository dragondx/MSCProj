    <span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)"> Euro Star Event Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBon the occasion of the Euro Star Event at Eesti PankTallinn, 19 September 2010 Dear Governor Lipstok, Ladies and gentlemen, The introduction of the euro is a historic moment for any EU Member State, and the euro itself is also a historic achievement for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Indeed, the euro is one of the most tangible signs of the cohesion and mutual trust, among Europe's citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Since its introduction back in 1999, the depth of feeling generated by the euro has been remarkable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">A lot of the attention gained by the euro has been directed not only at the currency itself, but rather at the underlying strategic vision, of which it has become the symbol.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The forthcoming enlargement of the euro area to include Estonia demonstrates that the euro area is not a “closed shop”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Its doors are open to the EU Member State that fulfils the necessary preconditions in a sustainable manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">1 January 2011 will become a landmark in the history of Estonia, reflecting the long and challenging process of economic and monetary integration that has enabled Estonia to join the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The euro banknotes and coins are now an important and natural part of our daily lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And this will soon be the case for the people of Estonia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In preparing for the changeover, we have enjoyed excellent cooperation with Eesti Pank and the Estonian Government, working very closely also with the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">And this, I am sure, will make the introduction of the euro in Estonia a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Today, Eesti Pank and the European Central Bank are launching the Euro Campaign Estonia 2011, an extensive media campaign to help the people of Estonia to become acquainted with the euro banknotes and coins, the security features of the banknotes and the changeover modalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The campaign comprises TV advertisements, print publications, public relations activities, interactive applications for the internet and special support for the media.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In total, we have four TV spots that will be aired from November 2010 to mid-January 2011, and these form the backbone of our communications activities for the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The first TV spot sets the mood of the campaign and familiarises viewers with the appearance of the euro banknotes and shows the gates and bridges featured on the banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The gates symbolise the spirit of openness and cooperation in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">The bridges represent the very close relationship and cooperation between the people of Europe and between Europe and the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The other three spots are shorter and focus on the security features of the euro banknotes, in particular, the “feel-look-tilt” technique that people can easily use to check the authenticity of our banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">And I am pleased to be able to show you the four TV spots for the first time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Action!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Dear Governor Lipstok, Ladies and gentlemen, It is an honour for me to be here tonight to present you with the Euro Star.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Since the inception of the Euro notes and coins, this unique memento has been a gift signifying a warm welcome to the “Eurosystem family”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In a way, the very idea of the Euro Star reminds me of your Kõpu Lighthouse, the world’s oldest functioning lighthouse built in 1531.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Like a bright star, this lighthouse has safely guided the merchant fleets bringing prosperity to Estonia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">I believe that, in its own way, the euro will serve as a similar beacon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">It, therefore, gives me great pleasure to present the Euro Star to Governor Lipstok as a symbol of Eesti Pank joining the Eurosystem on 1 January 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">We all very much look forward to welcoming Estonia to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Tere tulemast, Eesti!</span>
