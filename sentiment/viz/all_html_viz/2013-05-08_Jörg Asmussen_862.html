    <span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)"> Exchange of views with the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament on financial assistance to Cyprus Introductory Statement by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,Brussels, 8 May 2013 Dear Madam Chair, Honourable Members of Parliament, Thank you for inviting me to this exchange of views on financial assistance to Cyprus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.93,0)">The substance of the decisions, and process of how they were taken, have been debated controversially – also in this House.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">I am therefore pleased to be given the opportunity to provide the ECB’s views and to participate in a public debate on this matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Initial conditions in Cyprus Before discussing the key elements of the EU/IMF adjustment programme, it is very important to understand how Cyprus got itself into such difficult situation in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.58,0)">Why were imbalances of such magnitude allowed to develop?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What made the nature of the challenges faced by Cyprus so exceptional?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">I find these essential questions that I hope we can address during our exchange of views today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me focus here on the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In the 2000s, the Cypriot economy evolved towards a rather unbalanced business model with an inordinate weight for the financial industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The country aimed to become leading provider of international banking services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Cypriot banks attracted large inflows of foreign deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">They expanded their balance sheets dramatically over recent years, both domestically and externally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The overall banking system represented more than 700% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.73,0)">In terms of employment, every third job was related to the financial and professional service sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">An active use of the relevant policy tools could – and indeed should – have curbed these unsustainable developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.54,0)">But prudential supervision was too weak and did not prevent the build-up of large financial sector imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Asset growth outpaced deposit inflows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.03,0)">Banks became increasingly exposed to funding vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">They tried to attract deposits by offering very high deposit rates – on average, nearly 2 percentage points higher than in the rest of the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.23,0)">Domestic credit expansion and imprudent lending practices fuelled a domestic property boom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">As the bubble burst, non-performing loans increased dramatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.39,0)">Moreover, Cypriot banks underwent sizeable losses following the Greek debt restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.41,0)">This further deteriorated the soundness of their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.04,0)">The lop-sided nature of the economic model was not confined to the banking sector alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.06,0)">At the same time, significant external and internal imbalances had built up – notably persistent current account deficits, significant losses in competitiveness, rising fiscal deficits and public debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.95,0)">All this left Cyprus in a weak position to tackle the problems of its banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.45,0)">And these problems appeared to be daunting – especially compared to the small size of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">The two largest banks, which account for half of the domestic banking sector, had prospective capital needs of close to EUR 8 billion – or 44% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This is what the independent due diligence exercise revealed in February 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">If the sovereign had shouldered these massive recapitalisation needs, debt would have risen to 145% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.56,0)">This would have critically endangered public debt sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.15,0)">At the same time, traditional ways of burden sharing by the private sector bank creditors were limited, given little junior debt outstanding in banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.92,0)">All this made the situation in Cyprus highly challenging and exceptional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">One needs to bear in mind the starting conditions when assessing the design of the EU/IMF programme, to which I will now turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Key elements of the EU/IMF programme Three key objectives guided the negotiations of the MoU: first, to reduce the risks posed by the financial sector; second, to preserve debt sustainability; and third, to restore the conditions for sustainable and balanced growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Combining these three objectives has proved to be a challenge, to say the least.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Not only did the programme have to strike the right balance between short-term financial stability concerns and long-term debt sustainability considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.51,0)">It also had to be framed within a political context which requires unanimous decisions in the Eurogroup and ESM decision making bodies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.1,0)">Due to these exceptional economic and political circumstances, programme negotiations dragged on for too long, and the situation of the banking sector became critical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.83,0)">This forced the ECB to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">The provision of Emergency Liquidity Assistance   by the national central bank is aimed at supporting solvent banks facing liquidity problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.03,0)">Without a credible recapitalisation perspective, the two largest and weakest Cypriot banks could not have been considered solvent any longer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.89,0)">Further providing ELA to these banks would not have been in line with the rules of the Eurosystem and, ultimately, with the Treaty provisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Therefore, the ECB decided on 21 March that ELA would be continued if and only if a programme was in place that would ensure the solvency of the banks concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">After the Eurogroup agreement on 25 March, the ECB did not object to the request for the provision of ELA by the Central Bank of Cyprus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">On both occasions, the ECB acted strictly in line with its Statute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">It implemented the existing rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Nothing more, nothing less.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The finally agreed EU/IMF programme reflects the three objectives I mentioned earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In particular, it was decided to cover the capital needs of the two largest banks exclusively through the own contributions of uninsured depositors and senior and junior debt holders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.9,0)">The creditors of the two banks would not be made worse-off than they would have been in the case of liquidation, which would have been the alternative to the programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is necessary to guarantee the sustainability of public debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">It will also contribute to restoring the conditions for sustainable and balanced growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.15,0)">In addition, the EU/IMF programme foresees a rapid and substantial downsizing of the domestic banking sector, from about 550% to about 350% of GDP at the beginning of the programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">This is indispensable to reduce future contingent liabilities from the banks to the sovereign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">The EU/IMF programme also foresees the full protection of deposits below 100,000 euros which will not suffer any loss from the resolution strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Despite the unprecedented steps taken so far, the banking sector has not yet been stabilised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.59,0)">The burden sharing arrangement negatively affected depositor confidence and required the introduction of temporary and proportionate capital controls and restrictions on deposit withdrawals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.03,0)">Short term risks are high, as the deep recession is expected to take a toll on banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The reliance of the largest bank on ELA continues to be exceptionally high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Hence, firm steps are needed to complete the financial sector reform so as to rebuild confidence in the viability of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Let me now turn to the lessons which we can draw from the experience in Cyprus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Lessons from the Cypriot experience The Cypriot case has been a salutary reminder of the importance of establishing banking union as swiftly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Only then we will be able to break the negative interaction between sovereigns and their banking systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">First, it has shown that the speedy entry into force and implementation of the single supervisory mechanism   is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The centralisation of supervision as well as the effective use of macroprudential tools should help identify and prevent the persistent accumulation of financial imbalances at an early stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">This will help ensure a more resilient and viable financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">A financial sector that is capable of contributing to sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Second, it has demonstrated that we urgently need a European framework for the resolution of financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This should include a clear set of commonly known ex ante rules for bail-in, buffers of ‘bail-inable’ assets and depositor preference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Regarding the latter, the new framework should place depositors at the top of the creditor hierarchy and ensure that the role of DGS in resolution is limited to insuring eligible depositors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">This will contribute to reducing the risks to financial stability by providing legal certainty and predictability to resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Third, it has revealed the pressing need to establish a single resolution mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The SRM is a fundamental pillar of the banking union and is a necessary complement to the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">This requires a strong authority at its centre which should provide timely and impartial decision-making which minimises the costs of resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">The SRM should have a European resolution fund at its disposal which should have access to a temporary and fiscally neutral public backstop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I thank you for your attention and stand at your disposal for questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.75,0)">The rate for term deposits from households and non-financial corporations as of March 2013 was 4.4% in Cyprus and 2,5% in the euro area.</span>
