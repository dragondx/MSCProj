    <h3> Speaker: Lorenzo Bini Smaghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)"> Economic forecasting and monetary policy Speech by Lorenzo Bini SmaghiMember of the Executive Board of the European Central BankKeynote speechDIW 1925 – 2005 conferenceBerlin, 8 December 2005 Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to speak at this conference today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The DIW is the largest and oldest economics institute in Germany and conducts research in many fields of economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Speaking in a research institute, I feel stimulated to address a few analytical issues, raising questions rather than providing answers, and without necessarily limiting the reasoning to predefined frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.4,0)">The conduct of monetary policy faces challenges which are quite similar to those of economic forecasting, with some additional complications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.22,0)">As Niels Bohr, a Nobel laureate in Physics, used to say: “making predictions is very difficult, especially about the future.” I would add: “not only about the future”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.63,0)">Forecasting the direction in which the economy is going is essential for monetary policy, but not sufficient as knowledge about the starting position, and possibly even the past trajectory is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.45,0)">This is less simple than one would think, because some key variables are not observable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In my remarks today, I will try to explain why forecasts are so important for central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I will also make a digression on some   questions in monetary policy making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.59,0)">I will then examine how forecast errors may affect the monetary policy decision making and how the assessment of risks is at least as important as the central scenario of the forecast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A few basic concepts in monetary policy analysis… I would like to start by recalling a few basic concepts that I will use in my reasoning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.97,0)">Although these concepts have been well known in the literature, I have the impression that they might have been forgotten in more recent discussions about monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.51,0)">The first concept, quite well known for over 40 years now , is that monetary policy affects inflation and output with long and variable lags.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is well known to central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">A few years ago, the ECB and the national central banks set up a group of experts to study extensively these lags for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.16,0)">A conclusion which is shared by a large number of studies, not only on European but also on US data, is that monetary policy typically affects output   with a peak lag of about one year, and inflation with a lag of two years and more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.13,0)">These are average lags, measured over a sample period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.01,0)">The actual lags may be longer or shorter, depending on the particular combination of shocks affecting the economy at any point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.58,0)">In any case, what the analysis suggests is that a change in the monetary stance today has an impact on output roughly one year from now and on inflation one to two years from now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The implication for monetary policy is quite straightforward: policy should be based not only on current output and inflation developments, but   on expected future developments, one to two years ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">If one shares this generally recognised principle, one should also agree that a fair assessment about a given monetary policy stance cannot be made referring to the current state of the economy but rather on the basis of the expected state of the economy one or two years ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.55,0)">The rationale of a given stance or of a given monetary policy decision can be understood or criticized only on the basis of an economic forecast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.98,0)">It is interesting to note that most often the monetary policy stance is discussed in public on the basis of the current underlying conditions, in particular whether a given decision will “hurt” or “not hurt” the current recovery, ignoring the fact that monetary policy has very little if no impact at all on the economy for several months ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It is also interesting to note that some of the doubts expressed on recent monetary policy decisions were made against the background of much more optimistic forecasts of the euro area economy over the next 12 to 24 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Indeed, the most recent growth forecasts of the IMF, the OECD and the European Commission, over the 2006-2007 horizon all come out as somewhat more optimistic than the ECB staff forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.24,0)">The second concept is that any forecast of output and inflation is closely related to the assessment of the current economic conditions, in particular the cyclical position of the economy, which is called in the literature the “output gap”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.55,0)">An incorrect assessment of the underlying position of the economy in the cycle is likely to lead to a forecast error over the relevant forecasting horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The converse is also true: forecasts shape our view of current economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The reason is simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.95,0)">Most, if not all models we use to conceptualise macroeconomic behaviour make reference to long-term equilibrium conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These models require, de facto, an assessment of long-term equilibrium conditions in order to make consistent forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.01,0)">These assumptions thus “constrain” the dynamics of major variables and, for reasons of consistency, the starting position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.75,0)">Any error in the assessment of the long term equilibrium will be mirrored by a forecast error on growth and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.29,0)">The good news is that the forecast error might be smaller, the shorter the horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.0,0)">The bad news is that what is relevant for monetary policy is not so much the short term but the 1 to 2 years ahead forecast horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Just to give you a very concrete example of how the assessment of the level and the rate of change are related, let me mention the forecast that major institutions made in 2000 about the continuation of economic growth in the euro area, at a pace close to 3 per cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">On the basis of these forecasts, the cyclical position in 2000 was estimated to be close to potential output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.92,0)">As projections were drastically revised downwards in 2001 and in the following years, the estimate of the cyclical position in 2000 was also revised, and turned out to be quite above potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">What in 2000 looked like a situation of output close to potential, and consistent with a fast rate of growth of the economy, turned out to be a very large positive output gap ex post.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There is a nice box in the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin of February 2005 illustrating this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.38,0)">The difficulties in empirically estimating concepts such as the long term equilibrium level or the output gap suggest that one should not rely only on empirical models but also use a panoply of indicators to obtain plausible estimates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.13,0)">However, one should be aware that any adjustment, judgmental or of another nature, to any of these concepts has an impact also on the other variables of the model, if consistency is to be preserved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.61,0)">Furthermore, the difficulty in estimating these unobservable variables has called for not using them in the framework of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, for any monetary policy decision to be based on a consistent framework, it must at least implicitly make reference to some estimates of these unobservable variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The third concept is that the level of a variable is as important as its change or its rate of change, not only for forecasting but also for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What matters for monetary policy is not only the change in interest rates but also their level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Keeping interest rates unchanged is a policy decision in the same way as changing them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.49,0)">In fact, according to theoretical models,  the amount of monetary accommodation or restriction does not depend on the level of the interest rate itself but on the distance with respect to some measure of equilibrium rate, what is generally called the natural interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.0,0)">If the natural interest rate falls because of a negative shock to productivity  , but the prevailing interest rate remains constant, all other things being equal, monetary policy has become tighter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.51,0)">This makes things more complicated, because the natural rate of interest is not observable and very difficult to estimate in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">A related concept that one should derive from these models is that the stance of monetary policy should not be assessed on the basis of the level of the interest rate, but should take into account the underlying economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.79,0)">An unchanged interest rate can imply an unchanged policy as well as a tightening or a relaxation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.0,0)">It all depends on what happens to the variables affecting the economy at a given moment in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">For instance, an unchanged nominal interest rate, while inflationary pressures build up and/or economic growth picks up, implies a monetary expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">An unchanged interest rate in the face of lower inflationary pressures and fading growth implies instead a monetary tightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.34,0)">If this concept is applied in practice, it could easily be verified, for instance, that while the ECB reference rate remained at 2 per cent throughout the second half of 2005, the monetary stance had become more and more expansionary as projected HICP inflation and real GDP growth edged up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The academic and market literature has developed a whole series of indicators of monetary conditions that have become quite popular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.38,0)">These indicators have to be taken with a lot of caution, because they rely on estimates for variables, such as the natural interest rate and the output gap, which are unobservable, as well as on estimates of parameters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Nonetheless, their attempt at assessing something which is conceptually correct, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">that the stance of monetary policy does not depend only on the level of the nominal short-term interest rate, should be praised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.49,0)">The most popular of these indicators is the Taylor rule, which measures the stance of monetary policy in relation to a   natural interest rate, the   deviation of inflation from the target, and the   output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Despite its limitations which are well known, this measure makes it very clear that, for given level of the nominal interest rate, a change in the output and inflation outlook also changes the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Again, it is interesting to note that in recent months these indicators all pointed in the same direction in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.2,0)">..and few possible gaps I have referred so far to standard macro models that forecasters and policy-makers use, explicitly or implicitly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.84,0)">Let me now turn to some questions that available economic models might not fully answer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.84,0)">The simplest version of the macro model for policy analysis   is based on a linear-quadratic approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.49,0)">According to these models, the central bank typically minimises a quadratic loss function based on a linear description of economic behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The optimal policy of the central bank is derived as a linear relationship between the policy instrument   and a policy target  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.25,0)">In a context of uncertainty, the optimal targeting criterion is replaced by its best forecast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">These models have two important characteristics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.79,0)">First, any given level of the policy instrument corresponds to a specific level of income and inflation; the relationship between policy and outcomes is monotonic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Second, the optimal behaviour of the central bank under uncertainty is essentially the same as under perfect foresight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This is often called the “certainty equivalence” principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This analytical framework suggests that by controlling the interest rate, the central bank can set any level of the policy target, with a given time lag, barring unforeseen shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.12,0)">Accordingly, if output falls, following an unexpected shock, there is a defined level of the interest rate which brings output back to its original level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The central bank just has to know the appropriate level at which the interest rate should be set to get back the economy on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.16,0)">The problem with these linear models is that they do not allow for a full understanding of the risks of alternative interest rate policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For instance, standard macro-models suggest that, for a given exogenous shock that produces a negative output gap, the more liquidity is provided in the economy, the faster the recovery will be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.92,0)">An implication of this result would be that there are a priori no obvious reasons to set any lower bound to the reduction of the interest rate to face an economic slowdown, except for the zero bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">In recent years, however, we experienced, and to some extent still experience, both in Europe and in the US, long periods characterised by very low real interest rates that have not lead to stronger growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">How can this be reconciled with the predictions of the model?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">One view, which is consistent with the simple type of macro model I just sketched, would be that in the last few years the euro area economy experienced a sequence of negative shocks that have progressively widened the negative output gap, and counteracted the stimulating effect of the very low level of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.36,0)">Another possible interpretation, however, would be that when real interest rates are very low or negative for a very long time, the monetary policy transmission mechanism might change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.98,0)">Since there aren’t many historical episodes of a very accommodative policy stance on a lasting basis, we do not know enough of this type of situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In my view, this is an issue which deserves much greater attention than it has received so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Let me just point to some research which might suggest that further work in this area might be of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.55,0)">A recent book co-authored by Joe Stiglitz points to the fact that much of the mainstream monetary theory “assumes away” too much in terms of how financial markets work in reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.41,0)">In particular, when asymmetric information is pervasive in credit and financial markets, price mechanisms alone may not always clear markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.37,0)">While recent research in the economics of information has examined possible “pathological” effects of very high real interest rates, we do not seem to know enough about the impact of very low real interest rates for prolonged periods of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.81,0)">Recently, Ragu Rajan   developed some interesting considerations about the possible impact of prolonged very low real interest rates on economic efficiency, in particular investment, which could result from a general tendency to under-price risk in a context of asymmetric information between lenders and borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.18,0)">For instance, low rates of return might encourage reckless or speculative investment behaviour by pension fund and insurance managers  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Rajan's main argument, in short, is that investment may be more sensitive to current, rather than future expected, financing conditions due to the structure of incentives in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.91,0)">Therefore, agents do not discount the possible correction of liquidity conditions in their investment decisions, which may then turn out   to have been too risky and ultimately wasteful once the policy accommodation is removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.12,0)">Since there is significant irreversibility in investment, this phenomenon might have long-lasting consequences on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.04,0)">Another issue that is little examined in the literature is the impact of a given level of interest rate on the sectoral allocation of resources  and the resulting distortionary effects that can arise from a prolonged deviation from the natural rate, as a result of a very accommodative policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.01,0)">These are just examples of an infant literature, which needs to be fed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.16,0)">To sum up, available models may not be sophisticated enough to consider the effects of prolonged periods of very high liquidity as the one we have experienced in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">There are some reasons to believe that this is a relevant issue and that more research is warranted on this matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.73,0)">Optimizing monetary policy and minimizing policy errors According to standard macro models, inflation is a function of the deviation of aggregate demand from the economy’s output potential, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.13,0)">the output gap, and other exogenous shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In the absence of other shocks  , a central bank aiming at achieving price stability should calibrate the level of interest rate, as a deviation from its natural level, in relation to the forecasted output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The representation of such an optimal policy is often found to be consistent with the rule originally suggested by John Taylor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">An enormous literature has burgeoned on monetary policy reaction functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.01,0)">One policy recommendation from this literature is that the interest rate should be lower than its natural rate if the economy is below potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.23,0)">If the interest rate is not lower than the natural rate, monetary policy becomes tighter, which might aggravate the slack in the economy and generate deflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.94,0)">By how much interest rates should decrease depends on the expected gravity of the slowdown and on the particular nature of the shocks that affect the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.06,0)">Another policy recommendation is to take into account the lags in the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.56,0)">Since monetary policy may influence inflation with a lag of over 24 months, the interest rate response to shocks should be pre-emptive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Policy interest rates should ideally increase as soon as signs of inflationary pressures become apparent, and before inflation actually picks up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">If the economy is below potential, but growing at a rate higher than potential, so that the output gap is expected to fall over the next 12 to 24 months, the interest rate should be lower than the natural rate but increasing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To sum up, in a stylised framework the interest rate cycle should anticipate the economic cycle, by about 12 to 24 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">This means that interest rates should peak well ahead of the peak of the cycle and start rising well ahead of the trough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is what the theory suggests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It assumes that we are able to perfectly forecast the peak and the trough of the cycle and that we can estimate at each point in time the natural rate so as to set the optimal interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.87,0)">Real life is of course different, because many variables needed to implement optimal policy are unknown and difficult to measure or forecast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">On the other hand, there is no alternative to making the best possible effort to estimate these key parameters and variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Policy makers are fully aware of these complexities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This is why they use a multiplicity of techniques to minimise forecast errors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">First, more than one forecast model is generally used and the results are cross-checked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is the reason why our monetary policy strategy is based on two pillars, the economic analysis and the monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.93,0)">The monetary analysis can be associated to a reduced form longer-term forecast model of inflation,  and the economic analysis to a structural form short to medium term forecast model of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">It is well known that forecast combination is generally superior to individual forecasts, especially with the aim of minimising the risk of large errors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Judgement is also used in making the forecast, exploiting available indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This is particularly important for the assessment of the prevailing cyclical position of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Since economic relationships   change over time, the policy maker will always try to use a combination of models and expert judgement in making the forecast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Furthermore, any baseline forecast has to be accompanied by an analysis of risks surrounding the central scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is important because risks   are typically not symmetrically distributed, so they do not necessarily cancel out on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Moreover, a thorough discussion of the risks helps to better understand and to test the robustness of the assumptions underlying the central scenario of the forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.85,0)">Type I and Type II errors in monetary policy Let me try to explain how the difficulties in making forecasts are taken into account by policy makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I will focus on the most challenging task for monetary policy: turning points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">As I already mentioned, theory suggests that monetary easing should end well ahead of the trough, and the turning point should occur much before the economy starts growing at potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.91,0)">The pace of the tightening should depend on the strength of the expected recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.99,0)">In practice, things might be more complicated because there is a lot of uncertainty about when the economy reaches its trough and on the pace at which it is expected to recover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.41,0)">There is one additional problem: the uncertainty about the end point of the tightening phase, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">the so-called natural long-term level of the interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.83,0)">This problem is generally considered as not very relevant until the tightening phase is well advanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is not without some risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.32,0)">Indeed, if we agree with the standard model, according to which the degree of accommodation provided at any moment in time is not defined by the level of the interest rate itself but by the difference between that rate and its natural level, some assessment of the natural rate must be made, implicitly or explicitly, at any moment in time, including when deciding the timing of a turning point and the policy thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.94,0)">A wrong assessment of the natural rate may induce a wrong assessment of the degree of monetary accommodation prevailing at any moment in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.11,0)">For instance, if the natural interest rate level is lower than previously estimated, the distance between the prevailing rate and its natural level might be lower than thought and thus monetary policy may turn out to be less expansionary than initially thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.53,0)">Things are made more complex, from an analytical standpoint, also by the fact that the assessment of the natural rate and of the output gap are obviously interlinked, since the same underlying shocks drive both the natural rate and potential output growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.12,0)">Concerning the optimal timing of a turning point, the policy maker is faced with the possibility of making two sorts of mistakes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.99,0)">I will use an analogy with statistical hypothesis testing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.78,0)">Type I error is made in case the recovery takes place and inflationary pressures are building up, but this is not adequately forecasted in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is what policy makers would call “being behind the curve”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.29,0)">Type II error consists instead in forecasting a recovery that does not materialize as expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.99,0)">This would imply tightening too soon and being “ahead of the curve”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">A policy maker must seriously weigh the relative costs of type I rather than type II error.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is consistent with the view that the policy-maker acts as a “risk manager”, as suggested some time ago by the Chairman of the Fed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Hence, the policy-maker needs to have a view on the distribution of risks around the most likely outcome  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.42,0)">Type I error, being behind the curve, entails the risk of becoming more and more accommodative as the economy recovers, adding liquidity instead of withdrawing it and fuelling inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Type I error can eventually be corrected by increasing the speed of tightening down the road.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.34,0)">If there are uncertainties about the expected turning point in the cycle and the projected strength of the recovery, a policy maker might afford to wait for some time before starting to tighten and even risk being late, if there is room to catch up with a faster speed of tightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is what a standard model would suggest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.62,0)">However, this view – and this is an important point which I would like to underline and which is often not sufficiently considered – does not take into account the fact that as the tightening is delayed, the economy might accumulate large imbalances which render a sharp tightening more risky, in terms of economic and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">A well known example is the 1994 tightening in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.32,0)">This experience has shown in particular that an economy which is flooded with liquidity, following a persistent period with very low or even negative real rates of return, grows so accustomed to it that it discards any possibility of a return to normality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.46,0)">Hence, a removal of an extraordinary and prolonged degree of accommodation might have to take place at a very gradual pace and has to be well communicated to economic agents, so that they can reduce in a smooth way their overall excess liquidity position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.5,0)">The main message is that the cost of type I error increases the larger are the liquidity imbalances accumulated during the easing phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.93,0)">Type I error can be reduced if the economy is in a situation in which there is as little excess liquidity as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In this case, the cost of taking time and waiting for data to confirm that the economy is indeed strengthening would not come on top of already existing distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Finally, type I error is less costly   if the central bank is very credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">If agents know that the central bank is committed to maintain price stability over the medium term, they can tolerate type I error for some time as the increase in inflation expectation remains contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.16,0)">However, a central bank cannot rely too much on its acquired credibility and must monitor very closely long-term inflation expectations imbedded in market instruments to avoid remaining for too long behind the curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.86,0)">If markets start doubting about the anti inflationary stance of the central bank, inflation expectations might increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.47,0)">Reining them back may require a much larger increase in interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The cost of a type I error would thus increase dramatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.07,0)">Let me turn now to type II error, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.95,0)">tightening too early.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.62,0)">The cost of such an error is to put an excessive break on the economy, which might not be as strong as initially expected, thus slowing down, and possibly even stopping the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.52,0)">This could even lead to a policy reversal, as interest rates would have to be reduced again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.6,0)">Reversing gear might create a reputation risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.76,0)">The central bank might also be accused of having delayed the recovery, which could undermine its independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The cost of a type II error can be reduced if at the start of the tightening the economy benefits of very ample liquidity, following the persistence of very low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">To sum up, the existence of very ample liquidity in the economy raises the cost of type I errors and reduces the cost of type II errors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The cost of the type II errors can be further minimised if the interest rate rise is seen as a return to a level more consistent with adequate liquidity conditions rather than the start of a tightening cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.02,0)">The relative costs of type I and type II errors are always considered by central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me give a few examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Between 2002 and 2004, the forecast of all major institutions   pointed to accelerating economic growth in the euro area over the following two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.55,0)">A mechanistic policy response would have induced an upward adjustment in interest rates and the start of a tightening cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This did not occur because the downward risks to the recovery were heavily taken into account in the decision making process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The risk of making a type II error was seriously considered while the cost of taking time to wait for more solid signs before tightening were considered as being relatively small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Ex post, this turned out to be the right decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">At the end of 2005 the balance of risks changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">After over two years of very low, and partly negative real rates, the cost of type I error increased substantially, because of the large liquidity accumulated in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.89,0)">There were signs of substantial distortions in the allocation of resources in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.69,0)">The very high growth rate of mortgage credit and of property prices in euro area countries can be seen as a reflection of such distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">At a global level, a high degree of risk appetite has developed in financial markets, as reflected for example in high money and credit growth, low bond yields, rising equity and property prices, and low corporate bond spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.46,0)">Under these circumstances, waiting further, taking time to have stronger data on economic activity would have entailed a further rise in the degree of accommodation and possibly of the distortions in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.58,0)">The cost of type I errors would have increased excessively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The cost of a possible type II error was considered to be lower due to the ample liquidity available in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Market participants fully perceived that the adjustment in interest rates aimed primarily at withdrawing part of the excess liquidity in the system rather than a starting a typical tightening cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.62,0)">It is clear that the costs of alternative errors may change over time, depending on the projected economic developments and on the imbalances accumulated in the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">These costs are continuously assessed by the policy makers, with a view to minimise them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">A good diet is the best prevention Since monetary policy is forward looking, it is sometimes depicted as part of a prevention strategy, which is better than a cure at a later stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.95,0)">The analogy is quite suggestive but may not take fully into account the complexity of monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Indeed, vaccination prevents fever, but vaccination has to take place at the right time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It should happen neither too late nor too early, especially if the body is still weak and maybe under antibiotics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.75,0)">If vaccination is given while one still is under antibiotics, the body may weaken further, especially if antibiotics have been taken for a long time, maybe too long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.48,0)">The right sequence thus foresees that first the antibiotics cure is stopped and only after a while can the vaccination be given.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.57,0)">One way of characterizing the 1 December decision might be that it is part of a phase in which the euro area stops taking antibiotics, which it has absorbed for too long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">We haven’t come yet to the full treatment of vaccines to prevent influenza  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The body might need to get stronger before getting the shot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In any case, I must admit that I have some doubts that the analogy with medicine is the most appropriate one for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Doctors are generally considered by their patients as saviours, capable of healing any illness and being able to provide special medicines that can push the human body even beyond realistic performance, especially for athletes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.11,0)">That’s not the way monetary policy works nor should work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Monetary policy is nether a medicine, nor a drug, that can ensure that the economy is always at full potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I see central banks more as dieticians, who aim at calibrating the amount of calories as a function of the athlete’s activity and performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.11,0)">When the athlete is in good shape and trains for a competition, the amount of calories burned by his body increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.87,0)">If the dietician underestimates the amount of calories that the athlete needs and prescribes an insufficient amount, the muscles do not develop sufficiently and he will not perform well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.01,0)">This is type II error.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.72,0)">If instead the dietician overestimates the amounts of calories, the athlete will eat too much and will accumulate too much fat in his body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.5,0)">This will also lead him to underperform the day of the competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.84,0)">This is type I error.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.98,0)">If the athlete is not in good shape, for instance because of an injury, giving him more calories will not make him better off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.69,0)">He is most likely to get fatter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.87,0)">The fatter he gets the more he will have to train, at the end of his injury period, in order to get back on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As a dietician can only aim over time at minimizing the percentage of fat in a body, monetary policy can only aim at calibrating the amount of liquidity necessary to the economy to develop without inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.27,0)">Too much or too little liquidity are both bad for the economy as well as too many or too little calories are bad for a body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">But liquidity, like calories, cannot by itself systematically increase the performance of the economy over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">It can be improved only through structural reforms that raise growth potential, as much as an athlete can only improve his performance through training.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.11,0)">The comparison with dieticians may not sound very glorious for central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.6,0)">However, it matches well the school of thought according to which monetary policy has overall little impact on economic developments, except when major mistakes are made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This is why central banks should aim primarily at avoiding major policy errors rather than trying to fine tune the economy towards an optimal path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.5,0)">I tend to belong to this school of thought.</span><span style="background-color:
