    <span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)"> Sabine Lautenschläger: 100 years of women’s suffrage – gender equality, freedom and democracy Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at an event marking the run-up to the centenary of women’s suffrage in Berlin, 26 July 2017 “What we don’t want and what we’re not aiming for, never, not even centuries from now, is political emancipation and equality for women.” Of course, these aren’t my words.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.26,0)">They were written in 1866 by Adolf Lette, a politician.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">They are very revealing as Lette was the founder of an association with a very specific objective – to promote the “employment of women”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">To a certain extent therefore, Lette was an advocate of gender equality – for that day and age.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">His general opposition to gender equality, however, was unsuccessful: next year we are celebrating 100 years of women’s suffrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Giving women the vote was a crucial step towards greater gender equality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.13,0)">For if you cannot vote, you have no political voice and, without that, your concerns cannot be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But the right to vote was only the first step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It was the first step on a journey which then took place at a rather leisurely pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.18,0)">It took until 1949 and Germany’s Basic Law, which explicitly stated that women and men were equal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.2,0)">And until 1977 for the legal concept of “stay-at-home” wives to be dropped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.13,0)">Only since then have women been able to go to work without their husband’s permission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.03,0)">Do you find that as shocking as I do?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.65,0)">Just think: we are not talking about something back in the mists of time; this is only 40 years ago!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">It’s a good thing that we are shocked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Because it shows how self-evident gender equality has become for us, especially for young people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.84,0)">But is it really so self-evident?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There’s no doubt that access to education and training no longer depends on gender.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">In terms of school-leaving qualifications and university degrees, women are even slightly ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.32,0)">It’s not until later that things get difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Only after they embark on a career do young women notice that equality does not extend as far as they thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Although they started out on the same conditions as their male colleagues, they have to overcome higher barriers on their career path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.34,0)">Often they earn less than their male colleagues even if they are just as qualified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.47,0)">They bump into the famous glass ceiling when they want to forge a career.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And, above all, it is they who have to combine family and career – not the men.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.8,0)">Usually it’s the women who take parental leave, and usually it’s the women who take part-time work afterwards and who don’t progress so far career-wise as their husbands and colleagues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.88,0)">My impression is that many women see these matters as personal problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.32,0)">They are that, of course, but they are more than that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.06,0)">They concern all women and the whole of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">And the situation will only change when we all expand our personal horizons and push for wholesale gender equality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">So my appeal to all young women is: don’t take gender equality for granted!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Be pro-active!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Stand up for your rights and the rights of others!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.86,0)">The issue of equality is far from resolved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And by the way, equality is of course not only a matter for women themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.24,0)">Why should it only be an issue for women to combine children and a career?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.74,0)">Where are the men, where are the fathers?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.96,0)">I sometimes have the feeling that, despite all the progress, certain traditional roles are entrenched in people’s heads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.35,0)">And this applies not only to men but also to us women.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We too are receptive to stereotypes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.95,0)">Studies show that women, just like men, unconsciously discriminate according to sex – also in the workplace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">What we need is a change of culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.05,0)">And the starting point for that is to call into question not only the behaviour of others, but also our own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This is an important step which is often neglected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">So it’s up to all of us to ensure greater gender equality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">But politicians can help too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">For example, they can improve the conditions under which women – or men – combine career and family.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.07,0)">And then there are employment practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Employers should not only use equality as a recruitment tool; they must also make equality possible in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">That could be done, for example, with more flexible working hours; employees should have greater freedom to allocate their time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.01,0)">Why not pick up the children from school in the afternoon and then go back to your desk again in the evening?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.28,0)">Consider Sweden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.4,0)">There it’s good form not to organise meetings after 4 p.m.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">So we can learn something if we only look around a little.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Gender equality has many facets, and I have touched upon several.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Generally speaking, there are three things which, for me, are inseparably linked to this issue: First, equality doesn’t only mean rights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">For every right there is an obligation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Therefore, having the same rights means having the same obligations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.77,0)">It’s not just about cherry-picking, if I can put it like that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Women who demand complete gender equality must also be ready to take on responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Second, gender equality doesn’t only concern a career-minded elite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.86,0)">It concerns everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.98,0)">So it’s not just about female quotas for supervisory boards and executive boards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.96,0)">It’s not just about gender-neutral phrasing in legal texts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.34,0)">All that is of relatively little benefit to most women.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">For the majority it must mean more flexible working hours, respectful treatment, appropriate pay, better child care – just to mention a few things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Third, equality ultimately concerns one thing: freedom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Every individual should live exactly how she or he wants to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">That also means we have to be tolerant of different lifestyles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.4,0)">We have to be tolerant of women   who see being at home with the family as a calling; we have to be tolerant of women who see a career as a calling; and we have to be tolerant of women who claim both for themselves: family and career.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And tolerance isn’t the whole story: women with different lifestyles should display solidarity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.63,0)">They should never let themselves make comments like “she’s only a housewife” or “she neglected her children for her career”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Despite all this, there’s one point we should put on record: basically it’s a good sign for us in Germany that, when it comes to gender equality, the discussion is usually, though not always, about careers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">It means that in other areas we have evidently come a long way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">To realise that, it’s enough just to look at other countries – in Africa, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">There are areas where women live in terrible conditions – Adolf Lette would still be a progressive reformer there today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">We must therefore not only look beyond our personal horizons but also beyond our national horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.37,0)">From a global perspective, the issue of gender equality has quite a different meaning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Nevertheless, gender equality is also making progress at a global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.37,0)">For instance, the World Economic Forum’s Global Gender Gap Report covers the whole world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It measures the gaps in a number of areas, including the economy, education and politics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.47,0)">It reports that, if current trends continue, the global gender gap could be closed in 83 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Girls born now would be on an equal footing at the end of their lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.97,0)">There are, of course, enormous regional differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The World Economic Forum estimates that in eastern Europe and central Asia it will take almost 150 years to achieve full gender equality; in the Middle East and north Africa almost 130 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">At least by comparison, western Europe is doing quite well: only 61 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In my view, however, that’s not praise – far from it – but rather a reminder to progress more quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">We are celebrating 100 years of women’s suffrage in Germany next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It’s about equality, but it’s also about democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.65,0)">For if half the population is economically dependent and not allowed to vote, then there is no democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.14,0)">It’s all the more alarming if parts of the political spectrum are still – or perhaps again – apparently propagating an image of women that is outdated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.68,0)">Whoever does that is also trying to undermine democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">To put it another way, if you fight for equality, you also fight for democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.69,0)">Alas, today that seems to be becoming ever more necessary.</span>
