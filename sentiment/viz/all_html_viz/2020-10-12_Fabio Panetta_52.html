    <span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)"> A digital euro for the digital era Introductory statement by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ECON Committee of the European Parliament Frankfurt am Main, 12 October 2020 Madame Chair, honourable members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Thank you for inviting me to present the Eurosystem report on a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The quest to ensure that means of payment are fit for purpose has characterised economic history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In the provision of money by the sovereign, Europe can boast of a primacy dating back to ancient Greece  and the Roman era.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The search for sound money continued in the “dark” years of the High Middle Ages, despite the resumption of bartering; in the eighth century the monetary reform of Charlemagne spread out in many European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The evolution of money over the centuries and across different regions has reflected changes in economic life, in technology, and in societal beliefs and behaviours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">When Marco Polo visited China in the 13th century, he was shocked to discover paper money, which we now know had already been used there for centuries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">He called its creator a perfect “alchemist”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Today, digitalisation is spreading to all areas of our life, including the way we pay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">So I do not expect anyone to find the idea of a digital currency as astonishing as Marco Polo found the idea of paper money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Nowadays, central banks are entrusted with the fundamental task of providing citizens with costless access to simple, secure and risk-free means of payment that can be used on a large scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Delivering on this task requires central banks to analyse relevant developments in society and adapt accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">In order to be able to give Europeans easy access to a safe form of central bank money in a society that is moving increasingly quickly towards digital payments, the ECB’s Governing Council has decided to advance work on the possible issuance of a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Should the need arise, we want to be ready to introduce a digital euro: a form of central bank money that would complement cash, not replace it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Together, these two types of money would be accessible to all, offering greater choice and easier access to ways of paying.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">After publishing our report on a digital euro on 2 October, we are now in a phase of listening and experimentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Our exchange today is a key step in this phase and marks the launch of the ECB’s public consultation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.57,0)">I will come back to this consultation in a moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But first I will outline the characteristics of a digital euro, as well as the advantages and the challenges it could present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I will also discuss some scenarios that could require the ECB to issue a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.73,0)">What is a digital euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We already have an array of choices when it comes to retail payments: central bank money in the form of cash, commercial bank money – for example, digital bank deposits – and non-bank digital money  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">What we do not have is a digital currency that is issued by the central bank and that we can use for all our daily transactions, including in e-commerce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">A digital euro would fill this gap: it would be an electronic form of central bank money accessible to all citizens and firms – in other words, a digital equivalent of euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">It would provide costless access to a simple, risk-free and trusted digital means of payment, accepted throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In the digital era, it would preserve the public good that the euro provides to European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Compared with existing means of digital payments, a digital euro would provide added value in several ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">First of all, it could be used for payments anywhere, by anyone and at any time – just like cash in the physical world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Second, it would bring simplicity: a digital euro should be designed to be easy to understand, easy to use and easy to transfer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Regardless of its features or the technology it would be based on, people from all groups in society should be able to use it in their daily lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This is because making a payment is about more than just exchanging money for goods and services: it is a form of social interaction made possible by money, which has been described as “the most universal and most efficient system of mutual trust ever devised” .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Finally, a digital euro would increase privacy in digital payments thanks to the involvement of the central bank, which – unlike private suppliers of payment services – has no commercial interests related to consumer data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Ensuring privacy is an essential element of modern democracies and part of our European values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Payments must also respect people’s right to privacy in the digital era, and the design of a digital euro would have to respect this principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">This is a core aspect we will look at – indeed, we have already started exploring possible ways of enhancing privacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.46,0)">At the same time, payments in a digital euro – just like any form of payment – would have to respect the rules on countering money laundering, the financing of terrorism and tax evasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">This would enable public authorities to combat any illegal activity more effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">To summarise, the digital euro would still be a euro, only in digital form.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">It would both shape and promote the digitalisation of payments, while reducing the associated risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This would in turn support the ongoing digitalisation and modernisation of the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.79,0)">Why might we need a digital euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">A digital euro would be critically important in a number of scenarios, which are analysed in our report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.44,0)">In particular, it would be needed in the event that citizens become reluctant to use cash as they go digital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.79,0)">This is not the situation we face today: cash is still the most common way of making retail payments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.79,0)">However, its role as a payment instrument is diminishing – in some countries rapidly so – as consumers are increasingly paying electronically:  as a proportion of all physical retail payments, cash payments decreased from 79% in 2016 to 73% in 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">This trend has accelerated during the pandemic – with a vast majority of consumers expecting to continue using digital payments as often as they do now, or even to use them more often in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">And because of this trend, we may see a further increase in the uptake of international card schemes and solutions such as payment wallets and apps developed by large technology firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">A digital euro would ensure that even in a situation where there is rapid digitalisation in the world of payments, sovereign money remains at the core of the European payment system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">This would contribute to financial inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It would also shield us from the risk that a private or public digital means of payment issued and controlled from outside the euro area could largely displace existing domestic means of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.24,0)">Such a development would raise regulatory and financial stability concerns and could even put Europe’s monetary and financial sovereignty at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.54,0)">How could a digital euro be introduced?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">Legal considerations and possible challenges A digital euro would raise legal, technological and policy questions that we need to address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me start with the legal basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.48,0)">Today, only euro banknotes and coins are legal tender under EU primary law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This means they can be used to pay anywhere in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Therefore, a key issue discussed in the report is the importance for a digital euro to have legal tender status.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Indeed, central bank money is a public good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Euro banknotes fulfil the core function of providing people with risk-free central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">It is crucial to ensure that, as a form of public money, a digital euro enjoys universal reach and acceptance, as the legal tender status provides.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.49,0)">The introduction of a digital euro also raises technical challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Some are related to information technology and cyber risks, which will need to be managed effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.33,0)">Others are related to design choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">In this respect, we can leverage the experience gained in past projects that have put us at the frontier of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Finally, the design of a digital euro would have to be consistent with key policy objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.39,0)">In particular, its design should address the possibility that investors could rapidly move significant amounts of bank deposits into a digital euro, with potential adverse effects on the banking sector and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">We are exploring design strategies to address this and other challenges, and we will assess them in depth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">For instance, we could set the necessary incentives through the remuneration of digital euro holdings, to make sure the digital euro is an attractive means of payment, not a form of investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.77,0)">What next?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Exploring design options, consulting the public and working together Our report also describes the design options we are considering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">We will explore all aspects of different options: whether they are technically feasible, whether they comply with the principles and policy objectives of the Eurosystem, and whether they satisfy the needs of prospective users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But introducing a digital euro is more than a technical question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The value of money – in both physical and digital forms – is rooted in citizens’ trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Acceptance by the public is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">For this reason, today we are launching our public consultation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">We are seeking feedback on the design and on the financial and social issues surrounding the possible introduction of a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We welcome everyone’s views: citizens, merchants, the non-financial sector, professionals from the financial industry, technology companies, and academics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">We encourage everyone to take part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">After the public consultation and a period of preparatory work, the ECB’s Governing Council will decide – towards the middle of 2021 – whether to initiate a fully-fledged project that should lead us to define the specific characteristics of a digital euro and get ready for a possible launch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">This journey will require prudence and perseverance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Since the introduction of the euro, the ECB has been responsible for preserving citizens’ trust in our currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Today, support for the single currency stands at record high levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">To be successful, a digital euro would also have to enjoy strong support from the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">It would be a digital symbol of progress and integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">And it would support the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Issuing a digital euro would be relevant for almost everything the ECB does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.11,0)">And it would affect our society as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">This is why we are seeking, through the public consultation we are launching today, an intense and open dialogue on our recent report with citizens and other stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Together with European institutions and authorities, in primis the European Parliament, we will discuss the framework that would be necessary to introduce a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">As co-legislators and representatives of European citizens, you will have a fundamental role to play in the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">I therefore very much look forward to our first exchange today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">ECB  , Report on a digital euro, Frankfurt
