    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)"> Central banks and the challenges of the zero lower bound Intervention by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the “Meeting on the Financial Crisis”, hosted by the Initiative on Global Markets, at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Miami, 19 February 2012 Ladies and Gentlemen,   It is a great pleasure for me to contribute to this final session on central bank communication and the zero lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.36,0)">Faced with the crisis, central banks had to enter new territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We had to design strategies of intervention that had not been studied much.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I will expand on such strategies, starting from facts and then proceeding to policy approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.91,0)">Most of you will find nothing new in what I’m about to say.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">But a policy-maker’s perspective on facts and on policy approaches might help to establish a better understanding between the theory and practice of monetary policy, and on the specific features of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.84,0)">Central banks in the crisis Let me start with an overview of central bank actions during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Central banks responded to what turned out to be the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression by taking unprecedented measures, both “standard” and “non-standard”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">“Standard” is what you learn in “Econ 1”: a central bank moves its policy rate to influence monetary conditions when an adjustment is needed and uses liquidity interventions only at the margin, to ensure that short-term money market rates remain close to their desired value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.27,0)">“Non-standard” includes any other action that a central bank can take to try and influence monetary conditions when the first avenue is impractical or insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.76,0)">On the “standard” side, central banks have reduced their main policy rates, as well as the rates at which they remunerate reserve balances, to very low levels  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.05,0)">For example, in the euro area, the interest rate on the Eurosystem’s main refinancing operation currently stands at a historically low 1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.55,0)">The rate at which the Eurosystem remunerates liquidity placed on its deposit facility is even lower, at a quarter of 1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.37,0)">In these conditions, and reflecting large amounts of excess liquidity, the overnight interest rate   has remained – for some time now – below the main refinancing rate, and closer to the deposit facility rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.16,0)">On the “non-standard” side, central banks have been experimenting in various ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan have opted in various guises for quantitative easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">As for the ECB, our measures have been tailored to the specificities of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This means assigning banks the central role they play in credit intermediation, with around two-thirds of euro area firms’ external financing intermediated by banks in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.83,0)">This means that any impairment to bank lending will have more serious consequences in the euro area than in other economies where market sources of funding are more important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Accordingly, the ECB’s policies have targeted banks’ funding conditions – by cutting the cost at which banks can borrow and by enhancing the security and stability of their funding over increasing longer horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">With the exception of the covered bonds purchase programme, the ECB has avoided setting quantitative targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">By providing liquidity to the banking sector, particularly in the first phase of the crisis, we have “liquefied” otherwise illiquid assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.15,0)">This has avoided fears of fire sales and forestalled disorderly deleveraging, which in turn would have risked dragging the euro area economy into an ever deeper recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I will come back later to the long-term implications of this crisis intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.84,0)">In the second stage of the crisis, low liquidity in some segments of the government securities markets imposed further strains on banks’ funding conditions, due to the widespread use of these securities in bank secured lending and as liquidity buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.41,0)">Contagion forces quickly found in banks’ exposure to sovereign securities a formidable transmission and amplification channel, threatening the stability of banks and the whole financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">In these circumstances, we, together with other central banks, have increased our lending to replace the withdrawal of private lending in inter-bank transactions and, sometimes, in the broader market for capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">These interventions have served to shore up savers’ confidence in the financial sector and, ultimately, of the currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">They are of course no substitute for the far-reaching reforms needed in fiscal governance and competitiveness, and for banks strengthening their capital basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.7,0)">Whether it’s the direct effect of an active policy of liquidity supply under quantitative easing or the collateral implication of banks’ hoarding behaviours in the euro area, abundant liquidity has gone hand in hand with the cost of borrowing in the money market drifting down to levels close to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.42,0)">A combination of historically low interest rates and stagnant or declining output levels has heightened concerns that central banks’ policies of liquidity provisions may be ineffective and futile, as banks amass “idle” cash rather than lend it out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.52,0)">Some observers fear that a liquidity trap as described by Keynes in the General Theory is looming: banks might be afraid to acquire exposures to any institutions apart from the central bank, in an environment in which interest rates can only be expected to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.74,0)">These views have led to various proposals, all of which aim to discourage banks from holding excess reserves  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.54,0)">In the euro area context, the fear of a liquidity trap seems to me largely unwarranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">First, even though euro area output growth is likely to have been very weak in the last quarter of 2011, there are tentative signs of a stabilisation in economic activity according to the most recent survey data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Looking ahead, we expect the euro area economy to recover very gradually in the course of 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.82,0)">Second, euro area inflation is likely to stay above 2% for several months to come, before declining to below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.93,0)">And third, the substantial build-up of reserves on the liability side of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet simply reflects the accounting counterpart of large-scale liquidity provisions by the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.42,0)">In itself, it does not convey information on the actual effect that such liquidity supply may have on the economy more broadly  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.17,0)">In fact, it does not provide information on the economic trades that any euro injected into the system might generate before returning to the central bank as a temporary cash buffer of the bank that receives the cash at the end of what might be a long transaction cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">This transaction cycle can be an active contributor to the revitalisation of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The example of the recent first three-year LTRO conducted by the Eurosystem in late December 2011 corroborates this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">We have indications that the liquidity provided through this operation is indeed flowing, or will flow, between economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.41,0)">Also, banks borrowing from the Eurosystem are not necessarily the same as those that “park” money in our deposit facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.66,0)">We have also seen interest rates declining all along the yield curve, initially in the short segment and then at longer horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Overall, these developments suggest that such non standard-type measures are likely to have contributed materially to preventing a disorderly de-leveraging of the banking sector as a whole and, through that channel, a far more serious credit crunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.64,0)">Let me now turn to the consequences of a protracted period of low or even negative interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.64,0)">Low interest rates – current and expected I mentioned how abundant liquidity in money markets has compressed money market rates to levels that are considered a floor for “standard” policy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.42,0)">One obvious question is: why should there be a floor, a “lower bound”, in the first place?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.97,0)">Some economists have called for monetary policy makers to push the interest rate at which banks can borrow from the central bank into negative territory  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.81,0)">From a technical point of view, there is in fact nothing that prevents central banks from paying negative rates for the security they offer to depositors, at least temporarily  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.07,0)">Given the costs associated with holding large amounts of banknotes, it is likely that significantly negative interest rates would be required to trigger a switch from money holding to investment in banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">So, there seems to be technical leeway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.91,0)">At the same time, however, negative interest rate trading on, for example, Treasury bills, or – for all practical purposes – trading at interest rates not significantly different from zero certainly necessitates adjustment of market practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.84,0)">And there is a degree of hysteresis: a temporary situation of zero or negative interest rates can have long-lasting implications for banks and their trading incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.23,0)">In theory, everybody would love to borrow at zero or negative rates without going through the pain of finding a creditor happy to take the opposite side of the transaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.13,0)">If the central bank offers this service systematically, banks can dismantle their trading platforms – which are costly to maintain – and become addicted to central bank credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The Japanese experience is of course relevant here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.17,0)">Within three months of the introduction of the zero interest rate policy, the volume of transactions declined by around one-half and low turnover persisted until end-2006 when the zero interest rate policy was discontinued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.35,0)">To be sure, it is difficult to disentangle the impact on money market turnover of zero interest rates from other important determinants, such as increased counterparty risk or ample liquidity provision by the central bank, or the uncertain macroeconomic environment that led to the central bank decision in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Overall, historical evidence does not point unambiguously in one direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.99,0)">But if a protracted period of zero or negative interest rates were to be experienced in the euro area, it would be particularly important not to lose the perspective, and the possibility, of restarting the interbank market at a later stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.21,0)">The intermediation role taken by the central bank cannot, and should not forever take the place of money market activity  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.46,0)">Let me mention two further areas where risks could emerge from zero or even negative interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.7,0)">First, money market activity might suffer beyond the trading incentives effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.24,0)">Important market intermediaries, such as money market funds, could be driven out of business, as their business model loses profitability, for both domestic and foreign investors with excess liquidity may shift their investments to alternative, more profitable market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.64,0)">Second, zero or negative interest rates may produce adverse effects on the profitability of commercial banks and financial intermediaries more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.74,0)">In a financial crisis this can result in a credit contraction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The reason is well known.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.1,0)">Commercial banks may have to keep retail deposit rates unchanged to preserve their deposit base in a context of increased retail funding competition and substitution by banknotes  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.81,0)">But, with lending rates reduced, this hurts banks’ profitability, especially in countries where variable rates predominate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.09,0)">This impact could be particularly pronounced in the case of a widening of the policy rate corridor, with the main refinancing rate remaining unchanged and the remuneration of the deposit facility being adjusted to zero or below.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.34,0)">Commercial bank equity debasement, in turn, can reduce the effectiveness of “non-standard” monetary policy and may even provide incentives for money creation to take place in the shadow banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Other channels – going in the opposite direction – are also conceivable, with search-for-yield considerations prevailing and leading to higher short-term profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.11,0)">All in all, the impact of zero rates on the profitability of banks remains uncertain and highly dependent, among other determinants, on parallel regulatory response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.2,0)">Overall, a switch to zero or negative interest rates bears some risks – mainly of a microeconomic nature – which would have to be weighed against potential benefits in terms of additional macroeconomic stimuli.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.13,0)">It also has to be noted that such steps would be warranted only in the face of clear downward risks to price stability, which today are not present in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.95,0)">In particular, the discussion about deflation risks remains largely speculative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Central bank communication and the zero lower bound Some analysts argue that, when interest rates reach their effective lower bound, central banks should indicate their future intentions more precisely than they do under normal circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.43,0)">Because bondholders are exposed to a risk of capital loss due to the uncertainty about the timing and magnitude of the rise in short-term interest rates that would accompany a future recovery, it is argued that central bank communication could provide insurance against that risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">This is consistent with the adoption of forward guidance by some central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">It is also reflected in the recent decision by the Federal Reserve to release FOMC participants’ projections of the appropriate level of the target of the federal funds rate, including the likely timing of the first increase in the target rate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Risks and mitigants A central bank which promises to maintain interest rates low for a prolonged period entails some risks, a point which economic theory has started to acknowledge and address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Raghuram Rajan has been studying these risks for quite some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.36,0)">The belief that interest rates will stay low for long periods might lead banks to make excessive liquidity promises and increase the future need for low rates, and thus sow the seeds of future crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.51,0)">A second source of risk stems from the implications of low interest rates for balance sheet adjustment in the financial and non-financial sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.87,0)">While low policy rates may in the short term help to prevent a disorderly adjustment of balance sheets and provide some relief in terms of lower interest payments, they also weaken the incentives for repairing balance sheets in the first place  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.62,0)">Thirdly, when confronted with forward guidance, the public may fail to understand the conditionality of the information that is given by the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.66,0)">Such a mismatch between the conditionality of the statement and the public’s expectations can put at risk the credibility and reputation of the central bank, in the event an ex post change in circumstances were to necessitate a change in policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.1,0)">Finally, the publication of an interest rate path, as a way to reinforce forward guidance, can pre-empt private sector expectations and reduce their information content, thereby crowding out valuable private information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.45,0)">Conversely, if financial market expectations differ from the path announced by the central bank, the latter might be perceived as having a credibility or reputation problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.88,0)">Overall, and as suggested by numerous studies  ,  , the costs of an anticipated protracted low rate policy – in terms of fuelling risk-taking, promoting an overhang of non-performing loans and prolonging future imbalances – can be significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.54,0)">What are the mitigants in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I mentioned already our main approach to “non-standard” policy action: provision of unlimited liquidity over long-term maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I note here that this liquidity is provided through reverse repurchase agreements and not through outright purchases of securities, and at low but adjustable   interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In other words, the Eurosystem provides liquidity upfront, while being clear from the start that the cost of that liquidity can only be determined ex post, as economic conditions unfold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There is no trade-off between ex ante commitments and ex post constraints to policies in our “non-standard” operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">In the end, many of the risks we see in central banks’ crisis management practices can be greatly mitigated by an independent statute, a sharp quantitative definition of the price stability objective and a particular emphasis on monetary and financial indicators, all of which help to avoid pro-cyclicality whenever inflation poses less of a threat than financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This latter dimension, for example, allows a more restrictive monetary policy to be pursued during a period of booming asset prices, even in an environment of relatively subdued inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.2,0)">Concluding remarks The financial crisis has posed challenges for us all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">For its part, the ECB has responded to such challenges, by reducing its key interest rates to very low levels as well as by introducing a number of non-standard measures to support funding conditions for banks and thereby maintaining the transmission of its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">These measures have been tailored to the specificities of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The ECB’s standard and non-standard measures ensure that its stance can be adjusted in time to counteract risks to price stability, while addressing remaining impairments to the transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.38,0)">It remains however crucial that the implementation of these measures does not hamper the chances of reviving currently dysfunctional market segments, such as the interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.49,0)">It is also crucial that governments and regulators in specific countries and sectors within the euro area address ongoing funding strains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">I wish to thank Arthur Saint-Guilhem for his contributions to the speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I remain solely responsible for the opinions contained herein.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">For a review of central banks’ experience
