    <h1> Hearing at the European Parliament's Sub-Committee on Monetary				Affairs on 18 January 1999 </h1>
    <h2> Introductory statement delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Brussels, 18 January 1999 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)"> Hearing at the European Parliament's Sub-Committee on Monetary Affairs on 18 January 1999 Introductory statement delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Brussels, 18 January 1999 With the opening statement by the Chairperson of the Sub-Committee, Mrs. Randzio-Plath, and the transcript of the questions and answers On 1 January 1999 a new chapter in European economic history was opened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">After years of intense and thorough preparation, the launch of the single currency in Europe was accomplished successfully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Today, just a little more than two weeks after this historic event, it is a great privilege for me to be here at the European Parliament for another exchange of views with your committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I should like to begin my statement by reviewing the changeover to the euro, including money market developments during the first two weeks of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I shall then go on to summarise the assessment by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank   of the economic environment in which the new currency has been launched and which has shaped our initial decisions about monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Moreover, I shall comment on some of the challenges that lie ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Finally, I shall touch briefly upon some issues related to the communication policy of the European Central Bank, after which I shall, as usual, stand ready to answer any questions you might have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">A.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Transition to the euro The transition of the banking and finance community from the national currencies to the euro in only three and half days after the publication of the conversion rates, was, indeed, a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The smooth migration of all electronic systems and procedures was a sign of the quality of the preparatory work carried out over recent months and years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">In our view, the workforce that was directly involved in the changeover in the global financial markets - including all major financial centres outside the euro area - was probably higher than the 50,000 reported by the media.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Within the Eurosystem, which comprises the ECB and the 11 participating national central banks  , preparations had been ongoing for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The first plan of action for the changeover weekend had already been approved by the EMI Council in March 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">After the establishment of the ECB, the Governing Council examined reports on the changeover at four of its meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.65,0)">During the changeover weekend several thousand staff members were at work or on call at the ECB and the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.08,0)">The major concern of the Governing Council was to avoid a breakdown in the transition to the euro - at the ECB, at any NCB or within any of the systems of the "core infrastructure" of financial markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For this reason, the ECB made recommendations to credit institutions and securities settlement systems and set up a procedure for monitoring developments within and outside the European System of Central Banks   during the weekend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Moreover, the decision-making bodies of the ECB stood ready to convene extraordinary meetings via teleconference and to adopt, if needed, contingency measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.1,0)">The latter was not necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.56,0)">The monitoring of conversion activities conducted by the ESCB during the changeover weekend revealed no incident that might have impaired the smooth start of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">As to the involvement of the Eurosystem in the changeover activities, I should like to mention that I had the honour of attending the meeting of the ECOFIN Council on 31 December 1998, during which the conversion rates were irrevocably fixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I delivered personally to the ECOFIN Council the Opinion of the ECB on the proposed conversion rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">On the morning of 31 December, the Eurosystem had contributed to the computation of the conversion rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Later on, the Governing Council had, with the participation of the national central bank governors of the countries not adopting the euro at the start of Stage Three, a meeting by means of a teleconference to approve its legal Opinion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">The Eurosystem also contributed to the dissemination of the conversion rates in a prompt and secure manner to the banking and finance community, as requested by market operators in order to enable them to start their conversion activities as soon as possible in the early afternoon of 31 December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In addition, on 31 December 1998 the euro central rates for the Danish krone and the Greek drachma in ERM II were agreed by written procedure between the relevant parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">The new central rates are in line with the previous ones, after allowing for minor deviations due to rounding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Moreover, the ECB, Danmarks Nationalbank and the Bank of Greece established by common accord and announced, on the same day, the compulsory intervention rates for the Danish krone and the Greek drachma.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.45,0)">Fluctuations of the two currencies during the first two weeks of the year remained subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">B.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Market developments in the first two weeks of January With a view to ensuring a smooth transition to the euro, the Governing Council took two important decisions already on 22 December 1998, in order to give guidance to the markets on the monetary conditions at the outset of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First, it was decided to start the provision of liquidity via the first tender operation, which was carried out in the first week, at a fixed rate of 3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The Governing Council also agreed that the interest rate for the marginal lending facility would be set at 4.50% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Together, these two rates form the so-called "corridor" for movements in short-term rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">However, the Governing Council considered the possibility that market participants may need some time to accustom themselves to the new environment for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To this end, it was decided to use a relatively narrow corridor of interest rates for the standing facilities of the Eurosystem in the first three weeks of Stage Three as an automatic device to reduce the maximum range of fluctuations in the overnight interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.88,0)">Accordingly, the Governing Council temporarily introduced an exceptionally narrow corridor of only 50 basis points, with the interest rate for the marginal lending facility at 3.25% and the interest rate for the deposit facility at 2.75%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.35,0)">This measure will be terminated on 21 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Indeed, this guidance given to the markets proved to be justified, since market developments over the first days showed that the formation of the single European money market would not happen overnight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.05,0)">There were signs that short-term market rates in the different countries were not fully aligned and, in particular, that the spreads between the highest and lowest rates were larger than is normal in an integrated money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">The counterparties of the Eurosystem made very high use of the marginal lending facility at 3.25%  , since this rate was only slightly higher than the prevailing market conditions for overnight borrowing in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.22,0)">The overnight EONIA rate for effective market transactions was 3.20% and credit institutions may have preferred to pay a slightly higher rate instead of entering into market transactions with other banks across the borders The counterparties also deposited large amounts overnight with the Eurosystem  , as they may not have been willing or able to lend them to other market counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">In the meantime, this situation has been overcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.8,0)">The spread between the highest and the lowest rates reported to the ECB by banks of the EONIA   panel has narrowed from 21 basis points on 4 January to below 10 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.23,0)">Moreover, the use of the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility has been significantly reduced to a more normal level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">A further confirmation of the increasing integration of money markets in the euro area is the growing use of payment and securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">On 5 January 1999 the value of cross-border transactions settled through TARGET had already exceeded EUR 310 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.48,0)">Including domestic real-time gross settlement   transactions, which themselves accounted for at least another EUR 660 billion, the total value of transactions settled was therefore almost EUR 1,000 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This amount corresponds to about 17% of last year's GDP of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In the meantime, the total volume of transactions has increased further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Moreover, the extensive use of the so-called correspondent central banking model   - a mechanism which permits banks to make cross-border use of eligible assets as collateral in monetary policy operations and payment systems - suggests that market integration is proceeding well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The TARGET system, the cross-border payment system of the ESCB, has contributed substantially to the integration of the euro money market and it has made possible the consolidation of the treasury management of institutions with different activity centres throughout Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">TARGET has processed more cross-border payments than anticipated in these early days of Monetary Union and, in so doing, has amply demonstrated its processing capacities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Given the extensive use of the system, the ECB recently decided to extend the operating hours of the TARGET system by one hour to 7 p.m. for a limited period ending on 31 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">This should alleviate some of the time pressure on commercial banks when familiarising themselves with the TARGET rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Similarly, the Governing Council decided that, during this transition period, the deposit facility of the Eurosystem would be available until one hour after the closure of TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I should like to also mention the results of the two first main refinancing operations of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">EUR 75 allocated at a fixed rate of 3% to the banking system under the first operation, while the amount for the second operation was, under the same conditions, EUR 48 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In addition, on 13 January 1999 the ECB allocated EUR 45 billion in three tranches with maturities of 42, 70 and 105 days through its first longer term financing operation, at marginal single rates of respectively 3.13 %, 3.10 % and 3.08 %.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">We have provided sufficient liquidity to allow credit institutions, on aggregate, to neutralise their monetary reserve deficit relatively soon within the first reserve maintenance period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">C. Current economic developments and prospects The Governing Council's decisions on the initial level of interest rates for the euro area, announced on 22 December 1998, have been made with a view to the objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The decisions were taken on the basis of a thorough assessment of the monetary, financial and economic situation in the euro area and against the background of the stability-oriented monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">As you will be aware, the Governing Council has announced a quantitative definition of price stability, measured on the basis of a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The monetary policy strategy further consists of two key elements; first, a reference value of 4 1/2% for annual growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3 and, second, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and the risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The views of the Governing Council on the monetary and financial situation, the economic conjuncture and prospects for price developments in the euro area which underpinned its decisions on the appropriate monetary policy stance to be adopted were set out at a press conference at the time of the announcement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In addition, a more detailed assessment of the economic situation underlying the Governing Council's monetary policy decisions will be released in the ECB's first Monthly Bulletin, to be published tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This will include a commentary on the economic situation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me briefly summarise the main features of our assessment of the current economic situation and outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.55,0)">As regards monetary developments, which are monitored on the basis of a three-month moving average of the 12-month growth rate of M3  , the Governing Council set the first reference value at 4 1/2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">The latest three-month moving average of annual growth in M3 was around 4.7%, which is very close to the reference value and compatible with the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">A broader assessment of economic and financial developments supported the available monetary data in signalling the absence of significant upward or downward pressures on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Financial indicators suggested that market participants expect the current climate of price stability to continue in the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.77,0)">In this context, it may be observed that at the start of Stage Three nominal short-term and long-term interest rates in the euro area have reached levels which are very low by historical standards and that real interest rates are also significantly below their long-term averages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.54,0)">The real long-term interest rate is currently at a level of about 3 %, which is approximately 1 percentage point below the level prevailing at the end of 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.91,0)">Increases in consumer prices, as measured by 12-month-changes in the HICP, have been around 1% since autumn 1998, falling to 0.9% in November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.59,0)">The rate of increase in service prices has remained unchanged at around 2%, but increases in goods prices are much lower, at 0.3%, reflecting downward influences on both food and industrial consumer goods prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.09,0)">Energy prices have also continued to contribute to moderate price developments, falling by 4.3% in the 12 months to November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">In addition, modest developments in unit labour costs are a further key factor underpinning the current low rate of consumer price increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">The preliminary data released by EUROSTAT for the third quarter of 1998 showed euro area-wide real GDP growth at 2.4%, thus reflecting some deceleration compared with the first half of the year when output growth averaged 3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Growth has increasingly been driven by domestic demand rather than net exports in the course of 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Private consumption, in particular, has been robust, supported by growth in employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.93,0)">However, unemployment in the euro area remains very high   and is declining only gradually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.19,0)">In the short term, output growth is expected to slow somewhat as a consequence of a weaker global environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.88,0)">In addition to the lower real GDP growth figure in the third quarter, further evidence of an economic slowdown has been provided by survey data, most notably on order books and industrial confidence, which have weakened significantly since the spring of 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.79,0)">Industrial production growth also slowed during the course of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">By contrast, consumer confidence was quite resilient, providing some support to domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.76,0)">There is considerable uncertainty about the impact of external developments on the euro area, not least because of recent events in Brasil, but the slowdown is currently expected to be temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The current low levels of short and long-term interest rates in the euro area should contribute to sustained confidence and domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Overall, the Governing Council felt that the risks to price stability appear to be balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.26,0)">However, there is a potential downside risk to the global situation, which could lead to lower inflation via a more pronounced growth slowdown in the euro area and weaker import and producer prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.4,0)">On the other hand, higher-than-expected wage increases and/or a relaxation of the fiscal stance could lead to higher price increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The ECB will continue to monitor these developments closely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">D. Challenges ahead Looking ahead, the introduction of the euro and a stability-oriented monetary policy will contribute significantly to the creation of the conditions necessary for improved growth and employment prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">However, important challenges remain, two of which I should like to mention in particular: In order to achieve a sustained and substantial reduction in unemployment, it remains necessary to press ahead with structural reforms to labour and product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.7,0)">As I have already mentioned, the rate of unemployment in the euro area has remained very high, at 10.8%, despite real GDP growth of around 3% in the first half of 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Monetary policy will play its part by continuing to pursue its objective of maintaining price stability, thus helping to keep inflationary expectations and risk premia in long-term interest rates low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Some benefits from price stability have already been seen in the decline in long-term interest rates to below 4% by the end of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.87,0)">Moreover, as I have already mentioned, real long-term interest rates have also declined substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">However, while this should foster investment and employment growth, it cannot by itself reduce structural unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.66,0)">Fiscal imbalances, reflected in both current deficit and debt levels in relation to GDP, are also a major challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">A sound and sustainable policy framework is characterised by fiscal policies which are consistent with the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Compared with the progress in fiscal consolidation achieved in previous years, only a small reduction in the euro area-wide budget deficit is estimated to have occurred in 1998: to 2.3 % from 2.5% in 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Moreover, the decline was the result of favourable cyclical developments together with savings in interest payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.87,0)">After adjusting for the cyclical effects of stronger growth, the "structural deficit" actually worsened somewhat in 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.07,0)">According to the European Commission, this is the first such deterioration since 1991.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">The ratio of euro area general government debt to GDP is estimated by the European Commission to have been 73.8% in 1998, which is well above the reference level of 60%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.86,0)">Deficit ratios are still too high to put debt levels on a rapidly declining path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Fiscal plans should thus be aimed at ensuring early compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, which includes a commitment to achieving fiscal positions "close to balance or in surplus" in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">This is also required in order to allow automatic stabilisers to work without exceeding the 3% deficit ceiling in less prosperous times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">E. Communication policy of the Eurosystem Coming now to the last part of my statement, I should like to touch briefly upon some decisions related to the ECB's communication policy that have been taken recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.26,0)">As you might be aware, the ECB published, on 5 January 1999, a consolidated opening financial statement of the Eurosystem, and subsequently, on 12 January, the first weekly financial statement, containing the assets and liabilities held by the ECB and the national central banks of the euro area vis-à-vis third parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">With a view to providing regular information, in particular on monetary policy operations and changes in foreign reserves, the ECB will continue to publish a weekly financial statement every Tuesday, accompanied by an explanatory note, in all official EU languages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.45,0)">As already indicated, the ECB will release the first edition of its Monthly Bulletin tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It will contain an assessment of the current economic situation underlying the ECB's monetary policy decisions and also tables and charts covering a wide range of statistics relevant to monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In addition, the ECB will continue to release current monetary statistics on wire services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">I should like to conclude by emphasising that these publications, together with the regular press conferences following the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB and the numerous speeches given by the members of the Executive Board, demonstrate the importance which we attach to explaining the ECB's monetary policy in a clear and transparent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I am now at your disposal to answer your questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Transcript of the Questions and Answers with the opening statement by the Chairperson of the Sub-Committee, Mrs. Randzio-Plath This text is based on the English translation of the debate Mrs Randzio-Plath  : Thank you very much colleagues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">I would like to convene the first meeting of the Monetary Subcommittee in this very important year of 1999 when EMU has begun, and I would like to extend a very cordial welcome to the President of the ECB, Wim Duisenberg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">We are having this first monetary dialogue at point in time when the ECB enjoys exclusive decision-making powers in the area of monetary policy and is able to carry out these powers and this was established at the meeting of the Council of the European System of Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We are very impressed indeed with the introduction of the euro and its very smooth introduction to replace the national currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We have seen that the euro has been readily accepted not just in financial markets, not just in the EU but in all regions of the world and I, myself, would wish that certain childhood diseases, that we're not going to talk about today, would in fact belong in past history in this era of the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is the first month, January, of EMU and we recognise that unfortunately fees are being charged for exchange operations, up to 4%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.46,0)">That's from one EMU currency to another and that is not in the interests of our citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">I, myself, exchanged 10 Deutsche Marks and received French francs back to the equivalent of 7 Deutsche Marks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.36,0)">Now these are things that our citizens will fail to understand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.48,0)">The euro age should surely not have these effects on our fellow citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">They will find it difficult to follow and we must push the private sector, the banks and savings banks and I hope that they are going to improve this so that the euro is going to be readily accepted without any hiccups, certainly in the EU and the euro-11 area in a more natural way than perhaps it is at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">So may I invite you, President, to speak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We would like to progress together in this euro era and I understand that you have provided a preliminary copy of the first monthly bulletin of the European Central Bank to the Committee which was presented this morning in Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">That has been made available to all Members of the Subcommittee and you have the floor, Sir.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">*** Mrs Randzio-Plath: Thank you very much indeed, President, for those very clear words concerning monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">You cover transparency, the need for work with the public and the move from the second to the third stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Now, before I come onto questions I would like to welcome Mr van Velzen's and Mr Goedbloed's visitors groups and particularly my colleagues from National Parliaments, Mr Didden from Belgium and Mr Ahern from Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Questions relative to the changeover to the euro Mr Metten: First of all may I start by saying that I had hoped that the monthly bulletin from the ECB would be available today because that would mean that we would have the figures in front of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg says it is only going to be available tomorrow but we would have been able to put specific questions if we had these figures in front of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">However I would like to restrict myself to questions and the introduction of the euro in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Now in 2002 we don't want to have two legal tender currencies at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.84,0)">Some member countries are thinking about a legal big bang.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In other words there is only going to be the national legal tender up until 1st January 2002 and then there will be an overnight change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This means that we will have to teach the public how to deal with the euro without the euro actually being a method of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.31,0)">The euro will be a foreign currency that you change at a bank when you go abroad on holidays.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.54,0)">Now on 7th January the Governing Council of the ECB said that, on the basis of Regulation 974, it would be impossible to have the euro in circulation at the same time as the national currencies before 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.28,0)">My question is the following, the text of the Regulation, which according to your text can be adjusted, is that the basis for your complaint or does it go deeper than this?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The implication is that circulation of two legal tenders after 1st January 2002 should be possible if not necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg: On the issue of frontloading it is our view that frontloading to the general public is the same as issuing or putting the money into circulation and it has been agreed to start the issuance of the euro banknotes and coins only on January 1st 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.97,0)">We are of the opinion that also in order to avoid confusion amongst the public, that frontloading to the general public is to be avoided not only on grounds of the decisions of the Council  , that have been published in May 1998 but also that it is undesirable for substantive reasons ; namely to avoid as much as possible confusion on which currency is in circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">On the other hand we have full understanding for the desire of market operators, that is banks, shops, firms, retail organisations, to have the new currency already available some time before they can be put into circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Therefore we had also our decision of two weeks ago, which includes the statement that frontloading to banks, to retail organisations and other interested parties except the general public is permissible and possible provided that there are legal or contractual arrangements which prevent that frontloaded currency be made available to the general public in an indirect way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.54,0)">Mr Metten: I understand that the first argument is the text of the Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.98,0)">Mr Wellink said, we can't change that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.8,0)">The second argument is one of confusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.41,0)">Now the circulation of two legal tenders after 2002, is that not confusing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.87,0)">And a second point is, the status of the euro which will be frontloaded before 2002, is that not comparable with foreign currency where the consumer also knows, well I can't yet pay with it, at least I can't pay with that currency in the country where I have exchanged it but I can only use it in the country where it's a legal tender?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg: I believe those two questions to be very similar indeed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The co-existence of two currencies during a certain period may also create confusion and so I have full understanding for every effort that is being made in many countries to let that period last as briefly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We hope that the public already becomes so familiar with the euro in the meantime that we will be able to minimise that potential confusion, but totally avoid it, we cannot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Mr Herman: Several governments have launched the idea of reducing the first phase from three to two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.24,0)">Now what are the reasons why this is considered to be impossible?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg: I don't say that it is impossible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.56,0)">I think that shortening that period by one full year is technically impossible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We need more time to produce the notes and in particular the coins, although as a Central Bank we have not much to do with that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We need more time than the limited time of two years which would only then be available or even less than two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.97,0)">Given the fact that it is intended to put into circulation notes and coins simultaneously, one could imagine however, that for notes special measures would be taken to shorten the production period, but it would be a costly operation to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.02,0)">It would not be possible to shorten the period by more than just a few months, technically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.83,0)">It would, more politically, imply the requirement for many organisations to change their investment plans and their planning procedures which they now have made justifiably on the basis of the announcement that the introduction would be on 1st January 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.98,0)">In a way if we were now to shorten that period that could, although not legally, be interpreted as a breach of trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There are organisations in various countries amongst which governments or local governments which have already announced that they need the full period up until 1st January 2002 in order to adjust all their systems, software applications etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Mr Langen: Yes, indeed President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.49,0)">In December Mr Kopper stated in Strasbourg that in technical terms it ought to be possible to reduce it by one or one and half years, down to eighteen months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.06,0)">What was at stake here was that the National Central Banks did not want to have the private sector producing banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.85,0)">Is that the opinion of a maverick banker?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Or do you share that view?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.39,0)">Mr Duisenberg: Well the answer is that I don't share that view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.24,0)">I have of course consulted technicians again ahead of this meeting also and asked them what would be possible and what would not be possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">One has to realise that the mass production of notes has not even begun.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The production will start only in late February or early March and then orders have been placed to produce a quantity of 13 billion banknotes and it is envisaged that that process should be completed by 1st September 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Also the investment plans of the printing firms, of all the paper firms have been based on the fact that this process should be completed by 1st September 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.07,0)">Technically, it is my conviction, it simply is impossible to shorten that period by more than a couple of months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.87,0)">And then my question is what really are we talking about, if that is all that is possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.17,0)">And the problem seems to be even larger where coins are concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.26,0)">There, the production and logistical efforts are far more complicated than in the case of banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">One also has to remember that the production of the euro coins has up until today started only in four of the eleven participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.17,0)">Mrs Peijs: Mr Duisenberg, you said that according to the May Regulation, it is not possible to distribute the Euro notes and coins four days in advance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.64,0)">You then say that for technical reasons the transition period cannot be reduced to one and half years but not under the Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Now this implies that the Regulation can be changed if indeed that were to be the will of all those concerned in the European Union and I think that would be very useful indeed to get rid of people's fears and worries about this transition, this change-over weekend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.11,0)">You were also talking about confusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I would say that I am in favour of one national tender but if on 1st January 2002, if the public is expected to keep a currency separate, what about blind people's organisations, shouldn't they get the coins and notes four days beforehand so that they can get accustomed to this?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.76,0)">And by way of conclusion, Mr Duisenberg, I would say that in the European Union we think that the best educated consumers in the world are being insulted if they will not be entrusted with keeping money for four days before they can actually use it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.36,0)">Mr Duisenberg: Of course one can change a decision and revoke old ones but as I said is it worthwhile to do it for only four days or one week?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.73,0)">I have serious doubts whether that would be wise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To my mind, it would also imply a not so stable and certain policy making process, as has been demonstrated by already publishing the decisions on when the currency would be introduced as early as May 1998 and by giving a clear indication to all concerned - that is Governments, the public, industry, services industries - that that would be the time that they had available to adjust all their systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.56,0)">Then, to have it four days earlier than envisaged on 1st January, of course that would be technically possible, I don't deny that, but I think it would be less than desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.33,0)">I ask myself what are the gains that you achieve by doing that and then by putting into circulation money around Christmas yime, that is the time when money in circulation reaches its peak of the year in all countries ; precisely at that moment then to introduce new notes and coins seems to me to be less than desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.73,0)">Ms Torres Marques: What is your opinion on the irksome bank charges and excessive minimum charges that are made on exchange operations?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg: I have not yet full information of how it is across the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.18,0)">Second, although I have no competence in the field to do something about it, I do with you deplore it if the rates that are being charged by financial organisations to make the change were proved to be excessively high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Then I would hope that at least market competition would lead to reduce unacceptably high charges as soon as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.9,0)">Questions on monetary policy issues Mr Hendrick: The Financial Times of 5th January stated "several German Central Bankers said privately they might have cut interest rates earlier had it not been for political pressure".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.64,0)">This suggests the central bankers knowingly conducted the wrong policy to keep up an appearance of independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.72,0)">Now although this happened before the European Central Bank started to operate monetary policy it might still point to a potential problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.08,0)">The implication of this is that the banks knowingly delayed the interest cut.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Could I ask Mr Duisenberg's view on that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.05,0)">In particular as politicians cannot and should not be stopped from giving their views about monetary policy in public, will the ECB adopt a reasoned approach in this respect which means that if politicians are right at some stage to call for a cut or rise in the interest rate the ECB - provided they agreed on the need for a cut - would not delay the cut or dismiss it purely to provide the appearance of independence?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.58,0)">Mr Duisenberg: Well the question starts with an hypothesis, that something would be true which I simply can say is not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The decision on 3rd December to announce already the extraordinary decision of a coordinated cut in interest rates to a level of 3% from the then prevailing level in most countries of 3.3% and in some countries of even more than that was taken under circumstances when at the same time there was big political pressure to lower interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Yet of course we have felt that pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We have noted it but it has not influenced us to do precisely that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.96,0)">Neither has it led to postpone it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">On the contrary the decision to already on 3rd December announce a cut of interest rates and then on 22nd December to confirm that that interest rate would also be the interest rate with which we would enter stage three of monetary union, both were decisions which were contrary to what you suggest following the Financial Times were brought forward rather than anything else with a view to provide the market with as much certainty and a sense of continuity as we could.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And those were decisions which were made in full independence, independent also of any pressure which might be exerted anywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.96,0)">Of course with you I regard it, as I have said publicly, as completely normal that politics or politicians sometimes will try to give a certain advice to the monetary authorities what to do, although in my experience I have seldom, if ever, received the advice to raise interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Normally it goes in the other direction and that I regard as normal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.51,0)">Equally I regard it as normal for an independent Central Bank to come with its own judgement and ignore any advice given on political grounds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Mr Hendrick: Given recent statistical indications, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.53,0)">constant consumer prices and declining producer prices, does Mr Duisenberg not believe that the European economy has already entered a slight deflationary phase since at least June of last year, or at least come critically close to it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.23,0)">And given that the European economy will continue to experience the negative effects of the international financial crisis, is there not a danger that a more serious deflation is threatening us in the months to come which might not yet be recorded in the latest statistical data?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.43,0)">Mr Duisenberg: Well may I pretend or say that very careful analysis of all the available data does not suggest, as I indicated in my statement, that we have entered a deflationary phase as you call it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">I did mention to you that the composition of the price increase figures that I mentioned for November contains a 2% increase in prices of services and only a 0.3% increase in the prices of goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.73,0)">In addition it has to be remembered that some of the factors that have brought inflation down so much are by themselves of a temporary nature as we assume that for example the fall in energy prices which has greatly contributed to the lowering of the inflation levels is in itself of a temporary nature, at least it will not continue, it cannot continue at the rate at which it has.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.94,0)">And then indications are, as I said, that it is not impossible that wage pressures may increase somewhat and we have taken that into account and we have seen that the impetus of the process of fiscal consolidation in the direction of the aims of the stability and growth pact clearly seems to have weakened in the course of the year 1998 and also as contained in the plans, as far as we know them, for the year 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">So we see on balance no forces either for inflation to increase nor for inflation to diminish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Were we to see so, and I have said that we monitor developments very closely then of course we could come up with new decisions but for the future as far as we can foresee it now, the foreseeable future, we think that the level of interest rates we have chosen towards the end of 1998 is an appropriate one for the current economic situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.69,0)">Mr Hoppenstedt: Mr Duisenberg you said that economic growth estimated for the third quarter was not very optimistic for this year and you said that there are challenges in the reform of structures, in the labour market and the products market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And my question to you is can you just give advice on to how this should happen, or indeed are you also accompanying this with monetary policy measures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.02,0)">Mr Duisenberg: I'm not quite sure that I understood the question precisely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">We are living in a time of very great uncertainties about the global environment and the worsening economic climate globally, although in some areas of the world the economic climate already is improving again, I'm thinking of certain parts of Asia and the way it will have an impact on the euro area-wide economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.66,0)">A few international institutions have recently revised downwards their estimates for growth in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.92,0)">We have not, not even internally, done so yet but we are carefully monitoring the situation and, as I said, we regard, as far as monetary policy is concerned, the level at which the key rates have been set which imply markets interest rates which are lower than at any time since World War II, as appropriate for the time being, for the present economic situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Mr García-Margallo y Marfil: Thank you very much Mr President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.91,0)">I have a short question about the situation in Brazil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Can this have an impact on other areas such as Argentina and Chile?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Secondly, from the internal point of view, one of the reasons which led to deciding on a central system but on a decentralised execution was to maintain a neutrality in the financial market place to avoid the dismantling of the markets and also concentration of operations in a limited number of market places.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However, there is doubt over the concept and form of the national market places in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Has the European Central Bank decided to set up a monitoring system to assess how exchanges take place as well as the risks of geographical concentration of such operations?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.78,0)">That is my question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg: On Brazil, I can be very brief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">In recent discussions with the Central Bankers of the countries mentioned by you, they proved to be very confident that any contagion effects of the Brazilian crisis on their economies, Argentina, Mexico, would be very limited indeed and that the effects could well be contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">So far market developments seem to prove them right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.93,0)">But of course the tumultuous events are of only a very recent nature so it may be too early to give a final judgement there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.45,0)">Now the second question, I honestly didn't understand what the question was.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The monitoring of the exchanges euro-wide is taking place both at the national level and at the central level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">At the European Central Bank there is a lively exchange of information and providing of information to the European Central Bank by the National Central Banks on the monitoring of all the financial market places, which so far in the first two weeks of operation has proven to work out very satisfactorily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Mr Donnelly: Well President can I also congratulate Mr Duisenberg and his colleagues for the very successful launch of the euro and I think it is a very good sign for the developments of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.01,0)">But I want to come back on the point that Mr Hendrick made because, with great respect to you Mr President, I think you were rather dismissive of the question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.87,0)">And the question is very clear that if you look at Japan you've had a movement in Japan in their economy down to zero inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.62,0)">You therefore have a liquidity trap where the citizens in Japan prefer to keep their assets in monetary reserves - in other words they collect savings - and as a result monetary policy is having no impact on the Japanese economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.74,0)">Now I know that there is an argument about whether monetary policy has any role in the overall role of the management of the economy, but the fact is that if you look at the statistics, at the end of last year we are moving very close to zero in terms of inflation in France and Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.6,0)">Now I really don't accept your answer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">I think it's rather dismissive of the Parliament just to say oh well if trends change then of course we'll take appropriate action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.24,0)">Are you saying today to us absolutely there is no threat of the Japanese scenario occurring in the European Union in the euro-area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.89,0)">And if not, why can you not spell it out rather more clearly because of course if you look at the domestic output price index or the producer price index this has actually been continually declining since December 1997 and there is a serious worry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And can I just ask one other point, which I think is rather important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.46,0)">I look at the terms of reference of the Central Bank and we have a Governing Council that is meeting every two weeks and therefore the Governing Council of course is running the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.4,0)">Is the Executive Board fulfilling any other task other than acting as a secretariat to the Governing Council of the Central Bank?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.41,0)">Mr Duisenberg: I'll take the last question first.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.42,0)">The Executive Board of the European Central Bank : all six of them are individual members - with full voting rights - of the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.14,0)">So, that part of the work, they do perform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Moreover, they coordinate all activities of the European System of Central Banks, the ECB and the NCBs of the participating Member States in a very active manner and thereby not only acting as secretaries but rather more often than not as the initiative takers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">That's not what you hear, but it's what I do and very much we have the feeling that that is precisely what we are doing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.24,0)">On the second part, what has Japan achieved by following a monetary policy which has brought interest rates down with official interest rates to 0,25%?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.98,0)">Further than that they cannot go, but the results for the real economy so far have demonstrably been very meagre indeed to say the least.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.75,0)">We have an interest rate level, in a time when growth admittedly shows signs of coming down somewhat, of deceleration, but still the expectation is there will be growth, still the expectation is that the deceleration will be only temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In that context then to have interest rates at a level which is lower than at any time over the last 50 years seems to us to be an appropriate decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">You may compare these interest rates with those in Japan, I would also like to compare them with those in the United States, which seems to go through a similar phase of the economic cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.54,0)">We have interest rates at least 150 basis points lower than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.74,0)">Mr Donnelly: Well you see that's not really the question I put to you because as we know the Japanese started reducing their interest rates too late.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.78,0)">They started reducing their interest rates as their economy slipped into recession and I'm asking you whether or not we run the same risk that you may take action, as you said earlier of course politicians always ask for interest rates cuts, but that we end up taking the action too late and therefore monetary policy has no impact which is what's happened in Japan?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.26,0)">Mr Duisenberg: Yes, but then our analysis, and I can say it is shared by the Ministers of the Euro-11 group whose meeting, as indicated, I attended this morning, does not show or demonstrate or yield to the result that we are already moving into a recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.53,0)">We are moving from a period where we had above average growth, above trend rate growth - think of the 3% during the first half of 1998 - into a period where growth will be somewhat slower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.97,0)">I define a recession as a continued period of more than a few quarters of no or negative growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Then by no means are we moving in that direction according to our analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Mr Porto: Before my questions I would like to come back to this point of my colleagues Hendrick and Donnelly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">So you think that there is no deflation, but supposing that there is deflation, you said I took note, you would take new decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.11,0)">What kind of decisions would you take in the case there was deflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And my main question, if I can, it's about Brazil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">There is a big discussion between the former Governor of the Bank of Brazil and the new Governor because the first one tried to have stable prices and with a very strong rate of exchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.01,0)">Do you think the former Governor was right, or the present one, about decisions taken last week?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg: Well I don't want to suppose that there were deflation because I don't think there is deflation but taking the academic view point, if there were to be a further sustained deceleration of prices then a relaxation of monetary policy would be called for and we would take decisions accordingly without any doubt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.15,0)">On Brazil, really Mrs Chairman, I would prefer not to take sides with the previous or the current Governor of the Central Bank of Brazil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Mr Giansily: President, with regard to the Chinese and Japanese operators how do you see their view on the euro and also on the ECB to manage the exchange rate with the dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Are you ready to answer certain requests linked to the fact that the Chinese might switch reserves of their Central Bank into euro to make it equivalent to their dollar reserves?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Mrs Randzio-Plath: This question we can also take for the subject number 4 if you don't mind because we wanted now to discuss monetary polices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.08,0)">Monetary Policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.75,0)">Mr Wolf: I should also like to raise a question about deflation which has already been put here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">First of all, as far as I know with the German price index, the price development has always been overestimated by about 0.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.82,0)">Has the ECB carried out investigations or plans to investigate the extent to which the Eurostat price index overestimates prices?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I think that's important, that was my first point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.77,0)">Secondly I would like to put a question and I think it is a question of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Are you discussing, in the Euro-11, on matters of monetary policy and exchange rate policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.24,0)">Mr Duisenberg: The ECB closely follows the inflation figures, of course, but we cannot yet measure or make even an effort to measure this so-called measurement bias in inflation, because the series we have for our core rate of inflation, that is the harmonised index of consumer prices, only has a very recent history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.35,0)">We simply don't have the data for a sufficiently long period of time to make an acceptable effort to measure the potential measurement bias.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.56,0)">We think there is one as there is one in every inflation index all over the world, in Germany, in the United States, in the United Kingdom, everywhere but we are not sure yet what it would be in the euro area and because of that uncertainty that is also the main reason why when publishing our definition of price stability we have published an upper bound but not made very precise or explicit a lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">We have said we measure price stability by a rate of increase, thereby giving a bias in the positive direction, by a rate of increase over the medium term of below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As I also have indicated in various public statements and in answers to questions, also here in this Parliament, you can be sure that we dislike deflation as much as we dislike inflation so implicitely there is a lower limit but we cannot yet measure or even try to measure the potential measurement bias that is contained in these figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Now in the Euro-11 meetings, the debate in which I participate on the current economic situation covers all aspects of economic developments including monetary developments but also fiscal developments and well it is only understandable that in the dialogue which is developing in the Euro-11 I have the inclination to talk a little bit more about fiscal developments than most Ministers do and Ministers have the inclination to talk a little bit more about monetary developments than the President of the Central Bank does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Mr Wolf: First of all if it is uncertain then shouldn't we start thinking how a preventive policy could be carried out against inflation because that may come about and secondly the question on exchange rate policy in the Euro-11 was mentioned but you didn't take up that point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg: We are following a preventive policy by pursuing a policy which is aiming at price stability over the medium term and it is a forward looking policy so in that way it is preventive but we think that by setting the interest rates at an historically low level for the foreseeable future, and I cannot specify how long we can foresee that future, we give as much certainty and a feeling of continuity and stability to the markets as we can.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">We think this is most conducive to the growth of income and employment, but it is preventive in the sense of a forward looking policy formulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Exchange rate policy has not been discussed if that answers your question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Mrs Randzio-Plath: Thank you very much Mr Duisenberg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I would like to come back again to the question of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.92,0)">There is a kind of asymmetry between the competence of acting in the ECB in questions of inflation and deflation and how do you interprete in the ECB Article 105.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.91,0)">I still fail to understand when the time is that the ECB must act in order to support employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">If it is clear from the stability programmes that the Governments of the Member States respect at this stage the stability pact and on the other hand the trade unions are carrying out very cautious wage policy, do you already at this stage have a clearer opinion, a clearer position especially in view of the father of the euro that the euro could be too strong rather than too weak?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg: I don't see an asymmetry in the competences of the European Central Bank to take decisions and as far as Article 105 is concerned the European Central Bank shall contribute to the general goals of the European Community in terms of promoting growth and employment as far as the primary aim of price stability is not being endangered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">But then it is our strong belief that the best contribution that monetary policy can make precisely to that end, is to create and maintain a climate of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">As I indicated in my introductory statement to the extent that that climate then contributes to the lowest possible risk premium which is contained in the long-term interest rate and in inflationary expectations that is to our mind the best contribution that monetary policy in those circumstances can make.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I would warn against the reasoning that now that we have achieved price stability with a certain level of interest rates, we should change track and focus on other things, in the interest of economic policy in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Our aim isnot only to have price stability but also to maintain it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That is explicitly in our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.5,0)">Mrs Randzio-Plath: But if we have an inflation rate tending towards zero and if you look at the real interest rates then don't you think that for economic growth, investment it is the real interest rate in the EU which is still too high, the real interest rates?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.44,0)">Mr Duisenberg: Well the real interest rates as I said are lower than they have been for a very long time and I want to point to the fact that as I also already earlier said they have come down over the past year by about 100 basis points so that development has already by itself had the beneficial effect of contributing to a resumption of growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Mr Lindqvist: Thank you Madame President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The introduction seems to have been relatively successful as you said.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Electronics and data and technics have functioned well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.12,0)">But when there will come crisis, with economic, regional differences, increased unemployment, winners or losers about the euro, what readiness do you have for real life?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Meaning is it the stability and growth pact which is the readiness you have or will it be the direction of changes in the meaning of more of finance and tax harmonisation in line with the proposal from the German Finance Minister?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.39,0)">That's my question.</span>
