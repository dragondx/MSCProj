    <span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)"> How innovative should central banks be?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.77,0)">Keynote speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at Wirtschaftsgipfel 2014 “Wirtschaft neu denken – die Kraft der Innovation” organised by Süddeutsche Zeitung in Berlin, 29 November 2014 Tradition and innovation in monetary policy More than six years after the start of the global financial crisis, monetary policy in the euro area still faces major challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.68,0)">Monetary policy, the ECB, faces a challenge – perhaps more than ever before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.39,0)">It faces a challenge because inflation rates are too low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.81,0)">At 0.4% for the whole euro area, the inflation rate is well below our target of nearly 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.64,0)">The prospects for economic growth and further price developments in the medium term are subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.53,0)">Monetary growth and lending are weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.05,0)">Geopolitical risks are adding to the uncertainties which are causing investor appetite to continue to fall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Expectations of the ECB are high, from markets and from politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Every month people give us good advice, often referring to actions taken by other central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">And they do so despite the fact that our monetary policy decisions from June and September haven’t yet been able to fully take effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.02,0)">So what else can a central bank do in the current situation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">How innovative may central banks be?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">How innovative is an ECB allowed to be, which as a start-up from the year 1999 is in many ways itself an innovation, and as a custodian of a currency without a state can only partly be compared with other central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I think we can all readily agree that innovation cannot be an end in itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The ECB must and will act only in accordance with its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Price stability is the guiding principle of our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There can be no innovations in the definition of our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Moreover, in uncertain times of crisis a clear focus is not less, but doubly important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Central banks therefore have a particularly strong understanding of tradition, and for a good reason: monetary policy is all about trust, reliability and consistency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.27,0)">Innovative measures must therefore be judged against our mandate of maintaining and creating price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As with any decision, innovation demands a sober analysis of the costs and benefits, the opportunities and risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Allow me to slip briefly into legalese: innovative monetary policy measures, too, should be appropriate for their objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.61,0)">Since monetary policy measures also have side effects, a central bank should use the mildest measure that will have the least side effects – that measure must hence be necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.55,0)">Low inflation rates and the catalogue of measures So what does this mean for the current situation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Consistent monetary policy can and must maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">No more and no less.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">We are judged on whether we achieve an average rate of inflation for the euro area as a whole which is in line with our target of below, but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The commitment to price stability is symmetrical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">That means that the ECB must act in exactly the same way when the target is undershot for a sustained period as when it is overshot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">We take a medium-term view when it comes to achieving our target, because our aim is to ensure price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.99,0)">At the moment, with the aforementioned inflation rate of 0.4% for the whole euro area, we are a long way off our target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">And in the coming years, too, we can only expect a moderate rise in the inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There are a number of reasons why the challenges of monetary policy will probably continue to occupy us for quite some time to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.6,0)">Some banks will still have to adjust their balance sheets, and this applies to an even greater extent to public finances, private companies and households in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.49,0)">This has a structurally dampening effect on overall economic demand, and particularly on investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.46,0)">Furthermore, important long-term determinants of the real interest rate are pointing downwards: demographic trends, namely longer life expectancy and weak population growth worldwide – but particularly pronounced in the euro area – are creating an environment which necessitates low real interest rates and thus low balanced nominal interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.26,0)">The euro area suffers from a lack of competitiveness and productivity, which of course take different forms in individual Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.86,0)">Structural problems and current weak demand lead to unsatisfactory economic growth and unacceptably high unemployment in many countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.83,0)">Tackling these challenges is not the job of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Crisis management must tackle the root causes for the long term and we, the ECB, will therefore not tire of reminding governments that we can only provide them time for the urgently needed reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Against this backdrop we could ask whether it was appropriate that the ECB took action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I think it was, precisely because of the path of inflation – even if there is room for discussion about some of the measures and their design.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The list of our crisis management measures is long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.33,0)">In June and September this year we lowered key interest rates further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The main refinancing rate is now just 5 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.97,0)">The interest rate channel has thus been exhausted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">For the first time in our history we have resorted to a negative deposit rate in an effort to achieve the desired monetary policy accommodation within the tried and tested corridor system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.91,0)">This justified monetary policy step – which not least favours investment – was not an easy decision for us, for one because of its possible side effects for the financial sector and for savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">At the same time, we have the tool of forward guidance, which we have used and later reaffirmed: especially in view of the inflation outlook, we expect, on the basis of current data, that the central bank interest rates in the euro area will remain at the current level for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In addition we have taken a number of targeted unconventional measures which should improve the monetary policy transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">One of these is targeted longer-term refinancing operations  , with which banks can obtain liquidity for a fixed interest rate for up to four years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">We have drafted two purchase programmes, one for covered bonds and one for asset-backed securities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The purchase programme for covered bonds started in October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">So far purchases of around €16 billion have taken place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We started the ABS programme just last week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">I anticipate that together the longer-term refinancing operations and both purchase programmes will have a strong impact on the balance sheet of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Innovation or imitation Every month there are fresh calls for further measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But is it appropriate to contemplate further measures at this moment in time?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Under normal conditions, central banks are in a position to ensure price stability in an environment of positive nominal interest rates by means of conventional interest rate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.08,0)">Once interest rates are at zero, central banks are left with only unconventional measures in order to fulfil their mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.67,0)">Central banks all over the world have indeed been anything but inactive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In particular, they have significantly expanded their balance sheets, and by making changes in their balance sheet structure they have taken varied measures to make targeted interventions in submarkets affected by liquidity shortfalls, maintain important credit relationships and ensure a functioning monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">We, too, have turned to innovative measures, to the targeted longer-term refinancing operations and the purchase of covered bonds and asset-backed securities which I mentioned earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">For sure, in times such as these we need to be prepared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">That is why the ECB’s Governing Council agreed at the beginning of November that, looking ahead, it would closely monitor the appropriateness of its monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">In concrete terms, this means that if it should become necessary to further counteract the risks of a prolonged period of low inflation, the Governing Council intends to take additional unconventional measures within its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.51,0)">Even if it is good to be prepared, one should beware of showing activism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There is no automatic mechanism to initiate further programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The ECB’s Governing Council has not decided on a target for the size of the balance sheet; it has rather unanimously expressed an expectation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">A kind of mechanical expansion of the ECB’s balance sheet cannot be an end in itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">All of our decisions are to be evaluated against the background of current and medium-term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Consequently, we must continually analyse current price increases to identify the components which comprise the weaknesses in price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Short-term developments are not key, especially when they are largely determined by energy and food prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">The underlying trend and the firm anchoring of inflation expectations are decisive, as well as the focus on the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Low inflation rates in some Member States – even when negative – are not in themselves a breach of the target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">They can be necessary to restore lost competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.07,0)">One could also argue about whether it is really necessary to consider further measures given that the measures already taken have not yet been able to have an effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">Monetary policy does not take effect immediately, but only with a certain time lag.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As a rule we should take this time and wait and see.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.54,0)">The large-scale purchase of securities, including government bonds, is often seen as a panacea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As I said, for innovative measures too, the costs and benefits, and the opportunities and risks must be carefully considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Some central banks have used quantitative easing to quickly and decisively provide monetary policy impetus, adjusted to the specificities of their environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">We are particularly compared to these central banks and their measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.46,0)">For me, these are idle comparisons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The following saying applies here: those who constantly compare themselves with others might become more like them, but they won’t necessarily become any better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.29,0)">When making a comparison with the measures of other central banks, people often forget that innovative aspects of monetary policy need to be adapted to the institutional conditions, economic specifics and financing structure which characterise a currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.12,0)">Measures which are appropriate in one currency area can be ineffective elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What seems like the first option in one place may well be the very last resort elsewhere, without there being much difference in the actual aim of the measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Instead, we should ask: would such purchases have the desired effect on the rate of inflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">What “quantities” would need to be purchased to have an effect?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.16,0)">How long would such effects last?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The euro area is characterised by a bank-based financial system which makes it quite different from more strongly market-based financial systems, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This explains our focus on refinancing operations, which have enabled the banking system to overcome liquidity bottlenecks, maintain credit relationships and enter new credit arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Our measures from June and September 2014 also serve to support the credit channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">In essence, it is about improving funding conditions for borrowers in the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The selective purchase programmes for covered bonds and asset-backed securities follow the same logic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">For a broad securities purchasing programme, shouldn’t we also consider the fact that government securities in the euro area are not without credit risk?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.05,0)">In this respect, the interest on national government securities in the euro area doesn’t operate as a benchmark for all further interest rates on refinancing operations, as is the case in the United Kingdom or the United States for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.21,0)">Besides, the effect of intervening in capital markets in a bank-based financial system is weaker than in a market-based system, as illustrated by wealth effects, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Another consideration is that other central banks bought government securities in a different economic environment with considerably higher long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.59,0)">In the euro area, the long-term interest rates on Spanish and Italian government bonds, for example, are already lower than those of the United States or the United Kingdom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.55,0)">The Eurosystem is currently faced with 18, soon to be 19, issuers of government securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.19,0)">These securities bear different rates of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">There are very few shared competencies in fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.1,0)">As long as this is the case, the ECB’s purchase of government securities is inevitably linked to a serious incentive problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Therefore with regard to the purchase of government securities, measures which are obvious in one place could be the last resort at best for us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.08,0)">As you see, there are more questions than answers at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In my view, a consideration of the costs and benefits, and the opportunities and risks of a broad purchase programme of government bonds does not give a positive outcome at the current time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Today, less than a week before our ECB Governing Council meeting, I can of course only give you some general reflections from my personal point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Concluding remarks Owing to my position, I have limited myself today to talking about innovations in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Innovations in other political areas are also necessary, if not even more so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Innovative political approaches are called for when it comes to increasing growth potential in the euro area, strengthening economic adjustment efforts and reconciling fiscal consolidation with growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But let me conclude by returning to the original question: how innovative may the ECB’s monetary policy be?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">As innovative as necessary and as effective as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This requires careful consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The risks and side effects must always be taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As a lawyer I adhere to the principle of proportionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">For me, given the current situation, the hurdles for further measures are very high, especially for broad purchase programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.26,0)">The interest rates and spreads on many debt instruments are already very low: the risk of market distortions cannot be dismissed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The deciding factor for all programmes is their effectiveness for the real economy and ultimately for price stability, which is what we – the ECB as the central bank for the whole euro area – must be judged on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.46,0)">Innovation cannot be an end in itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.15,0)">At this point I would like to remind you that, since 2012, the financing costs for public borrowers have fallen significantly, as have those for large enterprises with direct access to the capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.85,0)">The reasons for weak growth and funding shortfalls primarily lie elsewhere, not in a lack of central bank liquidity, to say nothing of capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">At this point we should first look at the effect of our recent measures and of the asset quality review and the stress test on bank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The restoration to health of the banking system and the improvement of all credit and financing channels remains my priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I look forward to our discussion.</span>
