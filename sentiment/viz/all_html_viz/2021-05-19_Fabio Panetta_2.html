    <span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)"> At the edge of tomorrow: preparing the future of European retail payments Introductory remarks by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 14th Payment Forum of Suomen Pankki − Finlands Bank, Helsinki, 19 May 2021 Frankfurt am Main, 19 May 2021 Thank you for inviting me to speak at this fourteenth edition of the Payments Forum organised by Suomen Pankki – Finlands Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Finland is often seen as a forerunner in the development of retail payments, certainly when it comes to digitalisation and its effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">And I am pleased that despite the ongoing pandemic, we have come together as stakeholders of the payments ecosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Today, I would like to discuss how we can promote digital, European, instant retail payment solutions that can be used by everyone, everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Digital Digitalisation has indisputably come a long way in reshaping the European retail payments landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">So it is natural for digitalisation to be one of the starting points of our retail payments strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Simply put, digitalisation is changing the way we pay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">We are increasingly paying online and with cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The pandemic has further accelerated this trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.46,0)">In facing these developments, Europe is not optimally positioned, not least because of the “wait-and-see” attitude that has in some cases prevailed in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.16,0)">This has made Europe overly dependent on a few foreign providers for card and online payments, resulting in a high degree of market concentration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">European To increase choice, resilience and competitiveness, the European payments ecosystem must proactively stimulate competition, including by developing innovative, Europe-grown payment solutions and technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">For this reason, a key priority of our retail payments strategy is the development of a European payment solution for the point of interaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The ECB welcomed the launch of the European Payments Initiative  as its objectives meet our public interest criteria: pan-European reach and customer experience, convenience and cost efficiency, safety and efficiency, European brand and governance, and global acceptance as a longer-term goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">We remain open to other market initiatives, provided they meet these requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Instant Another key priority of our retail payments strategy is the full deployment of instant payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Here, too, the industry has a decisive role to play, facilitated or guided by the authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">On the operational side, the Eurosystem has taken steps to ensure the pan-European reach of instant payments by the end of 2021 through our TARGET instant payments settlement service  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.41,0)">But we know that the private sector, by contrast, has made far less progress on this front.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The next step is for payment service providers to offer instant payments at attractive and transparent conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This means that prices should be neither excessive nor hidden to consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.07,0)">While the cost for service providers of using TIPS is 0.20 eurocent   per instant payment transaction, instant payments are sometimes offered to consumers for €1 per transaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.34,0)">This must change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For instant payments to become the new normal, they must be cheap and easy to use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">We would also like to see providers make instant payments available on all commonly used electronic channels and offer much-desired functionalities such as Request-to-Pay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">For everyone, everywhere Our strategy goes further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Payments that cross the EU border must become cheaper, easier and faster.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">We thus contribute to the international work on cross-border payments, and we are exploring with Sveriges Riksbank how TIPS could support cross-currency instant payment transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">To promote innovation and digitalisation, we are also investigating the opportunities of pan-European electronic identities and electronic signatures for retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Finally, the strategy encompasses work on the environmental sustainability of payments and on access to payments for all citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">We are also preparing for the future through our work on a possible digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">A digital euro would provide Europeans cost-free access to a safe form of digital money which respects privacy and has legal tender status, ensuring it can be used everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Work is ongoing in cooperation between the ECB and the national central banks, including Suomen Pankii – Finlands Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The Eurosystem and the European Commission have outlined a clear vision of the future of retail payments  in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Digital, European, instant, for everyone, everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Together, we can make it happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">ECB  , “Implications of digitalisation in retail payments for the Eurosystem’s catalyst role”, July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">ECB  , “The Eurosystem’s retail payments strategy”, April.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">ECB  , “Study on the payment attitudes of consumers in the euro area  ”, December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">For example, the share of card payments with international card schemes rose from 53% to 69% of total card payment transactions in the EU between 2009 and 2018  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">POI, physical point of sale and mobile and e-commerce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">ECB  , “ECB welcomes initiative to launch new European payment solution”, Press release, 2 July.</span><span
