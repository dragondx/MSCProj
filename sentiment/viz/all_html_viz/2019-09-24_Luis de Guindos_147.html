    <span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)"> Frankfurt am Main, 24 September 2019 Concluding remarks Speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the ECB conference “Inflation in a changing economic environment” Introduction You have now been discussing issues related to inflation for two days, covering a wide variety of topics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Conferences of this kind are very helpful to us as central bankers, as they enable us to advance our thinking about policy-relevant questions, particularly if they are related to our core mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.93,0)">In concluding this conference, let me say a few words about economic slack in the euro area and the wage-inflation pass-through.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I think these are interesting topics at the moment, because, as you know, euro area inflation has been persistently low for several years, and more recently we have observed some decoupling of wage inflation from price inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.38,0)">Current situation Euro area consumer price inflation currently stands at 1%   and is thus considerably below our inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.15,0)">Unfortunately, this low inflation has been a persistent phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.34,0)">Since November 2011, when euro area inflation peaked at 3%  , the average rate has been less than 1.2% per annum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.8,0)">Long-term inflation expectations are also low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.6,0)">Market-based indicators are stagnating at historically low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.09,0)">The five-year five-year inflation-linked swap rate has been hovering around 1.25% in recent weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.25,0)">Survey-based measures have also fallen recently, to 1.7%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">While these numbers are higher than those for market-based indicators, we shouldn’t take comfort from them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.68,0)">International evidence shows that survey expectations can react very slowly to persistently low inflation  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.47,0)">Wage inflation, on the other hand, has behaved quite differently to consumer price inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.25,0)">Since 2017, wage inflation, as measured by compensation per employee, has overtaken consumer price inflation, peaking at 2.4% in the third quarter of 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">These developments raise important questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.29,0)">Is the euro area economy hitting its capacity constraints?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.49,0)">Or is there still economic slack that is holding headline inflation down?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.92,0)">How will wage inflation pass through to price inflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.03,0)">How to measure economic slack There are signs of a tight labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.37,0)">In addition to the wage dynamics I just mentioned, we have observed the unemployment rate moving close to its pre-crisis low, with participation rates being higher than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.1,0)">At the same time, assessing the tightness in labour markets is not straightforward, for several reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.2,0)">First, these aggregate statistics hide substantial cross-country heterogeneity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.45,0)">Second, and more fundamentally, the natural rate of unemployment is unobservable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.52,0)">Furthermore, tightness in the labour market provides only a partial picture of slack in the economy, as slack can vary across different parts of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.27,0)">It is therefore risky to infer it from just a few economic variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.6,0)">And for each measure of slack the same issue applies as for slack in the labour market: it cannot be observed directly, because the potential   levels of economic variables are unobservable and time-varying.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.56,0)">Accordingly, there are various estimates of the aggregate slack and these estimates differ from one another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.83,0)">Some of them are also subject to substantial ex post revisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">For all of these reasons, we need to be cautious when assessing economic slack and look at many economic indicators to achieve a robust assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.29,0)">The wage-inflation pass-through Let us turn to the wage-inflation pass-through.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Given the recent growth of wages, it is crucial to understand how this will pass through to inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But coming to a robust assessment is not straightforward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Both economic theory and the empirical evidence tell us that this pass-through depends on many different factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">One consideration is that the structure of the economy is not constant over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Over the past few decades, we have been witnessing gradual changes in the economic environment, many of which can be traced back to the ongoing IT revolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">These changes have important implications for inflation and pass-through, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">One such change is the growth of e-commerce, or, as some call it, the “Amazon effect”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Many commentators argue that increased price transparency when shopping online has contributed to keeping inflation low in advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.21,0)">Whether the growth of e-commerce makes prices less responsive to wages is more debatable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Research suggests that the algorithmic pricing technologies of online retailers make retail prices more sensitive to aggregate, economy-wide shocks – which would imply that pass-through should eventually occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.59,0)">However, while the optimistic view is that e-commerce, and the IT revolution more generally, contributes to more competition and economic dynamism, there are also concerns about its more pernicious longer-term effects, such as: rising market concentration, a falling labour share and slower long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.24,0)">One of the factors behind these negative effects is that IT makes it easier for highly productive “superstar” firms to expand into new markets, generating efficiency gains in the short run, but leading to more concentration in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">A more general trend leading in the same direction is the rise of intangible inputs, such as brands, software, technologies and databases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Investment in these types of input is steadily increasing as a share of overall investment, and they are becoming increasingly important for firms’ success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The key feature of intangible inputs is that they can be deployed on a larger scale at almost zero additional cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In other words, they primarily contribute to firms’ fixed costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.79,0)">The increase in the role of fixed costs and the diminishing role of variable costs can have important implications for the structure of an industry: these changes contribute to an increase in concentration, a long-term decline in productivity   and a fall in the labour share.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.7,0)">The lesson for our discussion is that the rise of intangibles implies that marginal costs   may be playing a decreasing role in price-setting decisions, thereby leading to a lower wage-inflation pass-through.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.86,0)">Some theories suggest that the wage-inflation pass-through might also fluctuate depending on the level of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">They start from the empirical observation that, at lower levels of inflation, price fluctuations are less persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In such an environment, firms are less inclined to match cost increases with price increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Hence, low inflation leads to lower pass-through and a reduction in the expected persistence of cost and price changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.12,0)">Turning to the euro area data, we can observe that the recent decoupling of wages and prices is not unprecedented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We have seen a similar decoupling before, in 1999-2000 and in 2005-06.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.66,0)">Formal econometric exercises confirm this observation and suggest that the wage-inflation pass-through is state-dependent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.55,0)">One finding is that the pass-through depends on the type of shock hitting the economy: it is stronger for demand shocks, and weaker for supply shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Another finding that is particularly relevant now and confirms the theories I have just discussed, is that the pass-through is lower in times of low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.88,0)">Other research has also found that the pass-through is lower in times of economic slack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Conclusion To sum up, the current low unemployment rate and the recent wage increases do not necessarily imply that higher inflation is around the corner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.24,0)">First, measuring economic slack is fraught with well-known difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.38,0)">Second, both theory and empirical studies suggest that the wage-inflation pass-through varies over time and depends on many factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.51,0)">Arguably, the structural changes under way in advanced economies imply that the pass-through may be on the decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The bottom line is that monetary policy decisions need to be based on a wide array of economic indicators, not just the unemployment rate and wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I have touched upon some of the economic effects of the IT revolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">While there might be dangers ahead, I have no doubt that, with appropriate regulation, this revolution will contribute to growth and prosperity in Europe and the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It will also change the way we work in central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">We are actively trying to foster this change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.55,0)">For alternative estimates of the euro
