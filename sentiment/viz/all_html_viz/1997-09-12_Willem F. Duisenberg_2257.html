    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)"> From the EMI to the ESCB: Achievements and challenges Speech delivered by Dr. W. F. Duisenberg,President of the European Monetary Instituteat a luncheon organised in conjunction withthe Luxembourg Bankers' Association and the International Bankers Clubin Luxembourg on 12 September 1997 It is a great pleasure to be here today to speak to you about the progress that has been made in respect of the transition to Stage Three of European Economic and Monetary Union   and some of the challenges that lie ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The European Monetary Institute  , established under the Maastricht Treaty, has been assigned an important role in the transition to Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Located in Frankfurt, it came into being on 1 January 1994, its members being the central banks of the EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">The three main tasks of the EMI are to further strengthen co-operation among the national central banks and the co-ordination of national monetary policies with the aim of ensuring price stability; to provide advice to the EU Council regarding the achievement of a high degree of sustainable convergence by Member States adopting the single currency; and to undertake the necessary technical preparations required for EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The European Central Bank   will be established by the appointment of its President and other members of the Executive Board after the decision is taken on which countries will participate initially in Monetary Union, and will, in conjunction with the national central banks  , form the European System of Central Banks  , which will take on responsibility for monetary policy within the euro area from the beginning of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.41,0)">By then, the EMI will have been liquidated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In considering the achievements and challenges on the way to Monetary Union I should like to focus my remarks on two issues which are at the forefront of the tasks of the EMI; first, and very briefly, the progress and challenges with respect to convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Second, the state of preparations for the introduction of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">PROGRESS TOWARDS CONVERGENCE In the area of convergence, a key challenge facing the European Union is the selection of the countries which will be deemed eligible to participate in Monetary Union from 1 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">As you are no doubt aware, the Treaty provides that no Member State can enter EMU unless the Heads of State or Government conclude that it fulfils the necessary conditions to do so in terms of attaining a high degree of sustainable convergence as indicated by price stability, the sustainability of fiscal positions, exchange rate stability and the convergence of long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In this context, let me say that I do not intend - and I am sure you would not expect me - to discuss the probability of individual Member States participating in EMU from the outset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The EMI will give its views on this subject in due course as, under the Maastricht Treaty, it is required to provide a report on convergence to the EU Council in the spring of next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">I am, however, happy to discuss the current situation in relation to the convergence criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In short, there has been a considerable measure of achievement in some areas, notably in the progress towards price stability, while some challenges still remain, particularly in the fiscal area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">With regard to inflation, Member States have made remarkable progress in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">As measured by both the national Consumer Price Indices   and the recently introduced Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices  , the weighted average annual rate of inflation in the EU currently stands at 1.7%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Not only has such a subdued rate of price increases not been achieved for decades, but there are also few signs of incipient price pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.9,0)">Furthermore, differences in inflation rates among Member States have declined substantially: almost all Member States currently have HICP inflation rates of around 2% or less.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Reflecting the pattern of economic convergence in actual and expected inflation, and credible monetary policies, intra-EU exchange rate stability has been broadly maintained during the first half of 1997, while long-term interest rates are low and long-term interest rate differentials have narrowed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.24,0)">The fiscal situation is less bright.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Most countries exceeded the reference values of the Treaty in 1996 and had yet to ensure sustainable consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">In May, the ECOFIN Council sent recommendations to correct excessive deficits to all Member States with the exception of Denmark, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Finland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This points to the crucial need to ensure sustainable convergence in the fiscal field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Notably, it is quite evident that sustainable consolidation cannot be achieved by one-off and accounting measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.94,0)">Looking ahead to the medium term, it is necessary to address the issue of the future liabilities of social security systems in the context of an ageing population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In the absence of appropriate reforms, sizable increases in contributions, or even substantial increases in government indebtedness, would appear to be in prospect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is of particular importance as fiscal discipline is essential not only at the time of entering EMU but also thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">I would acknowledge that the fiscal stance has generally been tightened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.73,0)">The government deficit for the EU as a whole is forecast, according to the European Commission, the IMF and the OECD, to decline from 4.4% of GDP in 1996 to around 2.9-3.0% in 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">For the EU as a whole, the debt ratio was estimated to have risen further in 1996, to 73.2%, but is generally projected to fall slightly in 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Needless to say, the projections have yet to be confirmed by outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Besides fulfilment of the convergence criteria, there are also a number of other significant challenges in the economic environment; in particular, there is a clear and insistent need for structural adjustment, notably in labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.59,0)">The Union does not have a good record in terms of job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.47,0)">Unemployment in most Member States, though showing signs of stabilising, remains high, and the situation in labour markets is forecast to remain highly unsatisfactory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.57,0)">A wide range of institutional rigidities account for the weak employment performance, and it will be a major challenge to tackle them in a decisive manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Of course, continued cost moderation is also required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">I welcome the importance that has been attached to the issue of labour markets by the Council, in particular the Resolution on growth and employment passed at Amsterdam in June this year and the initiative for an extraordinary meeting of the European Council this autumn under the Luxembourg Presidency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">PREPARATIONS FOR THE CONDUCT OF THE SINGLE MONETARY POLICY From the issue of economic convergence, let me now turn to the technical preparations for the conduct of a single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The EMI is responsible for preparing the operational framework that will enable the ESCB to perform its tasks in Stage Three: preparatory work that is progressing according to schedule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The conceptual phase has been completed for all the main issues of relevance and the main challenge now is for the EMI   to ensure that the options which have been selected are designed in full detail, and that they are prepared and tested in due time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The framework, as prepared by the EMI, will be submitted to the ECB for decision after its establishment in 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me mention a number of the areas where the EMI is involved in preparations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">I shall try, in particular, to provide you with a guide to the progress that has been made more recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The EMI continues to focus on a wide range of issues, such as monetary policy strategies, the instruments and procedures necessary for conducting a single monetary policy, foreign exchange issues, the integration of national payment systems through TARGET, the issuance of euro banknotes, statistical issues relating to the conduct of a common monetary policy, the rules for operations of NCBs within the framework of the ESCB, and the structure and functions of the ECB/ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">First, let me remind you that the EMI published an assessment of alternative monetary policy strategies in February this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The Treaty provides unambiguous guidance as to the ultimate objective: "the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.9,0)">However, in pursuing this objective, the ESCB, like all central banks, will face a complex transmission process from policy actions to price developments with long and variable lags.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Thus, policy decisions directed at price stability must be both pre-emptive and forward-looking, taking into account all relevant information regarding the prospective evolution of prices, and taking appropriate and timely action to ensure that the final objective is achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">In addition, the need for credibility and consistency of the decision-making process over time will require the ESCB to establish a clear framework to guide the use of its monetary policy instruments with a view to achieving its final objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The document to which I am referring   identified two potential candidate strategies, namely monetary targeting and direct inflation targeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Overall, it concluded that the similarities in the behaviour of those central banks that pursue these two strategies are greater than the differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Regardless of their choice of strategy, they all monitor a wide and similar set of economic and financial variables as indicators in determining the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The ESCB will face two particular challenges from the outset when implementing a monetary policy strategy for Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">First, the ESCB will have no track record of its own and must, therefore, attach the utmost importance to establishing and maintaining a high degree of credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Second, the transition to Stage Three will constitute a major shift in regime, which will imply initial uncertainty concerning economic and financial conditions and developments in the euro area as well as the future relationships between major macroeconomic variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It will not be easy for the Governing Council of the ECB to draw firm conclusions from the observation of indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Moreover, while the stance of the single monetary policy of the ESCB can only be set to ensure that it will be appropriate for the euro area as a whole, it will nevertheless be important for the ESCB to be fully aware of any differential impact of its policies across Member States due to remaining structural differences across countries, not least because inflation in an individual Member State may spill over into the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In order to implement its monetary policy strategy, the ESCB will need to rely on a set of monetary policy instruments and procedures - its operational framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The EMI Council has defined a set of monetary policy instruments that will be made available to the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In January of this year the EMI published a report entitled "The single monetary policy in Stage Three: specification of the operational framework".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The aim of the report was to provide information to the public on the operational aspects of the ESCB's monetary policy, including the main features of the instruments, procedures and supporting functions which were being prepared by the EMI.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Briefly, it is envisaged that the ESCB will mainly use open market operations, in most cases employing reverse transactions, but that it will also offer two standing facilities  , and a broad range of counterparties will have access to ESCB operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Preparations have also been made for an infrastructure that will allow the ESCB, if it so chooses, to impose minimum reserve requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The ECB will decide in 1998 whether to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Required reserves could be used mainly to stabilise money market interest rates and to create or enlarge a structural liquidity shortage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">The EMI has seen a need to study further the extension of the relevant article of the ESCB/ECB Statute to allow the ECB to subject a broader range of financial institutions than credit institutions alone to reserve requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The EMI plans to publish a further report in the near future on the subject of monetary policy instruments and procedures, the so-called "General documentation", which updates the operational framework, taking account of the progress made in the specification of the ESCB's monetary policy instruments and procedures over the past few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This new report is intended particularly to provide financial institutions with the information they need to prepare themselves to participate in ESCB monetary policy operations in Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In this respect, the report sets out the criteria to be fulfilled by financial institutions to be eligible counterparties in ESCB monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It then presents the features of the different types of open market operations which might be conducted by the ESCB   and those of the ESCB's two standing facilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The report will contain a detailed description of the procedures related to the various types of operations and, furthermore, it will specify the eligibility criteria and risk control measures to be applied to assets underlying the ESCB's liquidity-providing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It will also present the features of the ESCB's minimum reserves system as prepared by the EMI.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Of course, the final decision on the operational framework will be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB after its establishment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.62,0)">The Governing Council, consisting of the Executive Board of the ECB together with the Governors of each of the participating Member States' central banks, may choose not to use all the options made available in the General documentation, or may decide to amend certain features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Next week the EMI also plans to publish a provisional list of Monetary Financial Institutions  , primarily for the use of reporting institutions and compilers of statistics, in support of its aim to produce a homogeneous monetary sector and reporting population for the production of properly articulated money and banking statistics in Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.89,0)">This report will cover credit institutions but not Money Market Funds  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Work is under way to identify Money Market Funds in the EU for inclusion in an Addendum to the present provisional list, which it is planned to make available later in the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Another important aspect of the EMI's work relates to legal convergence, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">the adaptation of national legislation including the statutes of the NCBs, with a view to Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Member States are obliged, in accordance with the Maastricht Treaty, to eliminate incompatibilities between national legislation and the Treaty and ESCB/ECB Statute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The EMI has considered this earlier in both its 1995 and 1996 Annual Reports, distinguishing between central bank independence, the integration of NCBs in the ESCB and legislation other than the statutes of the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Recent work has built on these earlier reports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Given that not all Member States are likely to participate from the start of Stage Three, the exchange rate relationship between the euro area and the non-euro area EU countries will be of great importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The EMI has finalised the first stage of its preparatory work on the future monetary and exchange rate relationships between the euro area and other EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The outline of a new mechanism   was approved in Amsterdam in June of this year and includes the following features: it will be based on central rates, defined vis-à-vis the euro for non-euro area currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">A standard fluctuation band will be established for these currencies around their central rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">The margins of the standard fluctuation band will be relatively wide: +/- 15%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Central rates and the standard wide band will be set by mutual agreement between the ECB, the Ministers of the euro area Member States and Ministers and Governors of the central banks of the non-euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.27,0)">The ECB will have the right to initiate a realignment and the possibility of suspending intervention and financing if these were to threaten the pursuit of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The ERM II does not rule out forms of closer exchange rate co-operation between non-euro area NCBs and the ECB agreed on a case-by-case basis, such as narrower fluctuation bands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The integration of payment systems is an essential element of the technical preparations for Stage Three, in order to facilitate the implementation of the ESCB's monetary policy, and to provide sound and efficient mechanisms to settle same-day cross-border payments under any circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In March 1995 the EMI Council agreed to establish the TARGET system; the TARGET Report was released in May 1995 and a first progress report in August 1996, providing additional information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Further work in this field has focused on elaborating the organisational aspects of TARGET, the technical implementation of the system and legal issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">For instance, in February this year the EMI Council endorsed the decision to choose S.W.I.F.T.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">as the Interlinking network provider and a contract was finalised in June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Testing of NCB links with the EMI's test centre has begun.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">An ECB Payment Mechanism   is also being prepared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">It has been decided that the ECB will have a direct link to the Interlinking, in the same way as the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The EMI will be publishing a second progress report shortly, covering detailed issues such as the harmonisation of the operating time of domestic RTGS systems linked to TARGET, pricing policy and the provision of intraday liquidity to non-euro area NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.97,0)">It is proposed that there should only be two common days when TARGET is closed: Christmas Day and New Year's Day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.02,0)">On other days the TARGET system will remain open, but individual NCBs will have the flexibility to close on national or regional holidays.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The Interlinking system will remain open as long as at least two national RTGS systems are open.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.94,0)">Normal TARGET operating hours will be from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. "ECB time"  , although some flexibility could be left to NCBs to open earlier for domestic reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">On the issue of pricing, it has been agreed by the EMI Council that a common transaction fee for cross-border TARGET transfers should be charged, based on the principle of full cost recovery  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The EMI is intending to publish a price range, but the exact fees will be decided by the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">There has also been progress with respect to options for preventing intraday credit, if provided to non-euro area NCBs, from spilling over into overnight credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.76,0)">One of the options is for an earlier cut-off time for these NCBs connected to TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It has been decided that if this option were to be chosen, the earlier closing time would only need to apply to the use of intraday credit in euro  , rather than to the processing of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">During the first half of this year, the EMI opened a dialogue with EU-wide banking and financial associations on issues concerning their preparation for the changeover to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In March, the EMI and the representatives of the banking community agreed a list of priorities for preparatory work to be accomplished during the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">At the request of the banking industry, the EMI supported the private sector's preparations by defining common standards for the computation of interest rates in the money market, the method of quotation of the exchange rate of the foreign currencies against the euro and the definition of euro area-wide business days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The EMI invited the banking and financial community to take a lead in harmonizing other market conventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This lead ten EU-wide banking associations and two International Central Securities Depositories   to submit to the EMI a "joint statement on market conventions for the euro".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This statement is a non-binding catalogue of market standards which are proposed by the signatory associations to issuers of financial instruments and other market participants for inclusion in new wholesale financial products after the start of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The statement proposes that, after the start of Stage Three, newly issued instruments in the euro financial markets should reflect minimum standards of harmonisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The EMI has welcomed and supported the initiative taken by the associations of the banking and financial industry, which reflects a broad consensus among market participants on common conventions for the euro financial markets, and is of the view that implementation of these conventions will enhance the integration of, and greater transparency in, the euro financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In discussions with the EMI, representatives of some EU-wide banking associations have also stressed that they would favour the ESCB participating in a neutral manner in the calculation of an overnight reference rate to be used in the context of derivatives contracts for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.24,0)">Originally, the EMI Council was of the opinion that it should not interfere in what is essentially a matter for the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">However, the market has indicated to the EMI its difficulties in calculating this reference rate itself and, given the need to ensure the continuity of contracts, the Council has reconsidered and has agreed to assist in the calculation of this rate, although it will not take responsibility for its publication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Finally, let me come to the topic of the ESCB itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The main issues outstanding as regards the degree of centralisation and decentralisation of operations within the ESCB have now been agreed upon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.17,0)">One significant challenge confronting the EMI and the NCBs in the coming months will be to determine the functions and the structure of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Significant thought has been given to these issues within the EMI, and the EMI Council has given serious consideration to staffing requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.27,0)">I regard it likely that just under 500 staff members will be required initially; the current staff at the EMI numbers less than 350.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Given the lead times needed to recruit suitably qualified staff, this process will begin in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Further consideration is being given to institutional issues, in particular the form of co-operation between the ECB and the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Although there are some specific responsibilities assigned to the different bodies within the ESCB, there will also need to be close co-operation between them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">The experience to date with sub-committees and working groups of central bank experts meeting under the auspices of the EMI suggests that this could form a useful basis for such co-operation in Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">CONCLUSION To conclude, EU Member States have made considerable progress in terms of economic convergence, although challenges remain in terms of structural reforms, notably in the area of fiscal policy and labour and product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Considerable progress has also been made by the EMI in terms of the necessary preparations for the introduction of the single currency on schedule on 1 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">The greatest challenge that lies ahead is to establish and maintain a zone of price stability within the euro area after the start of Stage Three, in fulfilment of the clear mandate given to the ECB in the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Personally, I am convinced that the application of the convergence criteria, the institutional arrangements for the ESCB and the preparations that have been made to date will ensure that the euro will be a stable currency and that the ESCB will be a powerful institution, safeguarding the value of the new currency./.</span>
