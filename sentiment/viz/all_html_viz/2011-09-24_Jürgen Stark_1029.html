    <h2> Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB at the 13th Annual Emerging Markets Conference 2011 Washington, 24 September 2011 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jürgen Stark </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)"> The global financial crisis and the role of monetary policy Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the 13th Annual Emerging Markets Conference 2011Washington, 24 September 2011 Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to address this distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.79,0)">Looking back over time, we see that the role and conduct of monetary policy has often changed in response to economic and financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In fact, the international central banking community has always been eager to learn from past developments and experiences, also with respect to different experiences across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.1,0)">Of course, this does not imply that monetary policy in the past has always been the same everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.8,0)">Certainly, differences exist in the way monetary policy is conducted across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">But it is precisely because of the open-mindedness in discussing and the willingness to learn from each others’ experiences during the past century that monetary policy making went through an evolutionary process: an evolutionary process that improved the conduct of monetary policy over time and led to a great deal of convergence across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me in my remarks briefly review this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I will then discuss the specific lessons that we can learn from the recent episode of financial and economic turbulence, and conclude with the challenges ahead not only for monetary policy, but also for economic policies more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It was in response to the major bank panics of the first half of the nineteenth century that the Bank of England adopted the “responsibility doctrine” proposed by Walter Bagehot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.92,0)">This required the Bank to lend freely on the basis of any sound collateral, but at a penalty rate to prevent moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Half a century later, the Federal Reserve System was established in the United States in response to frequent banking crises, in particular the crisis of 1907, to serve as a lender of last resort similar to the Bank of England.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Under the gold standard gold convertibility served as the economy’s nominal anchor and was used as a way to ensure trust in a currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.39,0)">Before the establishment of central banks, private banks and governments issuing banknotes had often overextended their gold reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In a sense, early central banks were strongly committed to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.6,0)">However, from the 1920s onwards many central banks fell under public control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.74,0)">The Great Depression led to a major reaction against central banks, which were accused of exacerbating the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In virtually every country, monetary policy was placed under the control of the Treasury and fiscal policy became dominant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In many countries, central banks followed a low interest rate policy to both stimulate the economy and to help the Treasury in marketing its debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In the 1950s independent monetary policy making by central banks was restored, and this was accompanied by a brief period of price stability until the mid 1960s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.99,0)">The belief that unemployment could be permanently reduced at the expense of higher inflation resulted in very accommodative monetary policy in the 1970s, which led to an increase in inflation as inflation expectations started to rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.0,0)">Only a few countries, such as Germany, were an exception to this rule, as the Bundesbanks’s emphasis on monetary aggregates resulted in a much tighter monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">By the end of the 1970s, central banks put renewed emphasis on credibility and started to tighten monetary policy so that inflation decreased significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In many countries central banks were granted independence and were given a mandate to keep inflation low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As a result, stable prices have become a fact of life for billions of people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.78,0)">Today we are experiencing the worst economic and financial crisis of the post-war period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">I am convinced that the knowledge gained as a result will again change and further sharpen the way we conduct monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">So let me now share with you some thoughts on the direction in which I expect - and hope - monetary policy thinking to change in response to the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The role of monetary policy and lessons from the financial crisis I think it is fair to say that there was a widespread consensus over some key elements of the pre-crisis monetary policy paradigm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">In particular, against the background of the high inflation experience of the 1970s in many industrialised countries, the central bank consensus comprised three key elements: Central bank independence as a corner stone for an effective monetary policy; Price stability as the primary objective of central banks; and Solidly anchored inflation expectations on the basis of transparent communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In addition, not least against the background of the “Great Moderation”, that is, the period of low inflation and macroeconomic stability in most industrialised countries which was observed during the 20 years before the crisis, the central bank consensus also emphasised three elements, to which the ECB has never subscribed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">These are: Monetary policy has a primary role in the management of aggregate demand in the short-run; Money and credit indicators can be disregarded; Monetary policy should react to asset price busts; not to asset price booms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Let me discuss how I see these elements from today’s perspective, particularly in the context of the recent experience of the global financial and economic crisis, and draw conclusions with regard to the usefulness of these elements for the future conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Let me start with my general conclusion: In my view, the first three elements have proven to be very valuable assets during the crisis and I view them as absolutely essential to the success of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The latter three elements of this consensus should be seriously reconsidered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">I think the crisis has made a convincing case for a more medium term orientation of monetary policy, which takes into account information in money and credit indicators, and which tries to lean against the wind as financial imbalances start to develop and pose risks to price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Let me now elaborate on the above elements and draw some conclusions: Firstly, the crisis has – in my view - crucially underlined the importance of central bank independence as a corner stone of credible and effective monetary policy making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Of course, central bank independence is a precondition of effective monetary policy at all times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.7,0)">It is an important lesson which is not only evidenced by events in the history of central banking, but also by the academic literature, that any blurring of responsibilities can potentially lead to a loss of credibility for the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.2,0)">Such a situation would ultimately undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The effectiveness of monetary policy on the basis of institutional and operational independence was, however, fundamental during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">During the turbulent market conditions that we experienced central banks had to implement extraordinary measures, both in terms of reducing policy rates to levels that are unprecedented, and in terms of unconventional liquidity measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.77,0)">If these measures – untested as they are – are to be expected to exert any impact on economic decisions, they have to be seen by market participants as the result of an autonomous decision by the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">They have to be seen as consistent with its overall policy framework, rather than as the result of pressures from fiscal authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The reason is simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.36,0)">If a central bank comes under pressure in times of crisis, and succumbs to that pressure, it is very unlikely to exit from such extraordinary measures in a timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.8,0)">This may unanchor inflation expectations and thus undermine the effectiveness of the measures implemented during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Secondly, regarding the objective of price stability and the anchoring of inflation expectations, the crisis taught us that well-anchored inflation expectations can act as an automatic stabiliser when uncertainty becomes destabilising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This is always true, in good times as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In fact, well-anchored inflation expectations in the euro area were instrumental in avoiding large interest rate hikes before the crisis, when commodity prices rose sharply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.07,0)">At the height of the crisis, they became a policy instrument in their own right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Thanks to well-anchored inflation expectations we could avoid deflationary spirals and real interest rates could be reduced in tandem with nominal rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It is noteworthy that if inflation expectations are well anchored, and are not affected by transient shocks to actual inflation, there is no need to manipulate monetary policy frameworks: there is no need to increase the inflation target as a means of resisting deflationary risks in times of macroeconomic distress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.23,0)">Opportunistic manipulations of the monetary policy framework of course damage the foundations on which that framework rests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">So, being able to rely on the stabilising effect of inflation expectations is clearly a preferable option.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.71,0)">Let me now turn to the elements of the consensus that are, from the perspective of the ECB, somewhat more controversial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.75,0)">Firstly, the crisis has demonstrated that a monetary policy aimed at fine-tuning short-term objectives carries serious risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Before the crisis, there was a widely-held conviction that monetary policy could focus more on short term demand management because inflation was firmly under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Proponents of this view found support in the phenomenon of the “Great Moderation” observed in the twenty years before the crisis, a time of widespread macroeconomic stability and low inflation in most industrialised countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.66,0)">Nonetheless, there were clear signs – and also warnings - that this short-term orientation could have negative side effects in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.17,0)">As you know, these side effects manifested themselves in a spectacular build-up of monetary and financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Although monetary policy frameworks oriented towards the medium term could probably not have completely prevented the current crisis, I am convinced that they would have helped to make it less disruptive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.86,0)">Typically, policies of short-term demand management rely heavily on inflation forecasts and output gap measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.42,0)">Experience, especially prior to the crisis, has revealed the risks of constructing policy on indicators and variables which are not sufficiently robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.05,0)">Let me take the output gap as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.08,0)">As the literature has clearly shown, the empirical proxies used to capture the output gap are subject to constant revisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.16,0)">Policy-makers who base their decisions mainly on such assessments of the cyclical position can be led very much astray.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.03,0)">For instance, The Great Inflation of the 1970s occurred, to a large extent, due to measurement errors in the real-time estimates of the output gap combined with an overreaction to output gap measures when assessing the state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Arguably, the same can be said of the low interest rates implemented for a prolonged period in the middle of the previous decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.7,0)">Monetary policies aimed at fine-tuning short-term objectives also run a serious risk of inducing too much policy forbearance for too long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.25,0)">Exiting an extraordinary accommodative mode too late can sow the seeds of future imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.42,0)">As the economy recovers from an exceptionally deep recession, real time output gap estimates and estimates of structural unemployment or the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment   are particularly uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.88,0)">Potential output is likely to have fallen for a variety of reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.95,0)">This could be due to a mismatch between the skills of workers that lose their jobs and the skills required in new vacancies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.68,0)">Another phenomenon is that economic growth after a financial crisis tends to be much slower due to the debt overhang.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.16,0)">While emphasis on measures of the output gap can give the impression that output could be increased by monetary means, it becomes an illusion if the problem is due to a mismatch of skills or a debt overhang.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.02,0)">Only structural policies can address these problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.23,0)">Second, with respect to the claim that money and credit do not matter for successful monetary policy making, the experiences of the past three years have proven that this conventional wisdom is simply wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">By including an analysis of money and credit developments in their monetary policy strategy, central banks can ensure that important information stemming from money and credit, typically neglected in conventional cyclical forecasting models of the economy, is considered in the formulation of monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">There is compelling empirical evidence showing that, at low frequencies - that is over medium to longer-term horizons - inflation shows a robust positive association with money growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Monitoring credit growth can also be useful in identifying other sources of unsustainable credit developments, even if some of them cannot necessarily be eliminated by monetary policy tools, and would instead require action of a macro-prudential nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">After years of oblivion, macroeconomic theory seems to have caught up with reality and shifted its attention to credit and leverage as critical parameters that a central bank should consult regularly to measure the pulse of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.8,0)">The ECB had consistently used these indicators even when they were derided as relics of a defunct monetary doctrine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">They proved useful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.98,0)">They gave information about financing conditions and the financial structure, as well as about the condition and behaviour of banks, when these sources of information were critical to the assessment of the health of the transmission mechanism and, more broadly, the state of the business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">This dimension of monetary analysis has proven particularly valuable in shaping the ECB’s response to the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.46,0)">There is indeed evidence in support of the fact that, without duly taking monetary analysis into account, inflation in the euro area would have been distinctly higher at times of financial exuberance and would have fallen deep into negative territory in the wake of the financial markets’ collapse, starting in the autumn of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.84,0)">The economy as a whole would have been more volatile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.35,0)">And thirdly, with regard to the pre-crisis consensus on monetary policy not to act on asset price bubbles, the crisis has vividly demonstrated that bursting asset price bubbles can be extremely costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.58,0)">The public policy response to the crisis has - even when being successful in attenuating the immediate impact of a financial crisis on the real economy - carried substantial fiscal costs and has led to significant output losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.89,0)">To confine ourselves to “ex-post” policies is, therefore, not enough and calls for effective “ex-ante” policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The main policy tools in this regard are, of course, appropriate regulatory and supervisory policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.98,0)">Before the crisis, these preventive tools were insufficient to deal with the build up of asset price imbalances in the pre-crisis period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Lessons have been learned, and with the re-design of the supervisory architecture in many countries around the world, and the Basel III regulatory reforms, enhanced preventive tools are underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">But also from a monetary policy perspective, greater emphasis on “ex-ante” prevention is warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.74,0)">To the extent that financial imbalances are accompanied by excessive monetary and credit growth with possible implications for the medium term outlook on inflation, central banks do indeed have an obligation to take appropriate action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">With respect to the ECB, our focus on medium term definitions of price stability, as well as the use of money and credit in our monetary pillar, already provides some ‘leaning’ against the build up of asset price imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Therefore, in my view, a cautious leaning against excessive money and credit growth and building up of financial imbalances as part of our general monetary policy framework cannot only contribute to financial stability, but most importantly to achieve our primary objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Let me now turn to the economic challenges lying ahead of us, and the role monetary policy should play in overcoming these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The challenges ahead and the role for monetary policy The global financial crisis is far from over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.29,0)">By now the global financial crisis has gone through a number of different phases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.91,0)">Initially the crisis started in the sub-prime mortgage market during the summer of 2007, and became very intense in September 2008 with the default of Lehman Brothers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.06,0)">Subsequently, financial woes spilled over into the real economy, resulting in recessions in almost all industrialised countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.01,0)">Monetary and fiscal policy countered this with unprecendented vigour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Monetary policy responded with very low interest rates and a wide range of non-standard measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Fiscal policy allowed public deficits to widen and set up rescue packages for troubled financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">To a large extent thanks to these measures, economic activity rebounded in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.08,0)">But at the same time, countries that had entered the financial crisis with large public and private debt burdens started to have serious problems accessing sovereign debt markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.11,0)">In 2011 the tensions in sovereign debt markets intensified further due to increasing concerns about long-term debt sustainability in various parts of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.77,0)">These developments have further threatened financial stability as financial institutions hold a significant share of troubled countries’ government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Here, the onus is clearly on governments to engage in the necessary fiscal corrections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.83,0)">However, this does not only mean exiting from the fiscal stimulus and support measures taken in response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Even with these measures reversed, fiscal policy still faces at least three important challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.29,0)">First, excluding crisis-related stimulus measures, most advanced economies are still left with historically high deficit-to-GDP ratios, which, in the context of today, are largely structural in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.46,0)">To put it another way, given the lower actual and potential post-crisis output and correspondingly lower post-crisis tax revenues, pre-crisis spending levels are no longer affordable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.7,0)">Secondly, government debt-to-GDP ratios are now much higher than before the crisis, and the guarantees provided to the financial sector have added to the potential liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.92,0)">Thirdly, over the next two to three decades, governments face rising costs related to ageing populations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Due to the combination of these factors, questions are - unsurprisingly - being asked about the ability of some governments to bring their public finances onto a sustainable path over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In this regard, let me point out that the state of public finances in the euro area differs significantly across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">According to the IMF the debt-to-GDP ratio ranges from 6 percent in Estonia to 152 percent in Greece in 2011, while the aggregate debt-to-GDP ratio for the euro area stands at 87 percent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">But let me also emphasise that restoring sound public finances is not only a challenge for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As I mentioned before, government deficits and debt levels in many advanced economies outside the euro area have also risen to historically high levels, at least in a time of peace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For the largest industrialised countries such as the US, UK and Japan, according to the IMF the debt-to-GDP ratio in 2011 ranges from 83 percent in the UK, to 100 percent in the US and 229 percent in Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.79,0)">The state of public finances clearly matters for central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">At least from a theoretical point of view, one of the reasons is that monetary policy could in principle be used – or abused – to alleviate a government’s budgetary woes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The regime that has prevailed in advanced economies over the last three decades has been a regime of monetary dominance, under which central banks can pursue price stability-oriented policies without having to take into account the government’s budget constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Central banks have been given an explicit mandate to maintain price stability and have been protected by legal provisions guaranteeing their independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.03,0)">Credible, stability-oriented monetary policy frameworks are assets that have been difficult to acquire and must not be put at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">As I have pointed out, monetary policy thinking went through a remarkable evolutionary process during the last century which resulted in price stability for billions of people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.43,0)">As serious questions have arisen about the medium term sustainability of public finances in a significant number of industrialised countries, we cannot but conclude that the same evolutionary process did not happen to fiscal policy making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.19,0)">Fiscal policy making has not managed to converge to a framework with clear principles and medium term objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.98,0)">Growing doubts about governments’ ability to deliver sustainable public finances could at some point also cast doubt on the sustainability of the prevailing regime of monetary dominance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This would lead to an increase in inflation expectations or at least heightened uncertainty about the inflation outlook in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.41,0)">It is a fallacy to think that loose monetary policy can solve the large structural problems we are facing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.88,0)">Central banks must not become the victims of their own success and should not become overburdened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Historically, whenever policy makers tried to broaden the role of monetary policy beyond its original role as a guardian of the value of a currency, it had to compromise on its objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For monetary policy to remain effective, its responsibilities must remain within clear limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Instead, we need a growth model that is different from the one during the years before the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">We need economic growth that is based on a genuine increase in productivity, and not on low interest rates and the accumulation of debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.25,0)">The unlimited accumulation of private and public debt before the financial crisis has now become a burden on economic growth and should be reduced progressively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">To achieve this we need far-reaching structural reforms that increase competition in labour and goods markets, more financial supervision, and a stronger fiscal policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">We must reform financial supervision and strengthen economic governance so that economic policy becomes less pro-cyclical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Basel III is a very important step in the right direction, as it should provide for higher minimum capital requirements and better risk provisions by financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.32,0)">Still, regulation of the banking system and financial markets has not yet progressed sufficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Fiscal policy should be more grounded in a rules-based framework with clear medium term objectives, similar to monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The adoption of fiscal rules by some countries is clearly an improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In the euro area, a number of steps have been undertaken to strengthen economic governance so that concerns about competitiveness and fiscal policy can be addressed pre-emptively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But for the ECB these steps do not go far enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">For rules and sanctions to be fully credible they should be stricter and automatic - not subject to the political process - so that countries have the right incentives to address their problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">, “A Brief History of Central Banks,” Economic Commentary, Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.</span><span
