    <h2> Introductory statement delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Brussels, 29 November 1999 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)"> Hearing before the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs Introductory statement delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Brussels, 29 November 1999 With the transcript of the questions and answers It is my pleasure to meet you once again, in order to present the ECB's analysis of current economic and monetary developments and to inform you about recent monetary policy decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I should like to start my address by reviewing the main economic developments that contributed to the recent decision of the Governing Council of the ECB to adjust its monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In addition, I should like to give you an overview of some other issues which have been addressed by the ECB since our last meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Current economic developments and prospects As you will be aware, on 4 November 1999 the Governing Council of the ECB decided to raise the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem, which will continue to be conducted as fixed rate tenders, by 50 basis points to 3.0% with effect from the operation which was settled on 10 November 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The interest rate on the marginal lending facility was also raised by 50 basis points to 4.0% and that on the deposit facility to 2.0% from 1.5%, both with effect from 5 November 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The decision to increase interest rates was based on information related to both the first pillar of the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem, namely a prominent role for money, and the second pillar, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for future price developments and risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Starting with the analysis of monetary aggregates, monetary data up to September 1999 reinforced the view that M3 growth had been on a rising trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from July to September 1999, stood around 1½ percentage points above the reference value of 4½% set by the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The deviation from the reference value, which has to be monitored and interpreted with caution, has been growing steadily in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">The strong growth of the most liquid components of M3 is particularly noteworthy, and this seemed to be linked to the relatively low level of the opportunity costs of holding these assets which bear either no interest or only a low rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">However, over recent months in particular, the upturn in economic activity probably also contributed to the acceleration of M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Credit to the private sector also continued to expand rapidly during September 1999, at a rate in excess of 10%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The demand for loans remained very strong throughout the first three quarters of 1999, supported in particular by the low level of bank lending rates and the ongoing economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Overall, these monetary developments implied the existence of a generous liquidity situation in the euro area which could generate upward risks for price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">At the same time, the prospects for economic growth in the euro area improved significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">This is confirmed by the latest data from Eurostat on real GDP growth over the first half of 1999 as well as by data on industrial production, which indicated that the recovery in economic activity progressed in the third quarter of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Various surveys available indicated that a further strengthening of economic activity could be expected in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The external environment supports the positive outlook for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The most recent economic figures for the United States continued to point to robust output growth while the prospects for output growth in the United Kingdom also improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The countries which were most affected by the financial crisis in Asia showed stronger signs of recovery, while in Latin America the consequences of the Brazilian exchange rate crisis were contained, although some risks still remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">HICP increases were slightly over 1% at the time of the decision to raise interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">However, I should like to stress that the decision of the Governing Council was taken in a forward-looking manner, taking account of the prospects for inflation over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In this respect, the upward trend evidenced by monetary growth and the outlook for the development of economic activity provided clear indications of upward risks to price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.14,0)">Finally, we had to take into account the fact that the downside risks to price stability which motivated the cut in ECB interest rates in April 1999 were no longer apparent at the time of the meeting of the Governing Council on 4 November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">To summarise, the rising trend in M3 growth in excess of the reference value in conjunction with the strong growth of credit indicated that the liquidity situation in the euro area had been generous thus far in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Together with the broad assessment of the prospects for economic developments in the euro area, this reinforced the view that the balance of risks to future price stability had gradually been moving towards the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Therefore, there was a need to adjust the stance of monetary policy with a view to maintaining price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.77,0)">This decision should not be seen as endangering economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">On the contrary, by aiming to nip inflation risks in the bud, it will contribute to a long-lasting phase of sustained economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Indeed, the financial markets have received our decision favourably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The analysis of several indicators from the money, bond and stock markets on the days around the decision suggests that financial markets delivered a positive assessment of the appropriateness and timeliness of the interest rate decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.99,0)">The increase in short-term interest rates was accompanied by a decline in euro area bond yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This suggests that the move contributed to containing long-term inflation expectations and to the reduction in risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.9,0)">As a matter of fact, the expected volatility of bond yields in the euro area declined considerably from around 4 November, which can be seen as further confirmation that the move was perceived as reducing the uncertainty regarding the course of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">While an increase in ECB interest rates was to a large extent anticipated at the time of the decision, the announcement and the explanation of the decision were associated with a sharp reduction in the expected volatility in short-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Overall, our assessment of the move and its implications is positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We regard the change as an early move which was necessary in order to fulfil our primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Furthermore, a timely rise in interest rates will prevent the need for larger increases in interest rates at a later date and, hence, will contribute to stronger growth over an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.96,0)">Finally, let me mention the monetary data for October 1999 which were released this morning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The three-month average of the annual growth rates of M3, covering the period from August to October 1999, stood at 6.0% and thus remained 1½ percentage points above the reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In addition, the annual growth rate of credit to the private sector continued to exceed 10% in October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">This data does not yet alter the picture of a generous liquidity situation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The EU accession process and the Helsinki seminar I should now like to turn to several other issues that may be of interest to you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The Governing Council held a preliminary discussion on EU accession countries and the accession process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Indeed, the accession of new members to the European Union is an area of development in which the Eurosystem will be increasingly involved within its fields of competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">During its first year of existence, the ECB already had a certain amount of bilateral contact with central banks of accession countries, including official visits to some of them and receiving a large number of delegations at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Drawing on these experiences, the ECB organised, in co-operation with the Bank of Finland, a high-level seminar gathering together the Eurosystem and the central banks of the 12 accession countries, which was held on 10-12 November in Helsinki.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The seminar was, with only one exception, attended by all governors of the central banks of the candidate countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The principal purpose of the seminar was to review the central banking issues involved - both in the pre-accession process and, later, during EU membership - in the different steps which will ultimately lead to the adoption of the euro, in order to identify the main problem areas and to enhance co-operation between the Eurosystem and central banks of candidate countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I should like to give you a brief overview of some of the conclusions that emerged from the discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">First, there was a clear understanding that the timely adoption and implementation of the Community "acquis" is essential, in particular in the area of central bank independence and other legislation related to the monetary field and to banking and financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Second, as regards the convergence process, the seminar concluded that accession countries should pursue both "real" and "nominal" convergence in parallel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">"Real" convergence means the process through which the living standards of accession countries will be "catching up", progressively evolving towards levels closer to those of the current EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">It implies the adaptation of economic structures in line with those prevailing within the EU and the implementation of appropriate structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This process should be accompanied by nominal convergence, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">price stability and sound public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Progress towards nominal convergence should indeed go hand in hand with structural reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Accession countries need to continue to implement monetary policies geared to achieving and maintaining price stability, and to support this process with prudent fiscal policies and adequate structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Third, given the different starting points for the economic reform process and the difficulties involved in ascertaining, at this stage, the lead time for further progress towards nominal and real convergence, no common path should be prescribed for all 12 accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">It seems that a plurality of approaches with regard to the orientation of their exchange rate policies prior to accession, the inclusion of their currencies in ERM II or the later adoption of the euro would be more appropriate and would be feasible without compromising the principle of equal treatment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Fourth, and lastly, the smooth functioning of banking and financial markets is of the utmost importance for the successful integration of the applicant countries into the Single Market and, at a later stage, into the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The financial sector in the accession countries has been characterised in recent years by intense restructuring in the form of mergers, acquisitions and privatisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Central banks will contribute to ensuring that such developments occur within a general framework of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Finally, I should like to mention that in Helsinki the Eurosystem confirmed its readiness to provide technical assistance to the central banks of the accession countries in its fields of competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The working relationships between the Eurosystem and the central banks of the accession countries will be further developed in order to prepare successfully the steps which will have to be taken, in the Eurosystem's areas of competence, in view of EU accession and, at a later stage, the adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Euro banknotes and coins To conclude, I should now like to turn to another important issue, namely the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins on 1 January 2002, which will constitute the final milestone on the path to the completion of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Indeed, the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins will imply a major change in the everyday life of 300 million European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">It is therefore crucial to gradually prepare the general public in euro area countries for this event, in order to ensure that the new banknotes and coins will be favourably received.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">To this end, the ECB is preparing, in close co-operation with the European Commission and the euro area Member States, an information campaign - called the "EURO 2002 campaign" - which aims at making the public familiar with the design and security features of the new euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Particular emphasis will be put on the anti-counterfeiting features of the banknotes, which will reflect the state of the art.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Since public confidence in the new banknotes will essentially depend on the public's perception of the banknotes as a secure means of payment, the EURO 2002 campaign will explain to the general public and, more specifically, to cashiers in shops and banks how to examine the new banknotes in a quick and efficient way so as to detect possible counterfeits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Particular attention will also be given to the vulnerable groups in our society, such as the blind and partially sighted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">You may recall that in February the ECB published a tender notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities regarding a contract to prepare and implement the EURO 2002 campaign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">On the basis of the resulting applications, the Governing Council of the ECB took a final decision, selecting the company which is now assisting the ECB with the information campaign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The ECB looks forward to continuing its co-operation with the Community institutions and the Member States on our common efforts to ensure broad and comprehensive information for European citizens on the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.18,0)">Let me also briefly mention that the ECB recently published a report on the legal protection of banknotes in the EU Member States, which covers various aspects, such as the legal protection of euro banknotes against counterfeiting, copyright protection of euro banknotes, anti-banknote copying devices for reproduction equipment, the adoption and publication of euro banknote designs, the exchange of damaged or worn euro banknotes, the withdrawal of euro banknotes, the legal regime applicable to banknotes issued by entities other than the ECB and the national central banks, and the issuance of non-legal tender tokens and banknotes denominated in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The report presents the views of the ECB on the ways and means of ensuring the legal protection of euro banknotes and is thus part of our efforts to ensure a smooth introduction and widespread acceptance of the euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Chairman: I would like to thank you particularly for informing us about the monetary problems associated with the enlargement process, and you have also told us about the concerns of the public who must be informed about the introduction of notes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I would like to ask, in connection with the information campaign 2002, that not only the ECB and the EC and the governments of Member States should be involved but also the members of this European Parliament who are being asked about this in practice all the time in their constituencies, about the practicalities of the introduction of the euro, which is why I think we should also be taking the initiative in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.32,0)">Now there is a whole series of questions President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">First of all we could perhaps concentrate on the monetary goals and strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">First of all for 27 minutes we have the EPP and I give the floor to Mrs Thyssen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Mrs Thyssen: Thank you Madam Chairman.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">I would like to thank the President of the ECB for coming here and for his introduction and I'd just like to pick up on what he said on the introduction of coins and notes in the year 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Since the last time that we met you here and were able to have a discussion with you, there was an ECOFIN meeting on the 3 rd of November at which the ministers of finance adopted a common statement on the introduction of notes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">In the statement they recognise the need for frontloading to ensure that there will be sufficient volume of notes and coins in circulation right from the first days in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">I think that frontloading would also be very useful for another problem you mentioned: security, and the need for citizens to get used to the coins and notes, this would also be very useful certainly in terms of volume.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Now, this common statement adopted by the ECOFIN Council, is that in line with the ECB's stance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.82,0)">I wonder if this has been discussed in the ECB because if I remember correctly your position in the past which you've set out to us is that the ECB is against frontloading because it is impossible from a legal point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Now the ministers are saying that it should be done and they have undertaken to have this done for the sake of small businesses and banks and also for the citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.1,0)">There they not just talking about notes but also about coins and I'd like to know if you have changed your position and what is the stance of the ECB?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.82,0)">What is your position on that distinction which is being made between notes and coins?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.23,0)">Unless there was a distinction being made here between who can produce the notes and who can produce the coins.</span>
