    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)"> Building the bridge to a stable European economy Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,at the annual event “Day of the German Industries” organised by the Federation of German Industries,Berlin, 25 September 2012 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a privilege to be invited to address the Bundesverband der Deutschen Industrie this afternoon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The BDI in many ways mirrors the strengths of the German economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It simultaneously represents global multinationals and family-owned small businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">It is this combination of small, medium and large firms that gives German industry its uniqueness and resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">And this has been rewarded in recent years through strong growth and high employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.55,0)">The euro area as a whole has been facing challenging times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.68,0)">Financial markets are fragmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.19,0)">Economic growth has been broadly flat for the first half of 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.63,0)">Growth also remains highly uneven, with some parts of the euro area economy expanding at a solid pace, while others are still in a phase of adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">But my central message to you today is that, provided that all policy-makers persevere with the necessary reforms, we have a number of reasons to be positive about where the euro area is heading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">We are seeing signs of improved sentiment in financial markets and we expect the economy to return to growth next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">At the same time, considerable progress is being made on all fronts to strengthen the foundations of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Above all, the Member States of the euro area are undertaking determined measures to address the root causes of our current challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Individually, governments are implementing the fiscal and structural reforms essential for growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Collectively, they are reforming the governance of the euro area so as to guarantee sound policies for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">We at the European Central Bank   are continuing to maintain price stability, which is the foundation of growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">We have introduced new measures to ensure price stability by removing unfounded fears about the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">These measures are supporting financial market sentiment while deeper reforms are implemented across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">However, our measures can only build a bridge towards a more stable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">It must be completed with decisive measures by governments to address fundamental challenges and complete the euro area’s institutional architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">They are currently making progress in this direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The key challenge going forward is to ensure that the immediate upturn strengthens rather than weakens this commitment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Actions by the Member States to strengthen the euro area’s foundations Let me begin with the actions being taken by the Member States to strengthen the euro area’s foundations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Across the euro area, strong budgetary consolidation is taking place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The International Monetary Fund   forecasts that the euro area’s primary budgetary position will be almost in balance this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This means that, apart from debt service, all other expenditures are covered by current revenues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">This is quite an achievement in an international context: Japan, for example, will have a 9% of GDP primary deficit this year, the U.S. 6% and U.K. more than 5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And the euro area is not only performing well on average: each individual country will have a primary budget deficit lower than these three countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It is those countries most in need that are making the largest adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Important improvements are also taking place in competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">For example, the countries under full EU-IMF programmes have seen unit labour costs improve by around 10% since 2008, relative to the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.71,0)">This has translated into current account deficits that are on average more than five percentage points of GDP lower than they were then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">And this is not only due to lower imports, but also rising exports induced by higher competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">At the same time, the Member States are taking significant steps to improve euro area governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Governance of fiscal policies has been decisively strengthened with the fiscal compact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This agreement is a powerful tool for keeping fiscal policies in balance and reducing debt to sustainable levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Governance of financial policies is also now being given proper attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The European Commission has recently proposed a single supervisor for euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.4,0)">Single supervision is particularly important in a single currency area where countries are more immediately affected by instability originating from other member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Such single supervision should ultimately lead to a more stable financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Taken together, these actions show that clear progress is being made towards addressing the fundamental causes of our current challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Deficits are being reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Rebalancing is happening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And governance is being reformed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Actions by the ECB to ensure price stability Let me turn to the ECB’s recent actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">We have played a role in improving overall confidence by removing unfounded fears about the euro area that were affecting our ability to ensure price stability – notably through our recent announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions, or OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me briefly explain the rationale for this decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.93,0)">The euro area has experienced a very severe fragmentation in its financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.34,0)">In recent months, we have seen highly divergent borrowing costs for the real economy in different parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.71,0)">In our analysis, these differences were larger than justified by individual credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.24,0)">They reflected, to a considerable extent, unfounded fears about the future of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.35,0)">For example, a loan to a family in Germany for a house purchase with a five- to-ten-year maturity had an interest rate of 3%; the rate for a comparable borrower in Spain was 7.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At the same time, the average firm in Germany paid around 3% for a new loan over five years, while the average firm in Italy paid above 5.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.96,0)">In these circumstances, monetary policy cannot work properly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is because a key channel through which the ECB ensures price stability is through the cost of credit, in particular bank credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Bank credit accounts for about 70% of external financing of euro area firms, and that ratio is even higher for smaller enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.49,0)">But if we are unable to influence borrowing costs in some parts of the euro area, this channel is disrupted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.12,0)">Firms and households have less access to financing, economic growth stalls and these regions are faced with a risk of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.24,0)">In other words, our ability to ensure price stability for the whole euro area is compromised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.33,0)">The ECB’s Governing Council therefore faced a choice: to accept this situation and allow the singleness of its monetary policy to be undermined; or to take actions within its mandate to restore the normal transmission of monetary policy across all parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">We decided in favour of the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Our actions aim to repair monetary policy transmission through providing a credible backstop in government bond markets that removes unfounded fears and tail risks from the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Insofar as this supports investor confidence, it will help stabilise conditions in other markets, such as those for corporate and bank bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.49,0)">This ultimately feeds into more even borrowing costs for the real economy across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Early signs suggest a positive effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Since the beginning of this month, euro area banks issued about 27 billion euros of new debt – the most since March of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.56,0)">Some of these banks had not been able to access the market for almost six months previously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Non-financial corporations have also issued around 43 billion euros of new bonds, the highest figure for five of the last six months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.43,0)">It is too early to tell the full impact of our measures on borrowing conditions for firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It will take time for the effects of our actions to feed through systematically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">But the fact that we have seen positive signs so quickly is revealing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">It shows that investors are fundamentally confident in the overall trajectory of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">They are ready to re-invest at the first signs of stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This underscores my central message today: the euro area is making progress – and investors are recognising that progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The benefits of stability for the euro area as a whole I have described how the measures taken by both the Member States and the ECB are beginning to improve confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This will ultimately lead to greater overall stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The benefits of this do not accrue only to countries in difficulty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">They accrue to the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This is particularly true for an open and outward-looking country like Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">German industry is a sector deeply embedded in the wider European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The stability of the euro area is key to its sustained prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For this reason, ECB actions to maintain price stability for the whole euro area are directly in its interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">As has long been recognised in this country, low inflation and stable exchange rates ensure a level playing field on which German firms can prosper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">They can compete based on their sophistication and innovativeness, without unfair distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">At the same time, being part of a large and stable currency area provides a buffer against external shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">This will only become more essential in an ever globalising world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">These factors have led to real economic benefits for Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Its intra-euro area trade increased from around 25% of GDP in 1999 to almost 40% of GDP in 2010, while its extra-euro area trade increase by more than 20 percentage points in the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.9,0)">Almost 65% of foreign direct investment in Germany now comes from the euro area – and more than one and a half million jobs depend on that investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In other words, a stable euro area supports a strong German economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">And a stable euro area is the objective of the all the measures that I have just described.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Moreover, measures that support investor confidence also support the proper functioning of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.78,0)">For instance, TARGET2 data suggests that balances have now fallen slightly from their peak in August.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This highlights the fact that if investors are confident that adverse scenarios will not materialise, they will be more prepared to make cross-border loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This supports demand across the euro area and the smooth functioning of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.46,0)">I understand that some observers in this country have concerns about the medium-term implications of this policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">So let me be clear: we always have a medium-term orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">We are steadfastly committed to our mandate to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">And the measures we have announced fully support this commitment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">First of all, our actions are for the sole purpose of ensuring the proper transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.09,0)">They do not aim to finance governments, and nor would they if they were activated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Our operations would only take place in the secondary market, which ensures that money would pass to investors holding sovereign bonds, not to governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Moreover, we have been explicit that our measures can be only successful if they are accompanied by reforms from governments that address deep-rooted issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The Governing Council has made a strong commitment to such reforms a pre-requisite to be considered for our operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">This ensures that governments will continue to take essential measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Euro area citizens can be certain that we remain alert to any risk to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.79,0)">We have always delivered price stability in the past – indeed, the average rate of inflation in Germany since the launch of the euro has been the lowest since the 1950s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">And we will continue to deliver price stability in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The credibility of our commitment is clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Indicators of inflation expectations show that citizens and financial markets expect inflation to remain low in line with our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">We take very seriously the trust that citizens put in us to meet their expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We will not let them down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Building a bridge to the long term I have discussed the actions that the ECB has taken to ensure price stability and the positive early impact they are having.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Of course the current improvement in sentiment does not mean that everything is solved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The ECB’s actions can only build a bridge to the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The project must be completed through decisive actions by governments – both individually and collectively – to address the underlying causes of our current challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This requires further efforts by governments to restore fiscal sustainability across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">It requires deep structural reforms to achieve long-term competitiveness and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Governments must remain firmly committed to their current reform efforts, and not seek to relax them as economic conditions start to improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">To secure long-term stability also requires a second level of actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">For citizens and investors to fully regain confidence in the euro area, they need to be convinced that its design flaws have been permanently fixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">A concerted effort from governments to complete our economic and monetary union is therefore essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This does not require a choice between extreme options.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Some observers have argued that long-term stability requires a return to the original Maastricht framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Others have suggested that we need a full federation, a United States of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In my view, neither approach is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">We can ensure future stability by elevating to the European level only those policies that are essential for our union to function effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">I have been asked to work on identifying these policies under the lead of the President of the European Council and together with the Presidents of the Commission and the Eurogroup.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">In our view, a stable and prosperous union must be built on four pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">The first pillar is a financial union that can maintain a stable and integrated financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This implies a single supervisor to control risk-taking by banks and reduce regulatory capture – and a single resolution system to ensure that banks can fail without dragging down their sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">As regards the Commission proposal for a single supervisor that I mentioned earlier, I am confident that governments will find agreement on the appropriate perimeter of supervisory responsibilities, as well as issues related to democratic accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">For our part, we will guarantee the firm separation of monetary policy from supervisory tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">We will also ensure close cooperation with national supervisors who have the competence and resources to implement supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The second pillar is a fiscal union that can effectively prevent and correct unsustainable budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.86,0)">The consequences of misguided fiscal policies in a monetary union are too severe to remain self-policed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">So a stable EMU would ultimately require the establishment of true budgetary oversight at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The third pillar is an economic union that can guarantee the highest standards for competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Countries must be able to generate growth and high employment without excessive imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This implies that there must be minimum standards for key economic policies and incentives for continued structural reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The fourth pillar is a political union that can engage euro area citizens more deeply and make the other pillars legitimate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">This is essential to ensure that where sovereignty in selected policy fields is pooled, democratic participation is deepened in parallel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">A firm commitment from governments to complete economic and monetary union is the best complement to the ECB’s actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">It ensures that, by supporting immediate confidence, we will build the bridge to a more stable and prosperous euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">And it sends a clear signal to investors that the euro area has a vision for a sustainable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Conclusion Let me draw to a close.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In exceptional times, regaining stability sometimes requires exceptional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.42,0)">We cannot always look to the past for answers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">We may need to take new steps to achieve longstanding goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.41,0)">That is the situation we have been facing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">For the Member States, new steps have been needed to restore competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">A sustained commitment to reform efforts is required and a rethinking of the institutional architecture of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">For the ECB, new steps have been needed to maintain price stability in the face of fragmented financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.71,0)">These new steps are not a departure from our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Indeed, they are the only way to ensure that we continue to fulfil our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">All the measures I have described today are fundamentally about ensuring stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.71,0)">In the current circumstances, the greatest risk to stability is not action, but inaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.02,0)">This is why the ECB has acted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The euro supports the strong industrial sector on which Germany depends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It supports openness, growth and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">And ultimately, it supports peace and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.17,0)">This is why the euro is irreversible.</span>
