    <span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)"> Closing remarks at the ECB Workshop “What effects is EMU having on the euro area and its member countries” Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB17 June 2005 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to make the closing remarks at the end of this very stimulating conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Let me first thank the organisers of the conference for their excellent handling of a workshop which has been extraordinary successful in giving a lot of food for thought for all of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Today and yesterday you have debated very intensively the economic effects of creating a single currency – the euro – for an increasingly integrated European single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">I have no doubt you all agree with me that the achievements in terms of integration and convergence have been very impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The introduction of the euro has not only helped consolidating the tremendous gains that have been made in the process of European economic integration since the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community   in 1951.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">These gains have been both deep   and wide  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">I also strongly believe the euro is and will continue to be a key catalyst for further integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">One prominent example is the effect the introduction of the euro has had on accelerating financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Notably, the elimination of exchange rate risk among euro area countries has fostered very significantly the depth and breadth of financial markets and boosted financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">There is also evidence on much closer integration of stock markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Another important example is its effect on trade integration: evidence suggests that the euro has stimulated trade not only across the euro area, but also with the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The export share with countries outside the euro area rose to almost 20% of GDP in 2003 from around 17% in 1997  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">It is also remarkable that, possibly as a consequence of trade and financial integration, as well as the increasing degree of convergence of macroeconomic policies, dispersion of real GDP growth rates in the euro area has remained very close to its historical average and no signs of increased divergence in growth rates have emerged so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Today, I will not try to comprehensively review each and every of these important achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">I would rather like to highlight one of them: the truly impressive process of inflation convergence in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In this context, I shall address the issue of inflation differentials within the area, in particular their size and recent evolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I shall then focus on two particular issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">First, it has been argued that monetary union may contribute to a larger specialisation in production in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In this case, the need for relative price adjustments and inflation differentials to deal with sectoral developments may increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I will briefly discuss the current evidence on sectoral specialisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Second, I will elaborate on the function of the inflation differentials and emphasize the importance of monitoring relative unit labour cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Inflation convergence in the euro area Let me remind you that in the run-up to the formation of EMU, the dispersion of national inflation rates has been lastingly reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.57,0)">In 1992 the difference between the highest and lowest inflation rate in terms of HIPC across the euro area countries was 13.5 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.17,0)">The dispersion steadily declined throughout the 90s, triggered by the preparations for EMU, and broadly stabilised at the beginning of Stage Three of EMU at around 3.3 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Since then, with the exception of a modest increase over the period 2000-02, the level of inflation dispersion across the euro area has changed very little, with the average standard deviation of inflation differentials being around Current inflation differentials within the euro area are not unusually large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Rather, their magnitude is similar to those differentials seen in the United States among the 14 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas, namely 3.2 percentage points, with an average standard deviation of about 0.9.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It should be emphasised that in a monetary union inflation differentials across regions or countries are the natural way of adjusting relative prices in the face of asymmetric demand or supply developments I would like to make 4 remarks in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">First, changes in relative prices within the single currency area have been larger and more frequent than anticipated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.07,0)">The idea that the euro area is an area where the single currency prevents adjustment of relative prices is clearly refuted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">For instance, the capacity of the German economy to catch up rapidly with the average of the euro area in terms of cost competitiveness after the loss of competitiveness associated with German reunification is very impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">From that viewpoint the euro area is more flexible and adaptable than had been anticipated by many observers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.86,0)">Second, the previous process is symmetric.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.41,0)">In some cases the existence of inflation differentials is the natural consequence for an economy that has been outperforming the average in terms of cost competitiveness in order to progressively adjust towards a more normal level in line with the average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This problem had been observed, for instance, in the case of the Netherlands and is possibly still relevant for Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Third, inflation differentials are not only the necessary means of achieving relative price adjustments within the euro area, like in the case of Germany, but they are also a natural feature of the euro area in view of the gradual convergence or catching-up process regarding GDP per-capita.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.06,0)">Fourth, there is one case where persistent inflation differentials are not advisable in terms of national economic policies: this is when an economy having an already relatively low level of cost competitiveness continues to face further deterioration due to higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">In that case additional attention must be given to increasing the flexibility and adaptability of both institutions and market structures in the national economy concerned in order for the appropriate adjustment mechanism to function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Sectoral specialisation in the euro area An interesting issue that has been touched upon in the last two days is whether the European integration process will result in higher sectoral specialisation across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">As mentioned above, this is potentially important because a higher degree of specialisation might imply a greater vulnerability to asymmetric shocks and a greater need for relative price adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As to the relevance of this argument, there are two lines of reasoning in the economic literature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The first, supported by Krugman   and the new economic geography models, suggests that, as trade barriers are reduced, inter-industry trade increases and opportunities for exploiting economies of scale and specialisation in production should arise whenever countries have a comparative advantage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.05,0)">Consequently, countries’ production structures would become less diversified and thus increasingly vulnerable to asymmetric shocks while business cycles would become less synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The second, and opposite, line of reasoning, developed by Frankel and Rose  , suggests that European integration would instead lead to greater intra-industry trade integration and more similar economic structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In this case, business cycles would become more strongly synchronised through the convergence of factor endowments and technology, as well as reduced exchange rate variability, which otherwise would tend to weaken intra-industry trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The evidence on whether EMU has favoured or prevented specialisation in the euro area is not clear yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">According to an overview published by the European Commission, there have so far only been modest changes in the pattern of industrial concentration and geographical specialisation within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">While production specialisation has gradually increased since the 1970s, export specialisation appears to have decreased, which could be partly explained by the increased importance of intra-industry trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Similarly, a study of sectoral specialisation carried out by the European System of Central Banks in 2004 found the production structure of euro area countries to be relatively similar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Indeed, it appears more homogeneous than in the United States and relatively stable over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In contrast, a host of studies have highlighted agglomeration or clustering effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">They suggest that the agglomeration of production factors   is increasingly important and could indeed increase specialisation and reduce cross-border trade within industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">At the same time, some recent research   documents that risk sharing tends to increase in a currency union, bolstering the case for higher specialisation in production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.97,0)">The peculiarity of this channel is that any resulting asymmetries in GDP fluctuations would not translate in income volatility because ownership is diversified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">This essentially will help to smooth consumption across countries and, therefore, limit the welfare cost of GDP fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.83,0)">Overall, the time span since the start of the EMU is too short for strong empirical conclusions and a view of the effects of EMU on specialisation is consequently still difficult to obtain Determinants of inflation differentials Let me turn now to the determinants of inflation dispersion in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">A first insight into the possible causes of inflation differentials in the euro area can be gained by performing an inflation accounting exercise, which breaks down the euro area inflation differentials, measured in terms of the GDP deflator, into their underlying determinants, namely internal factors – such as unit labour costs, profit margins and net indirect taxes – and external factors – such as import prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This kind of analysis suggests that during the period 1999-2003 internal factors were the most important contributors to inflation differentials relative to the euro area average in the case of 9 member countries, while import costs played a major role in the case of only 3 countries: Belgium, France and Luxembourg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.86,0)">As regards the internal sources of inflation differentials, the most important component explaining the dynamics of GDP inflation has been the dispersion in unit labour costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.72,0)">Looking at the unit labour cost developments in more detail, the compensation-per-employee component was generally the most important in explaining inflation differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.7,0)">At the same time, productivity growth showed a relatively low level of dispersion across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.55,0)">This points to relatively significant differences across countries in those components of labour compensation that do not reflect productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.95,0)">In this regard, part of the differences in price developments may stem then from differences in wage developments, including inertial components of wage-setting rules, such as those caused by automatic indexation clauses of wages to prices, which exist in some euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">To the extent that historical inflation differentials within the euro area seem to largely reflect differences in cost developments across euro area countries, I would like to stress here that the relative evolution of cost competitiveness, as measured for instance by unit labour cost, is a key equilibrating mechanism in the single currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.29,0)">Concluding remarks Ladies and gentlemen, let me make three remarks in conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">First, there is no doubt in my mind that the full benefits of the European common market could not be realised without the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I propose to you the simple thought experiment: What would be, today, the US market if we would have had different currencies in California and Texas, Massachusetts and Wyoming?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Would we call it an “achieved single market”?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">In that perspective, the single currency offers us all the economic benefits associated with an “achieved single market”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.29,0)">In this respect, as regards interest rates and exchange -rate risk for each particular economy, there are no “winners” and “losers”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">It is a “win-win” game ….</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">All economies, without exception, are benefiting from the very low market interest rates that reflect the credibility of the currency: it is true that this is a considerable additional advantage given to those countries that had previously very high interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">At the same time, all economies, without exception, are benefiting from the elimination of exchange risk within the single currency area, which is a considerable improvement, including for those economies that had already very low interest rates, so that not only each economy is benefiting from a much better functioning of the single market itself, but also from a significant improvement of its own monetary situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It is equally true for Germany, for Spain, for Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is true for the 12 countries forming the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The single currency area is, in my view, a solid and coherent economy with all partners having strong advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Second, I have associated myself with the strategic concept of “competitive disinflation” during all the period during which a previously high inflation economy, namely the French economy, was looking for being more effective in reinforcing its competitiveness through lower production cost and lower inflation rather than through monetary devaluation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Now we are in an area where monetary stability is fully ensured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This does not mean that our preoccupation with competitiveness should disappear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">In this new environment of “competitive stability” the careful examination of national competitiveness indicators, like the relative evolution of unit labour costs, reemains important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The ECB has set up a benchmark of price stability in a medium and long term perspective - according to its definition - but a large part of economic policy remains national.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In this respect I said, before the setting up of the single currency, that in the new monetary regime economic policy makers would substitute competitiveness indicators to previous indicators like exchange rates and market interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Third, let me say to which extent we rely on research to analyse the structural transformation ongoing in the single currency area by the virtue of a fully achieved single market with a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.4,0)">My intuition is that this phenomenon is extremely complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.13,0)">That explains why trends are so difficult to substantiate, and conjectures not easily proved or rejected: the two effects underlined by Krugman on the one hand and by Frankel and Rose on the other hand, are probably operating simultaneously in the euro area, together with the universal phenomenon of agglomeration or clusterisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">All my experience tells me that in such a rapidly changing world, where the progress of sciences and technology, the globalisation process and the very profound structural changes in Europe are simultaneous, we have to be humble in front of facts and figures and be ready to take on board, as soon as it is produced, the good research you are delivering I thank you for your attention</span>
