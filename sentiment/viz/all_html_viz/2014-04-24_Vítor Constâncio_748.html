    <span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)"> Banking Union: meaning and implications for the future of banking Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at Banking Union Conference organised by the Master in Banking and Financial Regulation, Navarra University,Madrid 24 April 2014 Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you for inviting me to speak here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I was asked to share with you my views on the latest developments regarding the European Banking Union – in particular, what the meaning is of the achievements so far and what the implications are for the future of banking and the financial system in the Eurozone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But let me start briefly by looking back at the rationale for Banking Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.93,0)">I have addressed this in several recent speeches,   and in short, my view is that keeping supervision at the national level in both creditor and debtor countries contributed to the large imbalances that built up before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Contrary to the “it was mostly fiscal” view of the crisis, private financial sector developments, intermediated by banks, were at the heart of developments in peripheral countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This is why Banking Union is the necessary institutional response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.23,0)">Indeed, the current account deficits in most peripheral countries were in fact led by very large capital inflows coming from core countries with capital account surpluses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The exposures of banks from core to peripheral countries more than quintupled between 1999 and 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.5,0)">Competitiveness losses in the periphery were simply the mechanism that connected the capital account surplus and the current account deficit – that is, an appreciation of the real exchange rate caused by economic over-heating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As John Williamson explained long ago, it is impossible to have “an immaculate transfer” from capital inflows to current account deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.11,0)">Without unified supervision, national supervisors found it impossible to contain these developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.98,0)">They had to respect the single market rules and lacked the macro-prudential tools to offset the effects of large capital inflows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">But by introducing supervision at the European level, the Banking Union offers a possibility to better pre-empt such developments in the future – and therefore to better protect the real economy and financial stability in the whole area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">For the rest of my remarks, I will concentrate on two more practical and immediate goals of the Banking Union:   to eliminate the bank-sovereign loop and thereby reduce financial fragmentation;   to repair banks’ balance sheets, unclog the impaired credit channel and consolidate the on-going mild economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Finally, I will also reflect on some implications of the Banking Union for the future of the financial system and for the role of macro-prudential policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">The bank-sovereign feedback loop What makes the link between sovereigns and banks important is the fact that, during the crisis, weak banks weakened the sovereign and vice versa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.47,0)">Some governments had to support their national banks with negative consequences for their own debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.81,0)">In other cases, it was the weakness of the sovereigns, which had low ratings and difficulty in accessing the financial markets, that enfeebled domestic banks who saw their ratings tumble and their funding become more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">At the same time, as the sovereign debt crisis in 2010 deepened and triggered contagion effects across countries, banks’ holdings of domestic government debt rose, thereby increasing their dependence of the sovereign’s fortunes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.84,0)">These different forms of dependence created a negative feed-back loop that induced financial fragmentation among members of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.86,0)">It contributed to impairing the credit channel and the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.24,0)">Monetary policy interest rates were not properly transmitted and deposit and credit rates became too divergent among countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.05,0)">It was as though interest rates were not related to the same currency and that banks were not operating in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The ECB did its utmost to repair the transmission of monetary policy and restore the credit channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The OMT initiative proved effective reducing fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">More recently, world market developments, combined with the perception that the tail risk of euro redenomination has been overcome, have contributed to an inflow of capital into European periphery assets, further mitigating fragmentation of financial markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Severing this bank-sovereign nexus and reducing fragmentation was also the initial trigger for establishing the Banking Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">As you may remember, the idea of launching the Single Supervisory Mechanism   was born during the June 2012 European Council meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">It was a consequence of the decision that the ESM could directly recapitalise weak banks, thus taking some fiscal pressure off sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.06,0)">But if the European level were to assume liability for European banks, it also logically had to assume control: hence the need for a European supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It was only later, through the Van Rompuy Report, that the concept of a fully-fledged Banking Union appeared, which would contain a Single Resolution Mechanism   and a future possible Deposit Guarantee Scheme as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Thus, out of a desire to sever the bank-sovereign nexus, we achieved what can be seen as the biggest institutional reform since the inception of the euro, with implications that go well beyond the problem of the bank-sovereign loop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.66,0)">Somewhat ironically, however, this widening of the focus caused the initial objective to become obscured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.0,0)">The question of European direct recapitalisation – for which a framework has still not yet been decided – ceased to be the main focus of attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In the view of many commentators, the SRM became the expected instrument to achieve the separation between banks and sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.96,0)">But I see this is a somewhat misleading view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.19,0)">I will return to this later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Both components of the Banking Union, the SSM and the SRM, contribute to reducing the negative feed-back loop between banks and sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me start with the first building block, the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">One important objective of the SSM Regulation is to improve the quality of supervision and to ensure homogenous supervisory standards across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The SSM, from its operational start in November, will base its supervisory work on the best supervisory practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The general principles, processes, and methodology for supervision will be described in the SSM Supervisory Manual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">A comprehensive public version is being prepared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">The SSM will lead to a convergence of rules and standards and a harmonised supervisory culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">For example, by imposing common principles about methods and parameters that improve the reliability of banks’ internal models, it will address the problems created by differences in the way that banks calculate risk-weighted assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Importantly, the SSM will ensure that the same risks are given similar weights – recognising of course that the same types of risk can have different manifestations in different markets, reflecting the local economic situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There will also be a harmonised treatment of non-performing exposures and provisioning rules, which at present varies between jurisdictions and are not directly comparable for investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">More generally, the substantial compliance costs, from having to observe different sets of rules and different sets of reporting requirements, as well as having to interact with several different authorities, will be reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Under the SSM direct supervision of significant banking groups will be undertaken by joint supervisory teams will comprise supervisors from both the ECB/SSM and National Competent Authorities, thus enabling a fully integrated approach to the supervision of cross-border banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Compared with supervision at national level, this integrated approach will enable the SSM to detect excessive risk-taking and the cross-border externalities associated with it, and therefore to be proactive if local financial developments develop into threats to broader financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">I expect all these changes in the supervisory framework to contribute to reducing fragmentation by creating a level playing field for financial institutions and spreading best practices across borders, thus removing the barriers that existed in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">An important consequence of those changes which is essential for de-linking banks from sovereigns is the trust that, for both banks directly and indirectly supervised by the SSM, we are developing a genuinely European financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">This can help normalise interbank markets and overcome financial fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">That said, high standard banking supervision does not focus on preventing bank failures at any cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.34,0)">In fact, to effectively perform its tasks, a supervisor must also be able to let failing banks exit the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This is the reason why the SSM has also been given the competence to withdraw from credit institutions their authorisation to operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">However, given the role of banks in the financial system and in order to safeguard financial stability, the supervisor has to feel confident that the resolution of banks can be conducted in an orderly fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This brings me to the second pillar of the Banking Union, the SRM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">The establishment of the SRM is the second crucial step towards addressing financial fragmentation and breaking the bank-sovereign nexus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This is because the orderly resolution of banks, even large ones, helps avoid costly rescues by sovereigns that may endanger their own finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The SRM creates a single authority responsible for the resolution of banks in the euro area and participating Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">This will enable swift and unbiased resolution decisions, which will address notably cross-border resolution cases in an effective manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In this respect, the SRM should be viewed as a necessary – and logical – complement to the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It would indeed be ill-advised to elevate the responsibility for supervision to the European level, while keeping resolution at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.78,0)">This would create a mismatch of responsibilities, undermine the credibility of the SSM as supervisor, and delay the resolution of banks – a task that has to be done swiftly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">An important element of the SRM is the Single Resolution Fund, which will be financed via levies on the banking sector and gradually mutualised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Starting with national compartments, it will become a truly single European Fund in the course of eight years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">By mutualising the cost of bank resolution, this approach will loosen the link between domestic banks and their sovereigns and further level the playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.26,0)">A shortcoming of the SRM, however, is the absence of a clear common financing arrangement that would provide additional temporary resources when needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In practice, however, the SSM and SRM may not be sufficient to completely sever the ties between sovereigns and their domestic banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.14,0)">The effect of SSM and harmonised supervision on trust among banks may be more limited than expected, while, more importantly, the SRM may face legal limitations to autonomously managing the orderly resolutions of significant banks using its own funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.42,0)">These limitations come from the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive  , which is applicable to all 28 EU member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The BRRD is in my view one of the most crucial regulatory change in Europe of late.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">It represents a true paradigm change, ending the culture of bail-out and ushering in a culture of bail-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As of 2016, in all resolution cases, the BRRD will require a bail-in of shareholders and creditors equal to at least 8% of total liabilities of a given bank, including own funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Only after the 8% threshold can money from the resolution fund be used and for a maximum amount of 5% of total liabilities   of the bank under resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.65,0)">Public money, either from national governments or from direct European recapitalisation of banks, can only be used at the very end of the process which, in practice, should happen exceedingly rarely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Bail-in of shareholders and creditors plus the use of the Resolution Fund should in most conceivable cases, be enough to ultimately cover for the losses incurred by the bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">The “Government financial stabilisation tools" that the Directive introduces open the possibility of broader public interventions in the case of serious systemic risk situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It remains however, an instrument of last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">We are still far from the initial plan of direct European recapitalisations regarding this important question but the goal of avoiding to overburden the sovereign with banks’ rescues has in practice been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The amount of 8% is very substantial compared to the losses banks faced in the recent crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.0,0)">To give an idea, between 2008 and 2010 only one bank had losses exceeding the 8% threshold, and the average for all other banks was slightly less than 3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.4,0)">If we look further back at the Nordic financial crisis in the 1990s, none of the banks affected by that crisis faced losses of more than 8% of total liabilities including own funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.94,0)">Thus, under the BRRD, the injection of public money into banks, either from national governments or from direct European recapitalisation, should happen exceedingly rarely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Bail-in of shareholders and creditors plus the use of the Resolution Fund should in most conceivable cases be enough to cover the losses incurred by a failing bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me first briefly describe what happens once a bank enters into resolution and how the so-called “bail-in tool” works under the new framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The bail-in tool follows a sequential approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.11,0)">Before any resolution fund can be tapped, shareholders and creditors have to first absorb losses amounting to at least 8% of total liabilities including own funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Although uninsured deposits from individuals and small firms come last among liabilities possibly subject to bail-in, they would be included if needed to attain the 8% total.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">According to the new rules, only insured deposits are totally excluded from the bail-in tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Only after the 8% amount is bailed-in from shareholders and creditors, can money from the resolution fund be used and for a maximum amount of 5% of total liabilities   of the bank under resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Public resources can then be used only in case those two measures would not be not enough  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">While we all agree with the objective of protecting taxpayers’ money, it is important to examine what are the implications of the new rules for the banking market and for the sovereignty of member states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">As a natural result of the backlash against banks in our democratic polities following the huge crisis rooted in the financial system, the new framework imposes that banks’ bailout with public money is the ultimate resource after extensive bail-in tools have been activated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.06,0)">I agree that bailouts, especially when shareholders and bank management are not penalised, create moral hazard that may feed subsequent reckless management behaviour down the road.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.49,0)">The difficult judgment is of course to navigate in a general financial crisis between the Scylla of moral hazard and the Charybdis of financial collapse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The second aspect I wish to highlight is that by avoiding the commitment of public money and protecting tax payers as much as possible – a goal widely shared –participant countries in the Banking Union must shed considerable sovereign power, showing a remarkable willingness to continue to deepen European integration, thus reinforcing monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In fact, large countries with strong public finances must renounce to provide domestic banks with the implicit subsidy of public support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.73,0)">This will reduce their strength in competing in the European space with an advantage and will be progressively reflected in banks’ ratings and funding costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.59,0)">On the other hand, countries with vulnerable public finances and smaller banks will no longer be able to support, and possibly keep, their national champions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Finally, in both cases, governments accept the transfer of supervision and resolution of banks to the European level in what has to be considered a remarkable sharing of sovereignty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.86,0)">Another aspect of the BRRD reflecting the reluctance in the use of public money is the disposition that foresees that a criterion to put a bank formally into resolution is that it “requires extraordinary public support”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This disposition will apply as of January next year and will very likely be in force when the corrective supervisory action stemming from the SSM Comprehensive Assessment will be in course of implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I rush to indicate that there is a possible exemption to this rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.43,0)">But according to certain interpretations, the rule is applicable, for instance, to a listed bank that fails the baseline scenario of a stress test, cannot raise private capital and has to request public assistance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.29,0)">Very likely, if such bank is formally put into resolution it may suffer irreparable damage in the market place, further complicating its situation and generating spillover effects on other banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.48,0)">This could mean, according to those interpretations, that under the BRRD, a bank may be put into resolution before actually attaining the point of non-viability if it just fails a baseline scenario of a stress test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.7,0)">We should be mindful that resolution does not lead to resurrection of the institution and, as seen by the market, normally implies deep restructuring, downsizing or even its winding down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.05,0)">The interpretations already mentioned would also imply that the public backstops for the purposes of the SSM Comprehensive Assessment announced last November, if used, would trigger putting the bank into formal resolution if the exemption I mentioned before would not apply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.88,0)">The terms of the exemption, surrounded by several conditions, are basically dependent on the need to avoid a serious disturbance in the economy of a Member State and preserve financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">We certainly hope that in the context of such a wide-ranging undertaking to assess the robustness and resilience of European banks, there will be reasonable financial stability aspects to justify them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Also, in 2015 such an exemption should have no operational implication for the bail-in rules of the Directive as, contrary to the rest of the BRRD articles, its bail-in rules will be applicable only after January 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Also, the granting of such an exemption would not preclude the application of the only bail-in rule in place in 2015 which exists in the context of State Aid principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The bail-in rules now in place stem from the European Commission’s communication of July 2013 on “State Aid rules to support measures in favour of banks in the context of the financial crisis”  , which establishes that any public support to banks considered as State Aid should be preceded by bail-in of bank shares, contingent capital hybrids and subordinated debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.91,0)">Again, in this case, the text contemplates that exceptions “can be made where implementing such measures would endanger financial stability or lead to disproportionate results”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">For concrete cases, at the end of the SSM Comprehensive Assessment, it may be adequate to invoke such principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.64,0)">In 2015, another potential complication may come from problems of a legal nature that can create difficulties to the maintenance of a level playing field in the context of our exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.17,0)">Some countries may have no national law or legal ability to implement burden sharing rules ahead of the entry into force of the BRRD bail-in rules in 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Amid these concerns, it is hoped that all the relevant legislation and related exemptions are applied in the wake of our Comprehensive Assessment with the adequate balance between the different values of avoiding moral hazard, assuring market discipline and level playing field, and safeguarding financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The present situation of apparent easy access to capital markets driven by investors’ appetite to invest in banks provides hope that the whole question of public backstops can move to the background.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">If this situation remains unchanged until November banks that need to reinforce their capital buffers should be able to raise money in the private market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Nevertheless, I advise all banks, besides raising adequate levels of capital, to carefully study the new legislation on resolution and bail-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.11,0)">The bank market and even competition for controlling capital stakes will be significantly affected as the legislation enters into force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">At the same time, investors should learn and internalise the new bail-in rules that will dominate the market for bank securities from now on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.79,0)">Clearly, to avoid moral hazard, any public interventions should penalise shareholders and managers appropriately, as was done in the exemplary case of the Nordic banking crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Here financial and economic collapse was avoided with, in the end, virtually no costs for taxpayers when the restored banks were sold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Thus, after the misbehaviour of several institutions that triggered the recent crisis – which by the way is still being uncovered – I fully support the change of culture from easy public bailouts to a new culture of private bailing-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The burden of proof should be put on those who want to invoke exemptions to the new approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.21,0)">Yet, we need to bear in mind that it is not only direct public support for banks that has a cost for taxpayers, but also financial instability – indeed, the costs of the latter may be higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Compare the worldwide costs for taxpayers stemming from the absence of public intervention to rescue Lehman Brothers, with the zero cost for taxpayers following the USD 700 billion injection into US banks in 2008  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.11,0)">In other words, financial instability can have a meaningful cost to taxpayers even if it is not visible in the very short term – a notion that all policy makers should keep in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For this reason, in my view we should not take away from public institutions that understand the externalities of financial crises the capacity to make balanced and complex judgements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">The new European legislation does allow, as a last resort, for interventions that can safeguard financial stability in a Member State or in the area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">I trust that this legislation will be applied by the competent authorities with rigour, wisdom and a sense of proportion in the aftermath of our Comprehensive Assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Banks’ balance-sheet repair and the economic recovery Let me now turn to the implications of Banking Union for the economy more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.92,0)">Some economists are of the view that negative developments in bank credit in the euro area are predominantly due to credit supply restrictions – namely, insufficient capital to absorb supposedly still unrecognised losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.25,0)">This view is not entirely correct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We have observed a marked increase in banks’ capital ratios since the beginning of 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Since the onset of the global financial crisis, the top 20 European banks have increased capital in dollar amounts, net of share buy-backs, by much higher numbers than the corresponding top 20 American banks: USD 289 billion by EU banks against USD 179 billion by US banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">And according to the FDIC, the leverage ratios of the biggest European banks, calculated according to the same accounting standards, are very close to their American peers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Since the middle of last year in particular, European banks have implemented write-offs and increased provisions and capital, partly anticipating the Comprehensive Assessment that the ECB is conducting this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">As a result, confidence in the euro area banking sector is now starting to rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">This development has been recognised by the stock market where banks’ share prices increased by 41% in 2013, above market average growth of 20%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Nevertheless, the task of bringing back confidence in the EU banking sector still needs to be completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This is why the Banking Union, and in particular the Comprehensive Assessment of banks’ balance-sheets, is so important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It will trigger corrective supervisory action where it is needed and dispel any remaining doubts about asset valuations and the corresponding level of provisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">This in turn will help bring the deleveraging process in the banking sector to a swifter conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.29,0)">In the short-term, this may have a pro-cyclical effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">However, a fast and targeted rebooting of the banking system could have two positive effects going forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.65,0)">The first effect is cyclical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">A well-functioning banking sector will support the transmission of our monetary policy in all parts of the euro area, thus helping observed growth to rise towards potential growth and the output gap to close.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This is because, on the asset side, banks that are restructured and recapitalised will no longer have incentives to ration lending towards smaller firms with higher capital charges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">And on the liability side, as they gradually reach their target loan-to-deposit ratios through raising deposits, the funding costs between banks in the core and periphery of the euro area will further converge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.56,0)">The second effect is structural.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">To the extent that the Comprehensive Assessment helps fixing the bank lending channel and ends the so-called “ever-greening” of loans  , it will support an efficient credit allocation process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This could in turn support the overall process of reallocation within the euro area economy, thus boosting productivity and possibly reversing the slowdown in potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Nevertheless, a word of caution is warranted in the sense that a sudden jump start of credit growth may not immediately result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.28,0)">The recent behaviour of credit cannot be explained solely by credit supply restrictions, but is also largely linked to lack of demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Completing banks’ balance-sheet repair is thus a necessary but not sufficient condition to consolidate the on-going recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.33,0)">The weak domestic demand outlook prevailing in the euro area combined with underutilised industrial capacity is the most important explanation for the drop in private investment during the crisis, and the most important limiting factor for higher growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Other important effects of the Banking Union The on-going overhaul of bank supervision and resolution frameworks will also have implications that go well beyond the primary objectives of financial stability and completion of the Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me focus on three effects in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Further integration of the European banking market The first effect is the likely consolidation of the European banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Restructuring in the euro area banking sector has already been on-going since 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.97,0)">For example, in net terms the number of credit institutions has fallen by 9% since 2008, or around 600 institutions, while total assets of the euro area banking sector have declined by almost 12%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.81,0)">However, this consolidation was more due to retrenchment than to active M&A deals in the industry, which have instead been rather weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.27,0)">From 2008 to 2012, the overall value of deals decreased fourfold to just EUR10 billion, with cross-border deals being the most affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.8,0)">Yet, the Herfindahl-Hirschman concentration indicator for the euro area banks remains, at the 690 level, well below the 1600 level above which concentration becomes detrimental, which means that there is margin for further efficiency-driven consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.42,0)">The weak profitability and excess capacity of the European banking sector also suggests that efficiency gains could be reaped from more consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">This, together with the on-going repair of bank balance-sheets, should set the stage some time down the road for a new phase of M&A geared towards improving efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It also seems likely that the Banking Union will create the conditions for further integration of the European banking market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Unified supervision should create greater trust among banks and cross-border banking groups will be able to optimise their internal management of capital and liquidity and reduce compliance costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">We expect hidden barriers to disappear and liquidity and capital management to take place at the SSM level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Thus, the movement towards subsidiarisation that we observe in other parts of the world has no justification inside the SSM perimeter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">This should also reinforce the consolidation dynamics I just mentioned: it is natural for the establishment of the SSM and the Comprehensive Assessment of banks’ balance-sheets to a period of general, market-driven restructuring in the European banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Enhancement of the role of capital markets The second effect is enhancing the role of capital markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In the euro area, banks have historically played an important role in financing the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Bank loans account for most of household borrowing and around 50% of non-financial firms’ external financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This is very different from the US where around 75% of firms’ financing comes from capital markets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">However, recent evidence suggests that corporate bond financing was an important alternative to bank financing in the euro area during the financial crisis, when banks were unwilling or unable to lend, mostly reflecting pressures to de-lever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Although these pressures have eased and the economic recovery is beginning in Europe, I expect the shift towards more capital market-based intermediation to persist going forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">One reason is that the new regulatory environment gives banks incentives to hold marketable, liquid securities, such as corporate bonds or asset-backed securities, as opposed to corporate loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">This will, in my view, increase the complementarities between marketable assets and corporate loans within banks’ balance sheets, where in the past they were considered as substitutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">What I am suggesting is not that Europe will – or should – abandon its intermediated model of financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Rather, it will complement it, more than in the past, with alternative sources of finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This change, combined with the structural deleveraging of the banking system and the new regulatory regime, should enable the financial sector to keep providing adequate levels of credit to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The diversification of the financing mix will have obvious advantages for euro area firms, as it will allow them to access a larger pool of non-bank investors and to better insulate themselves from shocks in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The role of macro-prudential policies The third effect linked to Banking Union is the emergence of new macro-prudential policy tools for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.73,0)">Before the crisis, banking supervision in most   countries was fundamentally “micro-based”, focusing on the safety of individual institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.74,0)">But the crisis has shown that the stability of individual financial institutions alone is not enough to ensure the stability of the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">This is the reason why the SSM will have not only micro-prudential powers but also new macro-prudential instruments to counter financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">And it will be able to apply prudential measures in both borrowing and lending countries, which was not possible before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">At the current juncture, macro-prudential policies can address at least two related issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">First, by strengthening banks they can contribute to increasing credit flows to the real economy, thus mitigating the likelihood of a so-called credit-less recovery – a type of recovery that is generally quite mild.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">At the same time, as macro-prudential policies can be targeted at specific sectors or regional developments, they can help attenuate the credit cycle heterogeneity that characterises the euro area and support a more balanced recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.48,0)">Second, one cannot exclude that present accommodative monetary policy generates pockets of instability in some specific market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Macro-prudential tools can in principle allow the ECB/SSM to address such financial imbalances in a granular way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">For example, instruments like the counter-cyclical capital buffer can be applied at the national level to curb domestic credit booms, allowing monetary policy to remain focused on euro area aggregates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Going forward, by dealing with imbalances specific to a group of countries or to a given sector of the euro area economy, macro-prudential policies should effectively take into account heterogeneities among Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">They should thus contribute to reducing dispersion, which in turn enhances the uniform transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Banking Union is an essential complement to Monetary Union and a project with vast consequences for European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.74,0)">It is not, however, the end of the journey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Banking Union must provide a stable and efficient framework for the major endeavour, which is completing the economic and monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The dynamics of Jean Monnet’s functional method of integration are still fully operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">With each institutional innovation, others become necessary and more pressing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">For instance, to fully reap the benefits of Banking Union, we need legislative changes that complete the programme of financial services integration, particularly in relation to the capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">That would include changes to company law, bankruptcy rules and procedures, and higher harmonisation in the taxation of financial products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">I would like to see the Commission promote these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Other necessary institutional developments have also been well identified in the President Van Rompuy’s Report “Towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">First, a more complete Fiscal Union along the lines described in that Report seems necessary for the euro area, which goes beyond mere disciplinary rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Specifically, it calls for “….the establishment of a fiscal capacity to facilitate adjustment to economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">This could take the form of an insurance-type mechanism between euro area countries to buffer large country-specific economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Such a function would ensure a form of fiscal solidarity exercised over economic cycles, improving the resilience of the euro area as a whole and reducing the financial and output costs associated with macroeconomic adjustments”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Second, under the umbrella of Economic Union, we need further progress towards the completion of the single market of services, and a more co-ordinated approach to macroeconomic policy at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Finally, the sovereignty-sharing that monetary union represents implies moving forward towards political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.26,0)">The euro area is, in the end, a political project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">We need now to complete the integration of European nations, while respecting the fact that this unique community is neither a nation nor a state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In my view, the question that should guide us is how to preserve and defend national identities and interests in a globalised and challenging world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Banking union and the future of banking, speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the IIEA Conference on “The Future of
