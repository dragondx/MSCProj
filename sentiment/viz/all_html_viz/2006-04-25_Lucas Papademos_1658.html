    <h3> Speaker: Lucas Papademos </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)"> Presentation of the ECB’s Annual Report 2005 to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Lucas Papademos,Vice-President of the ECBBrussels, 25 April 2006 Madam Chairwoman, members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, it is an honour for me to present to you the ECB’s Annual Report for 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The presentation of the Annual Report is a core element of the ECB’s accountability vis-à-vis the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">As we have always stressed, the ECB places the greatest value on the fulfilment of its accountability obligations, and I am looking forward to a fruitful dialogue with you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In my introductory statement, I will first briefly review economic and monetary developments in 2005 and in early 2006, focusing on the monetary policy decisions of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I will then address a number of the policy issues examined in detail in the Annual Report which I consider to be of particular relevance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Economic and monetary developments In 2005 real GDP in the euro area expanded by 1.4%, somewhat below the 1.8% growth recorded in 2004, but the pace of economic activity tended to strengthen during the second half of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Annual HICP inflation averaged 2.2% in 2005, marginally higher than the rate of 2.1% observed in each of the two preceding years, mainly as a result of substantial increases in energy and commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.42,0)">When reviewing economic and monetary developments and the ECB’s monetary policy decisions in 2005 and early 2006, it is useful to divide this time period into two parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.62,0)">In the first half of 2005, real GDP growth in the euro area remained moderate and there were heightened uncertainties with regard to the short-term evolution of domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Annual HICP inflation eased to 2.0% on average in the first half of 2005, mainly reflecting base effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.32,0)">Although higher oil prices exerted significant upward pressure on inflation, there was no evidence of underlying domestic inflationary pressures building up, as wage developments remained moderate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">At the same time, economic analysis identified a number of upside risks to price stability which were perceived to prevail over other, potentially dampening factors on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Moreover, monetary dynamics continued to strengthen in an environment of already ample liquidity, driven by the most liquid components of M3 and, on the counterparts side, by faster credit expansion to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">These developments reflected to a large extent the stimulative effect of the very low level of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.47,0)">Against the background of subdued domestic inflationary pressures, and with inflation expectations for the euro area as a whole solidly anchored at levels in line with price stability, the Governing Council concluded during the first half of 2005 that it remained appropriate to keep interest rates at their historically low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">At the same time, it emphasised that the cross-checking of the economic analysis with the monetary analysis supported the case for continued vigilance with regard to the materialisation of risks to price stability over the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In the second half of 2005, economic activity gradually strengthened and HICP inflation rates rose to levels significantly above 2%, peaking at 2.6% in September, mainly as a result of rising energy prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.09,0)">In addition, it became increasingly apparent that the upward shift in oil prices would be protracted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Accordingly, in the course of the second half of 2005, the likelihood that average annual HICP inflation would remain above 2% over the medium term increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.92,0)">Moreover, this scenario of elevated inflation rates remained subject to previously identified upside risks posed by possible further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of past oil price increases, additional rises in administered prices and indirect taxes, and potential second-round effects in wage and price-setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Furthermore, the monetary analysis continued to point towards increasing upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Monetary growth gained momentum in the third quarter of 2005 and credit expansion to the private sector remained very robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Consequently, in the second half of 2005 the Governing Council expressed increasing concern about upside risks to price stability and emphasised the need for strong vigilance with regard to these risks and developments in longer-term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Indeed, by December a first adjustment of the very accommodative stance of monetary policy was clearly warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">In view of the risks to price stability that had been identified in the economic analysis and confirmed by cross-checking with the monetary analysis, the Governing Council decided on 1 December to increase the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, after having kept them unchanged for two and a half years at the historically low level of 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Turning next to more recent developments and assessments, in early March 2006 the outlook for growth and inflation over the medium term that had emerged at the time of the December 2005 decision was confirmed by the incoming data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">HICP inflation rates were expected to remain above 2% over the horizon of the Eurosystem staff projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Upside risks to the inflation scenario prevailed, as implied by the economic analysis and confirmed by the strong monetary and credit growth in an environment of already ample liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The Governing Council thus decided on 2 March 2006 to increase the key ECB interest rates by a further 25 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The information which has become available since the Governing Council’s decision on 2 March 2006 confirms our assessment that a further adjustment of our accommodative monetary policy stance in March was warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">It is essential that inflation expectations continue to be solidly anchored at levels in line with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.81,0)">Interest rates across the whole maturity spectrum are still at very low levels in both nominal and real terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Monetary and credit growth remain strong and liquidity abundant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Our monetary policy thus remains accommodative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Both economic analysis and monetary analysis indicate that upside risks to price stability prevail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Accordingly, the Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all developments, so as to ensure that risks to price stability do not materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">By maintaining price stability over the medium term, we preserve the purchasing power of households, and by ensuring that inflation expectations are solidly anchored at levels in line with price stability, we help to maintain favourable financing conditions for investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">In this way, we make an ongoing important contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Fiscal policies and the revised Stability and Growth Pact The preservation of price stability and the attainment of higher sustainable growth require the support of sound fiscal policies and the implementation of appropriate structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I would now like to address a number of pertinent economic policy issues, starting with fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.0,0)">The spring fiscal notifications point to a euro area general government deficit of around 2.4% of GDP in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Thanks to comparatively strong revenue developments, this outcome is slightly better than the deficit of 2.5% expected a few months ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.45,0)">However, this improvement has generally not been translated into lower planned deficits: in 2006, according to the updated stability programmes, the euro area general government deficit is expected to decrease only marginally to around 2.3% of GDP, and the debt ratio is set to remain above 70% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.16,0)">These figures are still of a preliminary nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.74,0)">In some countries, deficit-debt adjustments   continue to be sizeable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.13,0)">This may be a cause for concern, considering that in some cases in the past such discrepancies were followed by significant upward revisions of the budget deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">With regard to the implementation of the revised Stability and Growth Pact, there is no uniform picture emerging across Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.74,0)">Overall, progress towards sound public finances remains slow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">In general, Member States have defined reasonable medium-term budgetary objectives, and the planned consolidation progress is in most cases in line with the revised framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.3,0)">However, in some cases the planned pace of consolidation is very slow indeed, and many countries do not have sufficiently concrete or credible plans to comprehensively address the fiscal imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The implementation of the excessive deficit procedure is broadly consistent with the revised Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.98,0)">At the same time, a number of countries continue to report severe imbalances, and some of them have presented plans that barely attain the minimum adjustment called for by the revised Pact, despite the improving growth outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.84,0)">The prospective budgetary costs of population ageing also cast a shadow over the long-term fiscal outlook for most euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">To adequately address the long-term fiscal challenges and support higher sustained economic growth, sound budgetary positions should be pursued in a more determined manner, avoiding reliance on one-off and temporary actions and employing effective policy measures, embedded in a comprehensive reform strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Such comprehensive and systematic consolidation and reform efforts will enhance the credibility of the revised Pact, help to establish confidence in a sound and growth-friendly fiscal environment and boost consumer confidence, thus fostering economic activity and employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The Lisbon strategy The recent call by the European Council to maintain the momentum of the relaunched Lisbon strategy for growth and employment is very important, and has been explicitly welcomed by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">It is vital for potential output growth and job creation that this initiative is successful and that European citizens can see that it delivers results and eventually increases their welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">There is a real danger that, with a further delay of reform delivery, Europe may not reap the expected benefits of reforms, including greater market flexibility and efficiency, higher productivity and potential growth, reduced unemployment and price pressures and increased resilience to economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">We clearly need more reform in almost all policy fields: more reforms of public expenditure as well as of tax and benefit systems, so as to enhance the quality and sustainability of public finances; more measures raising wage and price flexibility; more competition in goods and especially in services markets; more action to achieve a fully operational EU internal market; more steps towards an entrepreneur-friendly business environment; more research & development; more innovation; and better education, training and lifelong learning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">It is, therefore, crucial that, at a minimum, the measures announced in the national reform programmes are implemented in a timely and comprehensive manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">European Monetary Union may have increased the economic incentives for implementing such reforms as differences in cost and price levels between euro area countries have become more visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.76,0)">However, in recent years a gap has developed between the need for and the actual implementation of reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Reducing this gap now requires both a greater public understanding and acceptance of reforms as well as more effective peer support and pressure, through the benchmarking of progress, than is currently in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In this regard, we support the European Parliament’s call to promote best practice across countries by measures such as “an annual league table showing the best and worst performing countries”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">As emphasised by the European Council, the Lisbon strategy is on the right track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">There is a consensus on the objectives and agreement on the necessary institutional setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">What is now needed is a determined focus on the effective and comprehensive implementation of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Euro area enlargement Let me conclude with a few remarks on a very topical issue – the enlargement of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">As you are aware, both Slovenia and Lithuania have asked the European Commission and the ECB for an examination of whether they have achieved a high degree of sustainable convergence, in line with the Treaty requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">The ECB is currently in the process of preparing the respective Convergence Report, which will be published on 16 May.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.57,0)">I ask for your understanding that I cannot, of course, discuss today the substance of our assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">What I can confirm, however, is that the ECB will make use of the same framework of analysis employed in the past and that our assessment will build on the same definitions and principles as set out in previous Convergence Reports, so as to guarantee continuity and equal treatment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Our report will examine both countries’ preparedness to adopt the euro by assessing whether a high degree of economic convergence has been attained, and whether such convergence has been achieved in a sustainable manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The report will also ascertain whether the relevant national legislation is compatible with the Treaty and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">I am aware that the Commission will be available to explain its Convergence Report to the plenary session of the European Parliament; the ECB would certainly stand ready to do the same with its own report, should such a meeting be desired, and – in this way – to continue the constructive dialogue between our institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I am now at your disposal for questions.</span>
