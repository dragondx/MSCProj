    <h1> Laudatio for Hans Tietmeyer </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB Münster City Hall, Westphalia, 26 March 2010 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)"> Laudatio for Hans Tietmeyer Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBMünster City Hall, Westphalia, 26 March 2010 Lord Mayor, Mr Hillebrandt, Dear Hans, Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here giving this speech in honour of my dear friend Hans Tietmeyer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The Westfalen-Initiative has made an excellent decision in inducting Hans Tietmeyer and Freiherr vom Stein   into the Westfälische Ehrengalerie  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Induction into the Westfälische Ehrengalerie is a means of honouring prominent Westphalians for their services to the region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Of course, the achievements of Hans Tietmeyer, like those of Freiherr vom Stein, can be seen far beyond Westphalia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The historical significance of this city hall also extends way beyond Westphalia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">It has played host to pivotal events in the history of Europe, having witnessed the negotiation and conclusion of the Peace of Westphalia more than 360 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The Treaty of Münster and the Treaty of Osnabrück formed the basis for the establishment of peace in Europe following the Thirty Years War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Hans Tietmeyer has also participated in pivotal events in Europe’s history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Indeed, he played a decisive role in laying the legal foundations for Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The introduction of the single currency represents the greatest achievement to date in the history of European integration – a process which has ensured six decades of peace and prosperity in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Today, Europe faces further pivotal decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.55,0)">The global financial crisis has resulted in major challenges for Europe’s economic and fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I will talk more about these issues at the end of my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">I had the pleasure of spending many years working with Hans – particularly between 1987 and 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.92,0)">Initially, Hans was Secretary of State in the Ministry of Finance and I was Director of the Treasury.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.46,0)">Later, our periods as the governors of our respective central banks coincided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">When the ECB was established, we both became members of the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.88,0)">It was Hans who proposed not using members’ countries of origin to determine the seating plan for the Governing Council’s meetings and instead using alphabetical order to decide who sits next to whom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">After all, the members of the Governing Council are there to represent the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.12,0)">But maybe Hans just wanted to sit next to me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.45,0)">Because there is not much that fits between Tietmeyer and Trichet, also in the alphabet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">I always greatly appreciated working with him, and I learnt a lot from him about Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.7,0)">Hans Tietmeyer’s period as President of the Deutsche Bundesbank coincided with turbulence in the international financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.32,0)">By comparison with the recent global financial crisis, the Mexican crisis and the Asian crisis were less dramatic from a European perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Nevertheless, Hans Tietmeyer recognised at an early stage the threat that unstable financial markets could pose to a globalised world economy, and it was on his initiative that the Financial Stability Forum was established in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Ten years later, one of the responses to the global financial crisis was the enhancement of the Financial Stability Forum, which became the Financial Stability Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The number of participants was increased and its remit was extended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The Financial Stability Board has thereby become a key institution in the reform of the international financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Above all, though, Hans Tietmeyer’s time at the Bundesbank was marked by preparations for Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">His tireless support for rules ensuring the stability of the single currency has proved to be entirely justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The euro area’s 330 million or so citizens are now benefiting from the fact that the currency in their wallets is as solid as the Deutsche Mark used to be  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The euro – a stable currency The euro is just as strong as the most stable of its predecessors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The ECB has ensured price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">At the end of this year, the average inflation rate since 1999 will, in all probability, be around 1.95% – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">just under 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Thus, the euro need not shy away from comparisons with the Deutsche Mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.88,0)">The average inflation rate in Germany in the 1990s prior to the introduction of the euro was 2.2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.05,0)">In the 1980s it was 2.9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.77,0)">Many people still don’t want to believe it, but the euro has not increased inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">However, price stability is by no means the only advantage that Germany enjoys as a result of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.69,0)">Without the euro, the financial crisis would certainly have triggered additional turbulence on the currency markets, also causing further damage to the German economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.94,0)">People like Hans and me who were directly involved in the EMS crisis know what they are talking about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">In his book “The euro challenge”, his memories of the events of 1992 and 1993 are headed – appropriately, I think – “monetary earthquake” and “strong aftershock”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">The successful resolution of that crisis is another one of Hans Tietmeyer’s lasting achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.49,0)">Europe’s monetary integration could have ended in failure as a result of that episode.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Price stability is, without a doubt, the best contribution that central banks can make to people’s well-being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.9,0)">Nevertheless, many people virtually don’t take much notice of their central banks’ operations in normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.66,0)">Furthermore, the mechanism for the transmission of monetary policy decisions is very complicated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">This makes it all the more important for people to be able to rely on the delivery of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the case of the ECB and the Eurosystem, they can rely on it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Price stability is our primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">The Governing Council has defined price stability as increases in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices for the euro area of below 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">The Governing Council has, in addition, specified that it strives for increases of “below, but close to, 2%”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">With the aid of this quantitative definition, we have succeeded in firmly anchoring inflation expectations at a low level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This has been of great assistance to us during periods of both increasing and decreasing inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The central banks have worked hard for those low inflation expectations, which have been achieved primarily as a result of decades of credibly following stability-oriented policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Those inflation expectations are of fundamental importance for the success of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.9,0)">It would therefore be a very serious mistake to aim for a higher level of inflation in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.93,0)">Consequently, as I have stressed on a number of occasions, I strongly oppose this idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.71,0)">Pandora’s box must remain shut.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The weakening of our price stability objective is out of the question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Price stability benefits us all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It safeguards purchasing power and the value of savings, and it prevents the arbitrary redistribution of wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Only in the presence of price stability does the price mechanism function in an efficient and transparent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It is the main instrument for the steering of our market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Independence guarantees a stability-oriented monetary policy An important requirement for the delivery of price stability is the independence of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.13,0)">We know this as a result of the painful learning processes that central banks have undergone in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Germany was one of the first countries to have an independent central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I myself was Governor of the Banque de France when it became fully independent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Central bank independence was “Europeanised” and became the model for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">On 1 January 1994, more than 16 years ago, I saw for myself the enormous difference that it makes to preside over a fully independent institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">It has now long been demonstrated – both theoretically and empirically – that central banks are better able to ensure low and stable levels of inflation when they are independent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Of course, independence does not mean arbitrariness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Instead, that independence is tied to a concrete objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And independence requires accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In the case of the ECB, its mandate specifies that the delivery of price stability is its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The quantitative definition of price stability does not just contribute to the anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">It also provides people with an objective yardstick with which to judge our work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The mandate and the independence of the Eurosystem are enshrined in Europe’s treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.75,0)">These are quasi-constitutional in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.18,0)">Monetary policy has been removed from the remit of national politics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.67,0)">At the same time, the ECB – like other central banks – cannot complain that it has lacked advice from politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This is something of a tradition when it comes to independent central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.56,0)">Don’t forget Adenauer’s famous “guillotine speech” in 1956.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.88,0)">Half a century later, Heads of State or Government attempted – again, unsuccessfully – to influence the monetary policy of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.73,0)">When growth weakened in 2003 and 2004 the then leaders of the three large euro area countries demanded an instant reduction in interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The Governing Council refused to reduce rates, and I was proud to refer to the Adenauer precedent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.92,0)">Later, at the end of 2005, many governments warned against increasing interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">We did indeed increase rates, the ECB stuck to its mandate, and today nobody disputes the fact that our decisions were correct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.02,0)">At the time, however, we were under considerable pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">We withstood that pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.81,0)">In most cases, criticism of independent central banks is sparked by restrictive decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.52,0)">Expansionary policies are rarely criticised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.79,0)">This shows that many pressure groups, as well as politicians, who often are under short-term pressure, don’t think in terms of the time horizons considered by central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.79,0)">The ECB is independent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.12,0)">It does not allow any government, institution or lobby to influence its monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The citizens of Germany and the rest of Europe can rely on us to continue to deliver price stability in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Our defence of our mandate will be just as resolute as it has been in the first 11 years of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.43,0)">A monetary policy that pursues short-term objectives is doomed to failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">However, this focus on the longer term means that those independent central banks also stand in contrast to the short-termism of the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.98,0)">The global financial crisis is also fundamentally a result of short-term thinking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Challenges arising from the financial crisis The handling of the financial crisis and its economic consequences has been a great challenge for us all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.99,0)">Governments and central banks have had to intervene on a massive scale in order to stabilise the financial system and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The monetary policy measures adopted by the Eurosystem have allowed inflation expectations to be kept stable even during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">From the very beginning, our interventions were designed in a way that allowed us to unwind them easily as soon as conditions improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">At no time did we lose sight of our price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Countries’ budget deficits have risen substantially on account of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.39,0)">Rising debt levels do not just bring with them the potential for greater conflict between fiscal and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.62,0)">Above all, they also place a burden on the sustainability of public finances in the countries in question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">It is therefore in the interests of each and every country to return to sound public finances as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In the current circumstances, where Europe faces pivotal decisions, it is more important than ever to recognise that a prosperous union requires determined action by all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The most important issue is that Europe’s policy-makers live up to their responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">As I mentioned yesterday, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank has always stressed the need to preserve and reinforce peer surveillance inside the euro area, to strictly apply the Treaty provisions and the Stability and Growth Pact, and to have the best functioning possible of the Commission and of the Eurogroup.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Particularly as regards the government members of the Eurogroup, the ECB’s Governing Council has always considered that it was important that they would, as a college, live up to their very important responsibilities as regards fiscal policies, the monitoring of relative competitiveness and structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">I am therefore pleased that the Heads of state and government of the euro area could work out a solution, implementing their earlier declaration to “take determined and coordinated action, if needed…”, which maintains the lead responsibility of European policy makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Monetary Union in Europe is far more than a monetary arrangement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As Hans Tietmeyer said many years ago, the Monetary Union is a community that shares a common destiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And we should not forget that we are also a community of values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Price stability is the best contribution that central banks can make to the stability of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Price stability is even a necessary condition for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.82,0)">However, price stability is not a sufficient condition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Many people share responsibility for financial stability, and all must live up to that responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.12,0)">The crisis has revealed weaknesses in the institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Thus far, it has not been sufficiently possible to encourage the Member States to implement policies that are in line with our benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Fiscal policies, wage policies and structural policies must conform to our stability target of inflation of just under 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">I am convinced that we will find ways of achieving this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.32,0)">Conclusion Before I finish, I should like to recount a short anecdote.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.33,0)">Once, while Raymond Barre was Prime Minister  , he asked me, given that I worked at the Treasury, whether I often travelled to Brussels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In that case, he said, I must meet Hans Tietmeyer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">He said: “He is very influential, and he is a tough negotiator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">If you have issues to discuss with him, good luck!” That was a considerable compliment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Germany and Europe have much to thank Hans Tietmeyer for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">He was resolute in ensuring that the euro would be a stable currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Today, after having had to cope with the worst financial crisis since World War II, we can say with confidence that the euro has been a stable currency since its inception and that the euro area is a stable community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As I said earlier, Hans Tietmeyer is the author of a book entitled “The euro challenge”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">I am certain that the euro will be equal to that challenge.</span>
