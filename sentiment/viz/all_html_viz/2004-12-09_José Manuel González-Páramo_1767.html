    <span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)"> The euro after six years: achievements and challenges ahead Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank,Universidad Complutense Madrid, 9 November 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, I should like to begin by saying what a great honour and pleasure it is for me to have been invited to speak again at the Universidad Complutense, which is somewhere I always feel at home because it has in fact been my home for more than 20 years now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Today, I plan to share with you some thoughts on European Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Almost six years after the launch of the euro, I believe it is time to draw up a list of the achievements made during this period and, of course, the new challenges that lie ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The process of monetary union started more than 10 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In 1989 the Delors Report laid out the blueprint for the foundation of a European Economic and Monetary Union, while three years later, in 1992, the legal framework was established with the signing of the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">In order to guarantee the success of the new currency the Treaty defined a clear institutional framework and obliged a certain nominal convergence among countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">On the one hand, it stipulated that there was to be a single currency and monetary policy geared towards the objective of price stability conducted by the Eurosystem, consisting of the European Central Bank and the national central banks of the euro area, which were to be independent from political interference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In addition, it contained a set of fiscal rules, subsequently developed in the Stability and Growth Pact, signed in 1997, to guarantee sound public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Under this framework, Member States were committed to avoid excessive deficits and to correct them promptly should they nonetheless occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">On the other hand, the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 specified a number of convergence criteria that Member States needed to meet before entering into monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">These criteria included convergence towards price stability, sound public finances, exchange rate stability and low and stable long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.61,0)">Initially, a great deal of scepticism towards the idea of a common and stable currency surfaced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.62,0)">At first, there was a general consensus among academics that Europe could not be considered ex ante an optimum currency area, while some criticised the fact that there were no mechanisms in place to deal with asymmetric shocks, given that monetary policy was defined only in terms of the whole area, national fiscal policies were constrained by the Stability and Growth Pact and the size of the EU budget was clearly insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.58,0)">Against this background, where do we stand today?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">What assessment can be made six years after the launch of the euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">To answer this question let me first concentrate on what I consider to be the achievements of this period, in order to later address the challenges for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The achievements Euro cash changeover My first remark has to be on the successful physical introduction of the new currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The fact that over 300 million citizens in Europe have been sharing the same tangible currency since January 2002 is the most visible expression of the process of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Furthermore, the fact that the introduction of the euro was extremely smooth and was free of any major problems can be regarded as the first remarkable success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.11,0)">Exchanging the legacy national banknotes and coins of the 12 countries of the euro area with the euro presented, in organisational, logistical and technical respects, a huge challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">In addition to producing more than 15 billion banknotes in 15 printing works across the euro area to the same high quality standards using raw materials from different suppliers, the logistics of the actual changeover process also represented an enormous undertaking requiring a huge amount of early preparation and intense discussions at several levels in order to ensure a smooth and successful transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This success can be attributed in no small part to the quality of the preparations made by all sectors involved and at all levels as well as to the enthusiastic reception given by the public in the euro area to their new banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Price stability As I have already mentioned, the Maastricht Treaty assigns to the Eurosystem responsibility for maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.19,0)">However, it does not give an indication on how price stability is to be interpreted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.41,0)">In this respect, in October 1998 the ECB defined price stability as an annual inflation rate for the euro area of below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.18,0)">In a clarification of the monetary policy strategy last year, the ECB announced that it would aim to maintain inflation rates below but close to 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This medium-term orientation is aimed at preserving monetary policy from “short-termism”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.11,0)">Without such an orientation, monetary policy runs the risk of slowly veering from its foremost role of providing a firm medium-term nominal anchor for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.37,0)">This medium-term perspective is also a recognition that monetary policy cannot control price developments in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Has the monetary policy that has been applied since the introduction of the euro proven to be a success in maintaining price stability as previously defined?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Looking back over this period, since the average inflation rate in the euro area has been exactly 2%, the answer to that question should definitively be yes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.74,0)">Occasionally, the inflation rate has moved above the 2% ceiling as a result of temporary shocks, for example the recent sharp rise in the price of oil products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">However, when such shocks occur, what is important is that price stability is maintained over the medium term, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">once the shock has abated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In this context, it is interesting to note that long-term inflation expectations   have never exceeded 2% since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This success should not be minimised given that the ECB started without a track record of its own in terms of credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Communication: transparency and accountability The Maastricht Treaty granted the ECB full political independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Given its mandate to maintain price stability in the Eurosystem and its independent status, the ECB is accountable to the European public and its elected representatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This requires it to be transparent in all areas that are relevant to the fulfilment of its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Transparency is also essential for the effectiveness and success of the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">It should help to understand how monetary policy reacts to data and indicators, contributing to the anchoring of inflation expectations and enhancing the credibility of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">The announcement of the monetary policy strategy in October 1998, before the introduction of the euro, was the first and more important step towards a high degree of transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Moreover, the Governing Council’s assessment of the economic situation and the risks to price stability are regularly published.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Monetary policy decisions are explained at the press conference which takes place immediately after the first Governing Council meeting of the month, and further details are presented in the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin, in the speeches given by members of the Governing Council and in the President’s testimonies before the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">With its monthly press conference, the ECB has set new standards of transparency and, in fact, other central banks are now moving in the same direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Integration of financial markets Both economic theory and empirical findings suggest that the integration and development of financial markets are likely to contribute to economic growth by removing frictions and barriers to exchange, by allocating capital more efficiently among investment opportunities and by creating more scope for risk sharing and risk diversification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Moreover, financial integration supports an efficient and homogenous implementation and transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">During the last decade there has been a continued process of integration in European financial markets, which has brought about a surge in cross-border trading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The establishment of Economic and Monetary Union has indeed accelerated this process, thus contributing to economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In particular, the depth and breadth of markets has increased, as the elimination of exchange rate risk and the removal of intra-area currency matching rules has allowed many more investors to access the various markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">In addition, intra-area exchange rate risk premia have disappeared, which, in combination with reduced premia linked to the increased emphasis on stability-oriented economic policies, has significantly reduced financing costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Another important development in euro area financial markets during the last six years has been the rapid growth of new market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The euro-denominated corporate bond market, for example, grew from less than EUR 400 billion of outstanding bonds in 1998 to well over EUR one trillion this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Moreover, completely new market segments saw the light of day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">In particular, the high-yield segment of the euro area corporate bond market grew from being virtually non-existent to a significant portion of the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">All in all, monetary union seems to have been highly beneficial for euro area financial markets, although improvements can still be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">If we take the deep, liquid and unified US financial markets as a benchmark, the euro area clearly still has some way to go, especially as regards the integration of equity markets, the establishment of common legal and regulatory frameworks, and the consolidation of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">International role of the euro The internationalisation of any currency is largely a market-driven process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.47,0)">Whether or not a currency is used outside the euro area by non-residents for financing, investment or invoicing purposes is a matter of economic agents’ preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">In this respect, stable and trusted currencies are more likely to gain a place in global markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Therefore, the fact that in six years the euro has become the second-most widely used currency in the world can be seen as an additional factor of the success of the process of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Part of this international role was inherited from the legacy currencies, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.71,0)">the 12 currencies that were replaced by the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">However, through the creation of a large single economic entity and the integration of national financial markets in the euro area, monetary union gave new impetus to the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Non-euro area residents use the euro for a whole range of reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For instance, a growing share of the euro area’s external trade is settled or invoiced in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Central banks outside the euro area have gradually increased the proportion of their euro reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.57,0)">In the western Balkans, households use euro banknotes for large-value retail payments and the bulk of their savings are in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Given that the introduction of the single currency was accompanied by further financial market integration within the euro area, it comes as no surprise that, also outside the euro area, non-residents are using the euro for financial purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">For instance, they are notable issuers of euro-denominated bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In 2003, for example, some 31% of all international bond issues were in euro, compared with 44% in US dollars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In around 50 countries and territories– mostly in central and eastern Europe, the Middle East, the Mediterranean and Africa – the euro plays a role as an anchor for exchange rate policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">The challenges ahead Structural reforms While the process of monetary integration has been successful in terms of guaranteeing price stability, stable prices can only be considered a necessary but not sufficient condition for sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The difficulties encountered by the euro area economy in terms of expanding activity in the last three years, despite favourable financial conditions, highlight the need to implement appropriate structural reforms to realise the advantages of a stable single currency and thus achieve sustainable, non-inflationary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">This fact has long been recognised by EU policy-makers, most notably by the European Council when it adopted the Lisbon Strategy four years ago to foster economic growth and drive job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">More recently, the report prepared by the High Level Group chaired by Wim Kok provided an assessment of the Lisbon Strategy and confirmed the need to implement reforms aimed at fostering potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">In fact the report expresses an urgent need for renewed impetus, proposes a stronger commitment of national governments and a sharpening of the Lisbon Strategy’s focus by placing particular emphasis on the acceleration of employment and productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Raising the euro area’s growth potential requires indeed an increase in both labour input and labour productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.62,0)">As far as the labour market is concerned, the total and female employment rates are a long way off the intermediate targets set in the Lisbon agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.59,0)">In this respect, it can be said that the labour markets remain beset by rigidities in terms of wage formation and employment adjustment that are eroding their efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Wage bargaining outcomes should allow for appropriate wage developments in the overall economy, as well as a sufficient degree of wage differentiation to reflect regional and sectoral productivity differences more strongly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">In addition, a wide range of policies should aim at increasing the efficiency of matching potential workers to job vacancies, namely, investment in education, training and life-long learning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The contribution of labour productivity to the expansion of euro area output growth has an even less impressive record in recent years, since its growth rate has tended to decelerate significantly since the beginning of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Fostering labour productivity growth requires measures to foster investment   and raise total factor productivity, the growth of which depends on a more efficient allocation of the available resources and on technological progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">The regulatory environment is also crucial for creating the most favourable conditions for economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In this respect, there are important productivity gains to be reaped in the euro area countries by removing the barriers to competition that still remain at national and EU levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.75,0)">Fiscal policy While a number of countries have managed to maintain sound budgetary positions over recent years, in a number of other countries fiscal positions have deteriorated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.99,0)">Excessive deficits have emerged, and the procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact aimed at preventing and correcting these have not always been properly complied with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.83,0)">This lack of compliance calls into question the effectiveness of the EMU’s fiscal rules and has led to an intense debate in academia, among the informed public and among policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In the view of the Governing Council of the ECB, however, the current rules, as included in the Maastricht Treaty and in the European secondary legislation, are appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">No changes to the present wording are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me elaborate on the arguments behind this position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Fiscal discipline, along with a monetary policy geared towards achieving appropriate inflation targets, are necessary requirements for obtaining macroeconomic stability and thus for establishing the conditions for sustainable economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In a monetary union, fiscal rules are essential not only to contain domestic deficit biases but also to protect against cross-country externalities and adverse incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Indeed, without such rules, the countries of the euro area would never have agreed to share a common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Our current rules are a sensible compromise: a reflection of the need to combine economic soundness with simplicity and transparency, to balance rules and discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.01,0)">This does not mean that alternative rules would not have been possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">But by and large the current rules are appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.05,0)">Nowhere has it been established that the existing rules are the source of current fiscal problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.33,0)">Rather, it is the lack of implementation of the rules that is the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is where we need to focus our attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Areas where improvements could be made include focusing more on debt and sustainability when scrutinising national budgets; adjusting the timetable for multilateral surveillance; a more timely use of the “early warning mechanism”, in particular in good times; and improving the information base for fiscal surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.02,0)">Moreover, an additional challenge for maintaining sound public finances will emerge from the effects of population ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Ageing-related government spending will increase substantially in the decades to come as a result of demographic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">To strengthen the sustainability of public finances will thus require reforms of pension and healthcare systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Historic EU enlargement The enlargement of the European Union by ten countries from central and eastern Europe and the Mediterranean on 1 May this year was an exceptional historical event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These countries together comprise a population of about one fifth of that in the enlarged EU, while their total GDP as a share of the existing members is about 5% of the former EU15.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.33,0)">What are the economic implications of EU enlargement for the European economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.59,0)">As the debate about these effects is often dominated by concerns, the benefits that enlargement brings are often neglected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">In my view, these benefits will largely exceed the costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In fact, the preparations for enlargement have already had a significant impact on the European economy, especially in terms of trade and financial integration between the new and existing EU members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Since 1995, the share of the current new Member States in the EU15’s exports to and imports from outside the EU has increased by 50% to more than 13% in the case of exports and almost 12% in the case of imports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Dramatic progress has also been made during the past decade in terms of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Inflows of foreign direct investment   have largely increased, being a key driver of productivity growth and export dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In particular, according to the most recent data, the share of the current new Member States in the EU15’s total extra FDI outflows amounts to more than 12%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Moreover, while important challenges still lie ahead, enlargement has already helped to foster macroeconomic stabilisation policies and structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The effects of enlargement will be extended to the whole European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In fact, it is already beginning to strengthen the degree of competition as the accession of the new Member States increases the number of suppliers within the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Furthermore, an enlarged Single Market is enhancing the scope for economies of scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">These effects should lower prices and increase productivity, thereby contributing to an increase in the potential growth rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">However, for these potential effects to materialize fully macroeconomic conditions should remain stable and the necessary structural reforms should be implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Concluding remarks Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">In my speech today I have emphasised the main achievements of introducing a new currency for 300 million citizens, the maintenance of price stability in the euro area, the promotion of further integration of financial markets and the euro’s gradually increasing international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In essence, we can say today that the euro has done its job in terms of fostering sustainable growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">However, in order to achieve this common objective in reality, appropriate structural reforms will need to be implemented and sound public finances maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Only by doing so we will be in a position to benefit from the formidable opportunity represented by EU enlargement.</span>
