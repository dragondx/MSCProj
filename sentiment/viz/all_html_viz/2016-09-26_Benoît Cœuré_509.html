    <h1> Having confidence in Europe </h1>
    <h2> Keynote speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a conference organised by the Istituto Affari Internazionali, Rome, 26 September 2016 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.35,0)"> Having confidence in Europe Keynote speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at a conference organised by the Istituto Affari Internazionali,Rome, 26 September 2016 The European Union is going through a difficult phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.51,0)">The economic crisis, the threat of terrorism and the arrival of an unprecedented number of migrants are posing challenges to Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The EU’s responses to these challenges have not removed doubts about its ability to act coherently and effectively when common solutions are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.04,0)">Following the UK’s referendum on EU membership, Europe has become embroiled in a wide-ranging discussion about its raison d’être.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This discussion will however not be successful if it is merely a diplomatic exercise: if Europe is about bringing Europeans closer together, it needs to relate to its citizens and listen to civil society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In other words, the res publica needs to be discussed in the various parts of the forum, not just the Curia, where senators met here in Rome, but also the Comitium, where citizens could openly debate the matters of the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">I am thus grateful for your invitation and the opportunity to speak here at the Istituto Affari Internazionali today and to engage in a discussion with you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">What I will present are observations and assessments from the perspective of a European central banker who can analyse and provide suggestions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But, as you will see, quite a number of the issues that I will discuss today lie outside the realm of central banking and can in fact only come about through political debate and ultimately political leadership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.59,0)">In my view, the European Union today lacks confidence in two important ways: First, there is a lack of confidence in Europe; that is, in the ability of European policies to address today’s challenges, reap the benefits of globalisation while controlling its costs, and increase Europe’s economic potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.76,0)">This lack of confidence is reflected in the low levels of public trust in EU institutions, in the rising support for Eurosceptic parties, and was evident in the outcome of the UK referendum in June this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.35,0)">Second, there is also a lack of confidence between Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.64,0)">This is compounded by a perceived lack of a strong unifying bond or joint identity as EU citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.82,0)">The divergence between national public discourses on economic governance has reached disturbingly high levels in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.31,0)">Sometimes, there is not even a common analysis on what has gone wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.21,0)">Policymakers are increasingly speaking about each other and not with each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Let’s therefore set aside the preconceptions and ask ourselves how we can restore confidence in Europe and between Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">First, I will argue, there is need for resolute actions at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Second, there is need to provide clarity and ensure consistency in European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">And, third, to overcome political fragmentation, there is need to reinforce common fora for debating the future of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">There are good reasons to have confidence in Europe First, I believe that there are in fact good reasons to have confidence in Europe and I want to mention some of them .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Alongside the United States and China, the European Union is currently one of the three biggest economic blocs in the world, each of roughly equal size in terms of purchasing power parity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Europe protects its citizens from external economic disruption and offers them a unique social model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">A social model that we can be proud of and that can inspire the world, provided we can make it sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Furthermore, we have managed to largely mitigate the recent financial and economic crisis, which for many countries in the EU was the most serious crisis since the Second World War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.38,0)">It was only four years ago that the euro area looked into the abyss.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">But today, we find ourselves in a significantly better environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.34,0)">In summer 2012, financial fragmentation was at its peak but has since then strongly receded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Five Member States were in economic adjustment programmes, four of them are now again standing on their own feet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.87,0)">Unemployment, although still unacceptably high in some countries, declined in 2016 for the third consecutive year, and employment growth in the euro area has beaten our expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The euro, despite the deficiencies in its architecture, has tangible benefits for the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">It is the second most important currency in the world, and it has delivered measurable economic benefits for Europeans since its introduction .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Investment and competition have likewise benefited from the reduction of currency risks and transaction costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The euro protected the Single Market by eliminating the possibility of competitive exchange rate devaluations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">And without the euro, it is unlikely that our small or medium-sized economies would have better weathered the global financial turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">During the crisis, the euro was arguably the greatest bond holding Europeans together: the commitment to protect the single currency and the integrity of the euro area determined key decisions taken by European institutions and Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Its force as a common bond is also reflected in public opinion: popular support for the euro has remained high throughout the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">In spring 2016, support for the single currency stood at 68% in the euro area  with a majority of citizens in favour of the euro in all euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The ECB as the institution tasked with safeguarding the price stability of the euro has proven that it is able to act decisively within its mandate, even in very difficult situations, and to adapt its policy tools to a changing economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">We estimate that all other things being equal the measures we have taken since 2014 will raise the inflation rate by more than half a percentage point, on average, in 2016 and 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">And they will help to increase real euro area GDP growth more than one and a half percentage points cumulated over 2015-2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Finally, the establishment of European banking supervision has brought some important improvements to the financial architecture of Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">For almost two years the ECB has now been supervising around 130 of the most significant banks of the euro area and indirectly supervising all other banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">And banks have substantially strengthened their capital positions in that time: since 2012, the CET1 ratio for significant banks, for instance, has moved up from 9% to more than 13% today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Moreover, ECB Banking Supervision is operating at arm’s length from banks and enforcing a level playing field in the euro area by harmonising supervisory practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">In summary, the EU’s economic potential, the euro as our single currency backed by a single, credible and effective institution and the establishment of the single supervisor are all very good reasons to have confidence in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Nevertheless, I won’t deny that we need to do much better in a number of areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">As mentioned previously, monetary policy has been very effective in supporting output and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">But as I have said elsewhere , our monetary policy measures were taken on the implicit assumption that they would be transient: on the one hand, because monetary stimulus would ultimately help counter the cyclical forces depressing the real equilibrium rate and on the other hand because other economic and fiscal policies would provide cyclical support and tackle the more structural drivers of low real rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.93,0)">But if fiscal and economic policies do not in fact play this role, we risk being trapped in a low growth, low interest rate equilibrium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.49,0)">Moving from interest rates being “low for long” to being “low forever” would severely limit the room for manoeuvre for conventional monetary policy tools, but even more worryingly, it would threaten the contract between generations as well as risk tearing up our social fabric.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Today, building confidence in Europe also means showing that together with national governments, it can steer us away from that outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">There are two ways in which we need to improve economic and fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">On the one hand national governments need to live up to their responsibilities for these policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">On the other hand, we need to strengthen economic and fiscal policy tools at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me explain this in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">National governments need to live up to their responsibilities The solution to this situation must start at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">One important cornerstone of the current set-up is the principle that responsibility for economic and fiscal policies lies largely with national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There are coordination tools at European level, but ultimately, decisions are made by the elected representatives at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Therefore, national governments need to live up to this responsibility: economic and fiscal policies need to be used more decisively so as to reduce structural unemployment and boost potential output growth in the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Italy has taken key steps in these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">A comprehensive reform of the labour market was carried out last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The new rules on open-ended contracts and the subsidy for new hires seem to be having an initial positive impact on the creation of permanent jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Important measures have also been taken to address the challenges of the banking sector and to reduce the administrative burden on firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">However, more structural reforms are necessary in Italy as in all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The focus should be on actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment, including the provision of adequate public infrastructure, all of which are vital in increasing investment and boosting job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery in a sustainable way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">There is room everywhere to focus public expenditure more on items which will raise productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Those countries that have fiscal room for manoeuvre should use it wisely; but others that don’t have such room should not bend the commonly agreed rules– that is in their own interest as well as in the interest of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Stretching rules to the point where they lose credibility will not pave the way for a stronger and safer Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Clarity and consistency in integration This leads me my second point: we need to strengthen economic and fiscal policy tools at European level by pursuing clarity and consistency in European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Clarity in integration is about making it easy to understand who is responsible for what.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In the current set-up, loose coordination of economic policies at European level and ad hoc intergovernmental arrangements may give the impression that a competence has been passed to the European level, when in fact it continues to be exercised largely by Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This opens the door to shifting the blame for unpopular measures to the EU when in fact it does not effectively have the power to adopt policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">In addition, a clearer demarcation of competences between the European and national levels would allow the EU to prove to national audiences that Europe is part of the solution and not part of the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Clarity is also about pointing out which institution takes which decisions at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is why I support the establishment of a euro area finance ministry, accountable to the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This body could be responsible for preventing economic and fiscal imbalances, managing crises in the euro area, as well as representing euro area governments in international economic and financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Consistency in integration means assigning the competences for strongly complementary policy areas to the same level of government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We cannot partially disempower national states without creating – at Union level – the capacity to provide at least as much security to citizens as before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me illustrate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The Single Market is a point in case: it requires not only the opening of borders but also joint rules to ensure financial stability and a level playing field with fair competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And joint rule-setting requires enforcement and judicial review, that is, supranational sovereignty sharing and political procedures that lead to common decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">And there are some good recent examples where the EU has exercised its power in this area for the benefit of European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Take the recent state aid decisions by the Commission on some national tax schemes or the progressive abolition of roaming charges across the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Consistency in integration is equally important – if not more so – for the half-finished construction of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">I understand very well, as a European citizen, why political attention is today focused on security and addressing the challenges of migration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">But Europe will not build the resources needed to protect itself and manage migration flows without a strong and sustainable economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Making our Economic and Monetary Union strong and sustainable requires a complete banking union and elements of a fiscal and economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.95,0)">None of us want to live in a half-built house because it will get very uncomfortable as soon as the next storm hits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">We need to work on completing EMU also after Brexit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.71,0)">Today, there are clear disagreements on the balance between private and public risk-sharing, on the mix of national and EMU-wide responsibilities, and on the speed towards possible new arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This discussion will take time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In my view, it should be embedded more broadly in a new convergence process, as suggested in the Five Presidents’ Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Significant progress towards common convergence criteria would be regularly monitored and would be a condition for members to benefit from further risk-sharing instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This way the convergence process would set a clear incentive structure for Member States to overcome the current deadlock and would establish full transparency about the design of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">However, for new projects and further integration steps there must be a consensus that joint action is truly necessary and linked to people’s needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">And we know from surveys  that there are areas where citizens would like the EU to become more active than at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.52,0)">On that note, I want return very briefly to an aspect that is really for another speech or maybe even another speaker – someone not from the central banking world – to address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.12,0)">It is the lack of confidence between Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Common fora for debate As I have said before, we need to be honest with ourselves: the Single Market and Economic and Monetary Union are not technocratic mechanisms but inherently political undertakings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">And as political undertakings they require support and acceptance beyond the legitimacy gained via elected national governments or even through the provision of effective and efficient solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As laid down in the Treaty, supranational law and supranational institutions assume that we are not only nationals of our respective countries but also citizens of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Being European citizens is in turn linked to a feeling of common identity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The late President Ciampi embraced this principle emphatically: Our common historical legacy, the awareness of possessing a European identity, our membership of a single value system, the principle of shared sovereignty mark out European citizenship and identify the European Union; they underpin its institutional, political and economic scaffolding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">A common identity allows us to accept that the political undertakings we pursue together can temporarily produce losers and winners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It enables the minority to accept the decisions taken by the majority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.78,0)">When such an acceptance is not there but only national interests and national perspectives prevail, then confidence between Europeans is seriously undermined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">One way of strengthening these conceptual underpinnings of Europe in my view would be to create more space for common debates on European issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.76,0)">Let me be clear: having common debates should not be understood as having the same view at all times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is absolutely normal to disagree and it is entirely natural considering that the people of Europe have different histories, have grown up in different circumstances and express a wide variety of preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.34,0)">However, the problem starts when we are having 28 or 19 different discussions without channelling them into a common debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.81,0)">Too often, domestic media and political actors take a national perspective in these debates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.1,0)">Too often the debtor-creditor dichotomy overshadows the debate of how we want to organise the economic governance of the euro area in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.55,0)">The result is a fragmentation of the democratic debate on Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This fragmentation is heightened by intergovernmental decision-making that involves endless negotiations and highlights the differences between the positions of various Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.91,0)">And such a fragmentation of our discourse sets a trap: the more divided we become over common solutions, the less effort we put into implementing them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.48,0)">As a result, Europe cannot deliver effectively and European policies, once again, appear ineffective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.2,0)">This only adds to people’s impatience and dissatisfaction with Europe, making it even more difficult to find effective European solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">To overcome this fragmentation we need to reinforce our common fora for debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The European Parliament is an important element, but we should foster dialogues between Europeans also outside of existing institutional structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">The result should be a positive “politicisation” of the EU , on which I understand analytical work is also being carried out here at the institute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.8,0)">Conclusions Confidence in Europe and among Europeans is low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">And there are clearly areas where we need to do much better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">National governments need to live up to their responsibilities for fiscal and economic policies, and we need a clear and consistent path of integration to avoid half-built houses and allow Europe to deliver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">A new convergence process can offer such a path to break the deadlock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">And achieving this goal will be much easier if we strengthen our common fora for debate and decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This requires political leadership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">But it also will help to meet citizens’ demands for a more effective Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">We should have confidence in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.82,0)">As Winston Churchill once said, “For myself, I am an optimist — it does not seem to be much use being anything else”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I now look forward to your questions and our discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">I would like to thank
