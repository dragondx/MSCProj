    <span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)"> Introductory remarks to panel ‘Lessons from Latvia and the Baltics’ Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, High-level conference on Latvia, Riga, 5 June 2012 Dear ladies and gentlemen, It is my pleasure to be here today in Riga to discuss the lessons from the Baltic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.94,0)">In the Hanseatic League, to which Riga and other Baltic cities belonged, commerce and politics went hand in hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.96,0)">And history is never far away from the headlines of the day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.22,0)">The ongoing financial and sovereign debt crisis illustrates yet again how closely economics and politics interact – for good or for bad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I would like to structure my intervention around the following three main questions: What makes the Latvian experience so special in the context of the current crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">What can euro area countries learn from the Baltic recovery?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">What can Latvia itself learn from its adjustment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.87,0)">When good economics coincides with good politics It is said that “good economics is often bad politics” and vice versa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.93,0)">The experience of Latvia and more generally the Baltics is worth exploring precisely because it defied this conventional wisdom – both economically and politically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.21,0)">First, it disproved the frequently made claim that an internal devaluation strategy cannot work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.47,0)">From 2008, Latvia was faced with the deepest recession in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.87,0)">The cumulative output decline was 24%; unemployment peaked at 20%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Compared with this economic collapse, even some of the euro area peripheral countries were faring relatively better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.58,0)">Keeping the euro peg was considered by many as a “mission impossible”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.75,0)">External devaluation was presented as the only way forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But Latvia did not choose the easy “quick fix”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">It embarked on a courageous fiscal consolidation path and structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Two years later, the speed of the economic rebound is as extraordinary as the depth of the recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Against all the odds, Latvia recorded a real GDP growth rate of 5.5% in 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">While domestic demand was the main driver of growth last year, exports have also recovered very strongly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Evidently, Latvia’s competitiveness has improved, even though many challenges still lie ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The economic dynamics behind this swift stabilisation and recovery merit close examination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Equally interesting is the political economy of the Baltic adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Jean-Claude Juncker once said: “we all know what to do but we don’t know how to get re-elected afterwards”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.97,0)">This saying, often referred to as “Juncker’s curse”, unfortunately seems to be confirmed by the crisis in vast segments of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.83,0)">Italy, Greece, Ireland, Portugal: in all of these countries the government fell directly as a result of its handling of the economic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.25,0)">Latvia seems to be the exception to the rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Despite harsh austerity measures the Prime Minister managed to get re-elected twice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Many ruling politicians in Europe these days may look upon this with incredulous admiration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.7,0)">Why was the internal devaluation strategy effective in Latvia and the Baltics, while other countries are still struggling with a deep economic and political crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">It is worth drawing lessons from the Baltic experience for euro area member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Lessons for euro area member countries Let me start with fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The Baltic experience shows clearly that speed is of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.72,0)">In all three Baltic countries, the government reacted swiftly to the deterioration of public finances and frontloaded fiscal adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">With a budget consolidation of around 9% of GDP in 2009 alone, Latvia’s effort is unparalleled in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Undertaking the necessary austerity measures at an early stage had a triple beneficial effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">First, it allowed the Baltics to benefit from positive confidence effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Second, it allowed Latvia to return to the financial markets well ahead of schedule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Third, it allowed growth to bounce back after exceptionally severe output contractions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In 2011 the Baltic countries were the three best performers in the EU in terms of GDP growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">At a time when all euro area policy-makers urgently seek ways to relaunch growth, this is a remarkable achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.94,0)">The concept of “expansionary contraction” has been used and criticised in the ongoing debate about growth and austerity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The Baltic experience provides an indication that this need not be an oxymoron: even if fiscal consolidation weighs on the growth prospects in the short term, it has sizeable positive effects in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">But this frontloading approach also proved effective from a political perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">By acting with speed and determination, the Latvian government was able to capture the sense of urgency prevailing among the population and mobilise it to support adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This way, most of the required painful budgetary decisions could be passed before the so-called “adjustment fatigue” kicked in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.57,0)">The bottom line is this: when adjustment is inevitable, it is better to take the medicine right away than to let the fever rise for months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This is undoubtedly an important factor that explains the different trajectories of the Baltics and certain southern European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">But fiscal consolidation alone would not have allowed the Baltics to exit the crisis so swiftly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The ECB has long argued that the potential trade-off between fiscal discipline and growth can be mitigated if consolidation is accompanied by growth-enhancing structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The case of the Baltics confirms this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">From a political economy perspective, the Latvian experience also shows that a critical mass of structural reforms is helpful to overcome vested interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.96,0)">Education, health care, central administration: hardly any public sector category was spared by the reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Combined with targeted social safety net measures, this comprehensive approach helped the government to foster public acceptance of change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.72,0)">At the same time, the quality and long-term sustainability of the reforms may – at least initially – have suffered from this approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Structural reforms are not just about across-the-board cuts but are much more complex and multifaceted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Their overarching objective should be to create a favourable policy environment for growth and wealth creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But they should also bear in mind equity considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In that regard, the IMF, the European Commission and the World Bank provided valuable advice and support to Latvia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">I am convinced that we Europeans can and should also step up our technical assistance to countries in need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The Fiscal Compact and the two-pack can provide a good basis for that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">To be effective, they should be implemented in a spirit of mutual trust by the Member States and the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Last but not least, an important lesson from the Baltics relates to the existence of a broad consensus in society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In my view, beyond economic specificities, the key difference between, say, Latvia and Greece lies in the degree of national ownership of the adjustment programme – not only by national policy-makers but also by the population itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">I cannot but emphasise this again: national ownership and public support for the adjustment programme – these are key lessons from the Latvian experience which are of the utmost relevance to the current situation in Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In that regard, the communication policy of the government plays a crucial role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This is what a responsible government ought to do: to state that the adjustment is for the country’s own good, and not just to please international lenders; to tell the hard truth; to explain what needs to be done; to be clear what the consequences of non-action or of alternative policy choices would be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">All this is conducive to public acceptance of the programme and, therefore, its success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">And this is also in the enlightened self-interest of the government, as the electoral reward of the Latvian Prime Minister demonstrates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Beyond economic considerations, the adjustment programme has to be put into a broader context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Political factors can also be key justifications for undertaking difficult economic measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">In the case of the Baltics, the ultimate objective of adopting the euro also has a geostrategic dimension, namely completing their firm anchoring in a Union based on freedom, democracy and human rights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In fact, sharing a currency is more than just drawing economic benefits; it means being part of a community with a shared destiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This project of political integration justifies making short-term sacrifices to join – or stay within – the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">To sum up, a speedy fiscal adjustment, a critical mass of structural reforms and a strong national ownership: these were, in my view, the key ingredients of the Baltic recipe for a quick economic rebound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">There is, of course, no silver bullet that could be applied universally to all countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Nevertheless, euro area policy-makers should look closely at the recent experience of the Baltic countries and draw the appropriate lessons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">I see at least one encouraging take-home message: if properly designed and effectively communicated, if fully supported by international lenders, economic adjustment does not necessarily imply political suicide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Lessons for Latvia Being here in Riga, let me conclude with a few observations about the lessons for Latvia itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.37,0)">The end of the programme should not mean the end of the adjustment efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Key challenges remain also for this country to ensure the sustainability of the fiscal adjustment, to strengthen the fundamental drivers of sustainable and balanced growth and to prevent macroeconomic imbalances from building up again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">As regards euro adoption, the challenges that some euro area countries are currently facing illustrate clearly the importance of sustainable convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Very careful preparation is required to make sure that convergence continues also after euro adoption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.92,0)">Measures to reduce inflation temporarily or easily reversible measures to lower the fiscal deficit do not represent sustainable convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The decision to adopt the euro is a very fundamental one and should not be taken lightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The ECB published its Convergence Report 2012 last week and we came to the conclusion that Latvia does not yet fulfil all convergence requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">So there is still a way to go for Latvia and the euro will not come for free.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.24,0)">But let me state very clearly that the euro area is not a closed club.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">It is open to any EU Member State that fulfils the convergence criteria on a sustainable basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Conclusion The Baltic experience demonstrates that euro membership is not just about economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.21,0)">The economics alone make only for a partial analysis of the failure or success of an adjustment programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.77,0)">The political motivations – such as the determination to join the euro area or to safeguard the political capital invested in EMU – have often been underestimated by markets during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">I firmly believe that both economic and political arguments will ultimately also prevail in countries currently in the middle of an adjustment process that is similarly painful to Latvia’s experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
