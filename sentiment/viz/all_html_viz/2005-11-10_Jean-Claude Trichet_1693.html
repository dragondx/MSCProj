    <h1> Growth potential, labour productivity and structural reforms in Europe </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB Annual Dinner Lloyd's, London, 10 November 2005 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)"> Growth potential, labour productivity and structural reforms in Europe Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBAnnual Dinner Lloyd’s,London, 10 November 2005 Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Lord Levene for inviting me here today and allowing me to share with you my views on some key issues for the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The topic of my speech will focus on the recent growth performance and the outlook for the euro area economy in the medium to long term, in particular by drawing comparison with the other major economy of the world, the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Starting with a diagnosis of the growth performance of the euro area, I will then try to identify the reasons why Europe has been lagging behind in the recent years: in this respect, it appears that the gap with the United States can largely be explained by a difference in productivity growth on each side of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Finally, I will also touch upon the challenges and the remedies for the euro area ahead, namely the absolute need to resolutely implement structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Relative growth performance The economic well being of the European people, as elsewhere, depends on a number of factors, but one fundamental factor is represented by the amount of goods and services that are available on average for each of us, that is, real output per capita.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Let me discuss the development of this key macroeconomic measure for the euro area and the forces which can explain its evolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">A comparative perspective with developments in the US can offer useful insights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Indeed, from a long term perspective, a comparison of real output per capita developments between the euro area and the US is not always unfavourable for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">For example, since the early 1960s real output per capita growth has been on average slightly higher in the euro area than in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">From 1980 onwards developments have been on average similar, with real output per capita growth being on average just below 2% in both economic areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.47,0)">However, these average figures conceal very different patterns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.64,0)">While in the euro area real output per capita growth has been gradually declining over the past four decades from almost 5% during the 1960s to just below 2% in the 1990s, in the US it declined slightly between the 1960s and 1970s but then stabilised in the two subsequent decades from just below 3% in the 1960s to just above 2% in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.1,0)">Hence, while up to the 1970s average real output per capita growth was higher in the euro area, in the 1980s it was similar and in the 1990s it became lower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.07,0)">More recently, since the mid-90s, while in the euro area trend real output per capita growth continued to gradually decline, in the US it even started to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.28,0)">As a result of these relative growth patterns, the level of euro area real output per capita which was gradually catching up with the US level up to the early 1980s   appeared to stop converging and then, since mid 1990s, the relative level has slightly started to fall again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Productivity is the key to prosperity What then can explain these different output per capita growth patterns?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">There are various immediate sources of output per capita growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.65,0)">These can be classified into three main categories: labour productivity, labour utilisation and demographic factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Labour utilisation, which depends on factors such as average hours worked, the unemployment rate and the participation rate, can explain a significant part of the growth dynamics reviewed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.72,0)">For example, average hours worked have been declining during most of the past 40 years in the euro area, although in the recent decade to a lesser extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.68,0)">By contrast, in the US after declining up to the 1980s, they have been broadly stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.12,0)">As a result, while in 1970 euro area workers were working about the same number of hours per person as US workers, by 2004 we are working just 85% of what North-American are doing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.83,0)">Moreover, despite some recent improvements in the most recent decade, the unemployment rate is significantly higher in the euro area and has declined less since the mid-1990s than in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.98,0)">By contrast, the participation rate has been increasing more strongly in the euro area than in the US since the 1990s, but this was possible due to the significantly lower initial level of participation we had in the euro area .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Also demographic factors, in particular the gradual process of ageing of the population, have been relevant and will undoubtedly become an important challenge, looking ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">However, I would like to focus today on labour productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">There are good reasons to focus mainly on this factor of growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">We know, since at least the pioneering contributions of Professor Robert Solow to growth theory in the late 1950s, that productivity growth is the key factor to long term economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.0,0)">For the euro area this is confirmed by the fact that almost all of the average growth in real output per capita was determined by labour productivity growth in all of the past four decades, while the contribution from labour utilisation has been most often negative and demographic factors-or the changing age structure- have provided a very modest contribution in most decades since 1960, which turned even negative in the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Similarly, also for the US, labour productivity growth has been the main driving force of real output per capita growth in the past few decades, although on average to a lesser extent compared to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.85,0)">As regards labour productivity growth, from a longer term perspective the euro area and the US have one aspect in common: a decline in average productivity growth after the early 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.36,0)">Unfortunately, while the stylised facts characterising this productivity growth slowdown are well documented, its causes are still debated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Various possible explanations have been proposed, ranging from sectoral shifts, to the impact of the oil shocks of the 1970s, to increasing measurement problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, none seems to provide a fully satisfactory interpretation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.84,0)">More recently, labour productivity growth developments have diverged between the euro area and the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">While on average productivity growth was broadly unchanged between the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, both in the euro area and the US, a substantial change can be observed in the second half of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.84,0)">In the euro area, average productivity growth  , after growing on average by about 2.5% from 1980 to 1995, declined to just above 1.5% in the period 1995-2000 and further to just above 1.0% on average in the period 2000-2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">By contrast in the US, growth in productivity per hour worked, after averaging just below 1.5% from 1980 to 1995, rose to an average of just below 2% in the period 1995-2000 and to just below 3% over the period 2000-2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This rise in the US may partly reflect cyclical factors, but the apparent resilience of productivity growth during the past downturn and the significant further pick-up over the last two years tends to support the widespread view that the mid-1990s marked a structural improvement in US productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.2,0)">I should note that the assessment that productivity growth in the euro area has fallen behind the US in the second half of the 1990s is independent of the way labour productivity growth is measured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.28,0)">Downward trends in productivity growth are observed for the euro area irrespective of whether productivity is measured per person employed or per hour worked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.92,0)">However, it is worth noting that due to the trend decline in average hours worked in the euro area  , the productivity growth gap with the US is more marked in terms of employed persons than in terms of hours worked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Given then this striking recent divergence, it is worthwhile to focus on productivity developments since the mid-1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.23,0)">Proximate causes of labour productivity growth divergences The decline in euro area labour productivity growth since the mid-1990s can be discussed in terms of its main immediate sources, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">total factor productivity growth, changes in labour quality and capital deepening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Total factor productivity is a measure that corresponds to the theoretical concept of technological progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">However, in practice it captures the impact of several factors  , such that it is not immediate to associate its evolution to purely technological advances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Capital deepening is the increase in capital intensity, which is the amount of capital per unit of labour input.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.67,0)">Although the decomposition of labour productivity is subject to significant measurement uncertainty, there seems to be robust evidence that slower productivity growth in the euro area since the mid-1990s reflects both less capital deepening and lower growth in total factor productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.71,0)">During the period 1995-2000, capital deepening was only half of that observed over the period 1990-1995, hence accounting for a large part of the slowdown in aggregate labour productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">While increases in Information and Communication Technology   investment are estimated to have had a positive, albeit limited, effect on the contribution of ICT capital deepening since the mid-1990s, this was more than compensated for by lower capital deepening in non-ICT.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Available evidence also suggests that labour quality increased more moderately in recent years than in the first half of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Comparing the factors driving US labour productivity growth shows striking differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">The increasing contributions from ICT capital deepening and total factor productivity since the mid-1990s stand in stark contrast to developments in the euro area and results from accelerating investment in ICT and a higher growth in measured total factor productivity in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In fact, the shares of ICT investment in GDP and the pace of ICT capital deepening were both higher in the US, thus contributing to the labour productivity growth gap between the two economic areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Diverging trends in total factor productivity growth are also remarkable, with the US showing significant improvements in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The decomposition of labour productivity growth per hour worked at the sectoral level sheds more light on the different developments in labour productivity growth in the euro area and the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.0,0)">The main features of sectoral productivity contributions can be summarised as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.6,0)">First, a significant deceleration in hourly labour productivity in non-ICT sectors from the first half of the 1990s explains most of the decline in euro area aggregate labour productivity growth over the late 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">Second, productivity developments in the ICT producing sectors were in recent years relatively strong in the euro area, and even outperformed slightly the US in the segment of ICT producing services  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.42,0)">However, this sector represents a smaller share of the economy in the euro area than in the US, which implies that positive developments had a more limited impact on aggregate productivity in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.85,0)">Third, the ICT using sectors in the euro area failed to experience the strong acceleration in labour productivity observed in the US in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.94,0)">In particular, key ICT using services such as retail, wholesale and financial services saw broadly stable, or slightly lower, productivity growth in recent years in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">At the same time productivity growth in these sectors surged in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.7,0)">This accounts for a large part of the difference in aggregate productivity growth between the euro area and the US   over the period 1996-2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">More fundamental factors To fully understand the sources of labour productivity growth it is useful to differentiate between immediate and more fundamental sources of labour productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The immediate sources of labour productivity growth consist of those we have just discussed, namely total factor productivity growth, capital deepening and increases in labour quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.98,0)">Each of the immediate sources is the result of more fundamental factors that in turn depend on institutions and preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">For example, total factor productivity growth may depend on innovation, research and development   spending and technology diffusion, which in turn are influenced by institutional factors, such as regulations, and preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.15,0)">Unfortunately, research on these more fundamental sources of labour productivity growth has not yet reached clear conclusions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">While theoretical work has clearly identified important factors  and indicated that interactions between the various fundamental factors may play an important role,  more empirical work is needed to further pin down the relative importance of these factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The need for structural reforms Since the interactions between fundamental factors and economic policies are very complex, more research is clearly needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Nevertheless, it is clear to my eyes that economic policies geared towards enhancing the contribution of fundamental factors will be beneficial to long term productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">A number of European policy initiatives and recommendations - in particular within the framework of the Lisbon strategy - to promote productivity growth in the euro area have been made by expert groups, including the recommendations in the Sapir report of July 2003 and the more recent Kok report of November 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">A number of these recommendations are reflected also in the recent mid-term review of the Lisbon agenda which seeks to tackle the triple challenge of globalisation, ageing populations and rapid technological change within a stability-oriented macroeconomic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">In particular, one of the key priorities identified in the mid-term review is to promote “knowledge and innovation for growth” which includes a number of recommendations concerning human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">These recommendations go in the right direction and if implemented rigorously are likely to go a long way towards addressing the main fundamental determinants of long-term productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">For example, the Lisbon strategy sets a target that research and development spending should reach 3% of GDP by 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Moreover, in an environment of necessary fiscal prudence, two thirds of this spending should come from the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In 2003, overall expenditure stood at 1.9% of GDP for the European Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">By way of comparison, the U.S. spends 2.6% of GDP on research and development  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">In order to achieve the targets set by the Lisbon strategy we in Europe we need more scientists and researchers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Considering that in the European Union we have only about 5.3 scientists and researchers per 1000 workforce, which compares to a figure of 9 scientists and researchers per 1000 workforce in the US, it is not surprising that more innovations take place across the Atlantic Ocean.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">But we should focus equally on increasing the quality of our research: this is a key factor, as it can attract new young brilliant investigators, which in turn would bring new original ideas and ignite a virtuous spiral of better and better achievements and conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This has become even more important today, with globalisation affecting not only finance and trade but increasingly more also research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Other broad policy measures include more and better education and training, which are required to minimise mismatches in the labour market and allow for a smoother reallocation of workers between sectors and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.67,0)">A comparison with the U.S. illustrates the knowledge gap: in the US, annual expenditure on higher education institutions per student represents 57.8% of GDP per capita, while in the euro area only 35% is spent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In addition, it is clear that establishing competitive, efficient and well functioning markets is another prerequisite in order to enhance medium to long-term growth, not to mention the shorter term impact of increasing the resilience of the economy to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">In the EU, some progress has been made in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">For example, most network industries are now fully or largely open to competition, in particular those in telecommunications and air transport and to a lesser extent in energy markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">And the reforms do pay off: the remarkable labour productivity growth performance in network industries in Europe over the last ten years provides a perfect example of the positive impact on labour productivity growth of easing regulations and fostering competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Overall, although we have to recognise our limited knowledge on important issues regarding the concrete importance of the fundamental sources of growth and their interactions, it is clear that a number of measures, such as those indicated in the Lisbon strategy, cannot but be beneficial for the euro area economy and may even become necessary to sustain our economic well being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me conclude with a comment on a well-known remark by Professor Solow, who   wrote in 1987 that “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Less than ten years after this remark, computers started to appear forcefully also in the productivity statistics, at least in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">A similar remark to that of Professor Solow in 1987 could be made not only today, but possibly also ten or more years ago, for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We can see also in Europe computers, the internet, mobile phones, iPods and so on everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.6,0)">The ICT revolution affected not only the US economy, but also the euro area and other regions of the developed world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We cannot afford to remain passive and hope that the computer age will soon be reflected in productivity statistics for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">There are important reasons why this has not happened yet: what is essential is not only the quality of the seed but also the fertility of the soil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">We need structural reforms to make sure that the soil is fertile enough for the seeds of technological progress to produce the fruits leading to higher productivity growth and per capita output growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">We know what we have to do, the way has been identified in the Lisbon strategy and the first steps have been taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">That way needs now to be followed in a more decisive manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Only in this way can per capita output growth be sustained, thereby supporting economic prosperity today, and in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">It was just above 2.5% per year in the euro area and about 2¼% in the US, from 1960 to 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.0,0)">According to OECD data, average hours worked per year in the euro area declined from about 1940 in 1970 to about 1550 in 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.23,0)">According to OECD data, average hours worked per year in the US declined from about 1935 in 1970 to about 1830 in 1982 and then stabilised around 1860 up to 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.69,0)">In 2004 they were about 1825.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The participation rate is estimated by the European Commission at about bout 72% in the euro area and about 76% in the US in 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Solow, Robert M.  : "A Contribution to the Theory of Economic Growth."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.03,0)">Quarterly
