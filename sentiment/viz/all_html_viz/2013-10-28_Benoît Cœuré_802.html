    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.41,0)"> Lessons from East Asia for the euro area Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Asia Europe Economic Forum on “Challenges and Prospects for Asian and European Economies",Beijing, 28 October 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen,   The global economic and financial crisis confronted the world economy not only with financial turbulence, loss in output and social distress on a scale not seen since the Great Depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.79,0)">It also created a series of challenges for policy- makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.35,0)">Across the euro area, it exposed structural and institutional weaknesses that had remained hidden during the preceding era, the “Great Moderation”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Times of crisis are times of hardship – but they are also times of change and opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">This seems particularly true for Europe, where progress has often come in this way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The Second World War was the impetus for the European Coal and Steel Community, which was established to prevent another war between France and Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It formed the nucleus of today’s European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The demise of the Bretton Woods system in the 1970s was the catalyst for a European single currency, which was eventually introduced in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I’ll be talking today about the effects of the present crisis and the various challenges it has presented for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.87,0)">I’ll compare it with the East Asian crisis of 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">In my view, there are similarities that yield useful policy lessons for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But there are also differences that need to be kept in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">What can we learn from the Asian crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.02,0)">What are the parallels between the Asian crisis in 1997-1998 and the euro area crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The economies of emerging Asia were characterised by buoyant growth and a brisk expansion of credit  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This rise in debt was facilitated by considerable inflows of foreign capital, which financed significant external deficits  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.96,0)">This led to growing financial imbalances, and in particular to currency and maturity mismatches on the balance sheets of local banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.03,0)">In addition, the economic boom prevailing at that time was accompanied by a loss of competitiveness of the region’s export sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.91,0)">Investors typically under-priced potential risks as they had overly optimistic expectations of the medium-term growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.5,0)">They did not identify systemic vulnerabilities such as the risk of sudden stops in capital flows or of twin crises of the banking system and the balance of payments, which eventually materialised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Except for currency mismatches, similar developments were evident in the euro area before 2009 – if not at the regional level, at least in those countries that later ran into financial difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.17,0)">It was widely believed that sudden stops in capital flows, not to mention twin banking and balance of payments crises, could not happen in advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.35,0)">And yet this is exactly what happened in Europe ten years after the Asian crisis  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">It seems therefore useful to look also at East Asia’s response to its crisis and see what lessons can be learned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">One lesson is that a deep and fundamental restructuring of the domestic financial sector is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Given the financial nature of the Asian crisis, this was a key element in resolving it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Non-viable financial institutions were closed, viable institutions recapitalised and strengthened, value-impaired assets dealt with and the corporate sector restructured, including through foreign investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">These measures were implemented decisively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">They were associated with a painful adjustment process in the crisis countries but, at the same time, they made a swift recovery possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.5,0)">This experience contrasts with Japan’s experience in the late 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.67,0)">Following the bursting of Japan’s asset bubble, there was by and large no rapid write-down of non-performing assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.9,0)">Due to the low profitability of banks, it was believed that an immediate write-off of bad loans would prevent compliance with capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.72,0)">The recognition of losses was postponed and, as a consequence, capital continued to be allocated to investments with limited positive impact on Japan’s long-term growth potential, which some have called “zombie lending”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.94,0)">Ultimately, this resulted in Japan’s “lost decade”, namely an extended period of anaemic growth  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">A second lesson is that institutional and structural reforms are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Early in the crisis, emerging Asian economies strengthened prudential regulation and supervision, together with bank governance and market transparency and discipline, in order to prevent further instability and bring domestic standards closer to the international norms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.55,0)">Furthermore, they generally acknowledged that their economic “miracle” before the crisis was not sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.99,0)">It was driven by over-investment encouraged by Colbertist policies, implicit government guarantees, and too often, opaqueness and political interference in market mechanisms  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">As a result, at the macro level, growth was led by capital accumulation in the wrong sectors and not by a rise in total factor productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In Paul Krugman’s words, the Asian miracle was “the fruit of perspiration, not of inspiration”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">To address the root causes of the crisis, structural reforms aimed at improving governance and challenging vested interests, both in public policy-making and in the corporate sector, were essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The lesson to be learnt was that sustainable growth can only be achieved by fostering an environment that encourages open markets, innovation and entrepreneurship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.99,0)">A third lesson is that re-nationalisation and protectionism are not the solution to a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Indeed, there is empirical evidence that more open economies recover faster from the output contraction that usually accompanies a sudden stop of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.92,0)">As such, the most open Asian economies, such as Hong Kong and Singapore, were among the least severely affected and fastest to recover from the Asian crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">In other words, despite the attendant risks, globalisation in trade is still the best way to achieve progress and economic development, and open financial markets can support it provided they are backed by strong prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Open trade policies in the crisis helped Asian economies to benefit from the upswing in global trade and growth towards the turn of the millennium  , which in turn supported the post-crisis recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">However, while there may be lessons to learn, what are the important differences between emerging Asia of the 1990s and the euro area today?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Emerging Asian economies had greater policy leeway than euro area countries in dealing with their crises, in that they had flexible exchange rate regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.01,0)">Some might argue that this makes it hard to say which part of the Asian experience is relevant for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.76,0)">But I would have a different interpretation: a lack of nominal exchange rate flexibility does not preclude real exchange rate adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Sharing a currency entails a fundamental trade-off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It brings considerable microeconomic benefits but it creates responsibilities for participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">They should run prudent policies to make asymmetric shocks less frequent, ensure that relative prices can adjust if such a shock nevertheless occurs, and be prepared to insure each other against extreme outcomes when the former mechanisms are not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.33,0)">The conditions were unfortunately not met in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.22,0)">National policies were run on the misguided assumption that countries, companies and households could borrow forever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">In spite of needing more flexible markets with its single currency, Europe faced stronger nominal rigidities than East Asia in labour and product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.84,0)">This limited the ability of euro area countries to adjust to asymmetric shocks, especially as cross-border labour mobility was low and public debt levels were already high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.07,0)">And finally, no mutual insurance mechanism was in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">But, and here comes the good news, unlike emerging Asia in the late 1990s, Europe had a well-established regional political framework to address its crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The framework of integration and cooperation among EU members is old and dense, building on the experience gained with the European Monetary System  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">This made it possible to create the necessary instruments   for financial support for domestic adjustment programmes to come mainly from within the Union, with the IMF focusing on monitoring conditionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.19,0)">Some will remember the IMF Annual Meetings in 1997 in Hong Kong, when calls to create an “Asian Monetary Fund” were judged incompatible with the IMF’s universal mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Contrary to Asia in the late 1990s, Europe had the political infrastructure in place to sustain the sharing of sovereignty that makes mutual insurance mechanisms possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is not to say that all the discussions were easy, far from it, as might be expected in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.99,0)">Europe’s sense of commonality was, and still is, under severe strain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But the political framework was there to produce decisions, and most importantly, a legal framework was also there to implement them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The lesson from this is that regional integration, regional rule of law, and the sense of a common project are sources of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">In East Asia, things have moved on since the late 1990s, with the Chiang Mai Initiative multilateralisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The G20 has taken stock of the Asian and European experiences and acknowledged the relevance of regional financial arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The road ahead for the euro area Based on the lessons learnt from the Asian crisis, what are the main challenges we face in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me consider them one by one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Restructuring Europe’s financial sector To begin with, we need to reform Europe’s financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">We have, so to speak, come to a crossroads in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In one direction lies the Japanese experience, and in the other direction that of emerging East Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.68,0)">The authorities can either choose between swiftly auditing and repairing the banking sector, which will help to restore credit flows, or they can allow forbearance, which will harm the long-term prospects for our economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I do not mean to downplay the significant restructuring and recapitalisation that has already taken place in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Since the onset of the global financial crisis, euro area banks have raised around €225 billion of fresh capital and a further €275 billion has been injected by governments, equivalent in total to more than 5% of euro area GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Today, the median Core Tier 1 capital ratio of the largest euro area banks stands close to 12%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But there is some way to go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">To ensure that we take the right road, I see three responses as key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The first is to carry out a comprehensive clean-up of the banking system so that the price mechanism is no longer obscured by uncertainty about asset valuation and bank funding models, and banks can free up balance sheet capacity to extend new loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The ECB will take up its supervisory responsibilities in about a year from now, and as part of this we will conduct a comprehensive assessment of 128 significant credit institutions covering 85% of euro area bank assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We announced the details of this exercise on Wednesday last week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">It aims to increase transparency, to identify the necessary corrective actions and to build confidence in the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">With such steps, and provided that sources of capital are clearly identified, including public backstops when private sources have been exhausted, I firmly believe we can put the banking system on a sounder footing and enable it to support the economy’s recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The second response is to reduce financial fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Despite having a single market for capital in Europe, liquidity is not fully fungible between and even within cross-border banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This means that liquidity usage is not optimised – surpluses in some countries are not used to fund deficits in others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.66,0)">The result is a greater divergence in bank funding costs and lending rates than would be warranted by the underlying economic fundamentals, and euro area companies being unable to tap a single pool of savings to fund their development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">The third response is to explore avenues for non-bank financing – that is, to develop debt and equity capital markets in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.68,0)">Around 75% of firms’ external financing in the euro area comes from banks, which makes the economy particularly vulnerable to crises that spread through the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Measures are being introduced in Europe to develop capital markets for long-term financing and deepen markets for the securitisation of loans to small and medium-sized enterprises  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">However, having a well-functioning financial sector is only one part of the story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.53,0)">To leave the crisis behind us, we also have to ask: what in fact does that sector finance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Again, we can learn from the Asian crisis: we need to foster growth and total factor productivity with new business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.33,0)">Fostering growth: new business models Due to its length and severity, the economic downturn has already caused a permanent loss in output and a rise in structural unemployment, and we cannot rule out that the growth rate of potential output has been affected too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">To repair this damage, investment in both physical and human capital has to be a key component of the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Clearly, there is spare capacity in the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.38,0)">Total investment in the euro area is currently 17% lower than it was in 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">But some of this capacity is in sectors which will not be future engines of growth – such as commercial real estate in some of the stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">What we need is investment in new business models that will raise total factor productivity and provide the sources of future growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.45,0)">Politicians are not the best placed to decide what these business models will be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The market economy will take care of that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">The important thing is that we create an environment that encourages innovation and entrepreneurship so that new models can emerge, and capital and labour can be reallocated to a more efficient use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is in the best interests of the people of Europe, both as workers and as savers, beginning with those who have been hit hardest by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">It nevertheless implies changes at both national and European levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">At national level, we need to prioritise public spending towards productivity-enhancing investment, ensure that labour and goods market are flexible, cultivate a supportive regulatory, judicial and educational environment, and open our economies to spur competition and encourage the emergence of new actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.7,0)">Opaqueness and vested interests   are not only defining features of developing economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Successful reform in European economies hinges on efforts to curb rent-seeking behaviours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">For example, doesn’t the Single Supervisory Mechanism have the objective of freeing bank supervision from national politics?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">At European level, we need to provide a framework that supports and incentivises the introduction of such national policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is the role of economic union in the euro area, the “E” of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I would stress, however, that economic union does not mean defining a single economic model across all countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">On the contrary, its purpose is to create the conditions for each country to identify and develop its comparative advantage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Paradoxically, it is only by encouraging difference – comparative advantage – that the euro area can achieve convergence – that is, a more even distribution of economic outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Avoiding re-nationalisation and protectionism Let me finally address the third lesson learnt from East Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Europe needs to avoid protectionist temptations and calls for re-nationalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.74,0)">Protectionism and beggar-thy-neighbour policies would lead to further losses of welfare at both European and global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Fortunately, there has been no significant surge in barriers to global trade in recent years – unlike during the Great Depression – thanks to global and regional policy coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">These efforts remain important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Barriers to trade in goods and services cannot be raised within Europe thanks to our Single Market and competition rules which are enshrined in European laws, but the Single Market can be further enhanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.27,0)">Savings have been partly re-nationalised as a consequence of financial fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.07,0)">This is a trend that, if left unchecked, can be fatal to the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Completing the Banking Union is key to halt it, and I welcome EU leaders’ resolve to swiftly agree on a Single Resolution Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Finally, Europe should remain open to the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Further progress on bilateral or regional free trade agreements, and cooperation in implementing the new financial regulatory standards, are the best signal in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Conclusion Let me draw to a close by re-emphasising that crises, despite their negative consequences, can have positive effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">They can galvanise efforts and focus minds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">They can drive change and bring about progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">They can pave the way for innovative solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">But to secure these gains, cooperation across national borders is crucial, in other words, there must be a willingness to work towards common goals and to learn from each other and resist protectionism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">This spirit will be essential to tackle the challenges still ahead of us, not only in the euro area but also at a global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.82,0)">It is often claimed that the Chinese and Japanese word for crisis, wēijī or kiki  , is made of the two characters meaning “danger” and “opportunity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">While there can be no doubt that wēi means “danger”, I would rather understand jī as meaning the critical moment when things have to change – the ancient Greeks’ kairos.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This critical moment has now arrived for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Europe has emerged from the danger zone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">It’s time for us to get our act together, to reform, and to grow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I remain solely responsible for the opinions
