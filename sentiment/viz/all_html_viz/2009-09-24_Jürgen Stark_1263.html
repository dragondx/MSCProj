we can travel without paying a commission to exchange money within the euro area or transfer money within this area and pay the same fee as for a national transfer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In all euro area countries, we can simply hand over some cash or give the cashier a payment card or have the amount due transferred from our bank account to another account with one click of a mouse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">However, we should not forget that it has not always been this easy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In this respect, the exhibition is a worthwhile attempt to make people more familiar with the language of money, as money is an integral part of our society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The importance of money in the modern economy is such that it is crucial to be proactive in educating all citizens about how to deal with their own financial affairs in a responsible and cautious manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This exhibition explains the various forms that money can take.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">I should also like to take this opportunity to highlight the fruitful cooperation between the European Central Bank and the Museum für Kommunikation which has given the ECB the opportunity to display its “Euro Exhibition” in the museum’s premises from 20 November 2009 until 17 January 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">I do not want to reveal too many details at this stage, but, as you may have a chance to discover for yourselves later this year, the “Euro Exhibition” features a common theme that will naturally complement the exhibition on the “Language of Money”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It will tell you all about the euro banknotes and how to detect counterfeits in an interactive and entertaining manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">You will be able to learn how the euro aids communication and connection between the people in Europe and the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">I should therefore like to warmly invite you to this exhibition, which opens on 20 November here at the Museum für Kommunikation in Berlin, before it continues its journey around Europe, having already been shown in Italy, Slovakia and Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">I should like to take this opportunity to wish you a very enjoyable and informative experience during your visit to the “Language of Money” exhibition and to once again congratulate the Museum für Kommunikation in Berlin on this valuable initiative.</span>
