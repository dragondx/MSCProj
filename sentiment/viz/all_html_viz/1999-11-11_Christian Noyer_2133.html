    <span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)"> Globally liberalised capital markets and the conduct of monetary policy Introductory statement by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the Fifth International Financial and Economic Forum: "Impact of globally liberalised capital markets", organised by IFW in Vienna 11 November 1999 Introduction Globalisation - understood as the internationalisation of political, social and economic affairs - affects both policy-making as well as our daily lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The idea that we live in a "global village" is perhaps suggested by the fact that on our satellite television we can immediately watch events which are unfolding in very distant places.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Or perhaps it is a subtler feeling gradually coming into our minds while we fill in an e-mail order to buy a new book listed in a far-off country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">However, there is ample evidence that the world we live in is not yet the fully globally integrated system often portrayed in economics textbooks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.22,0)">For example, the prices of tradable goods in different countries expressed in a common currency sometimes converge to a common level rather slowly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.96,0)">Asset portfolios tend to exhibit "home bias".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Thus, in a fundamental sense, it seems that there is "some" globalisation yet to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Nevertheless, the internationalisation of markets, in particular those in the financial sphere, has important implications for the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.43,0)">As international investors thoroughly scrutinise national economic and political developments, unexpected changes in the latter, or "news", may trigger the reassessment of investment strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.71,0)">These, in turn, may have an impact on exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.6,0)">Against this background it is understandable that it sometimes appears more convenient to blame "foreign speculators" or "global markets" for all kinds of economic and social problems, rather than acknowledge their domestic origin, which quite often lies in unsustainable domestic economic policies and a lack of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.33,0)">Of course, it goes without saying that financial markets can also be wrong in their assessment of the fundamental determinants of asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.21,0)">International investors can sometimes be influenced by fads and self-fulfilling beliefs which drive prices away from their fundamental determinants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Asset price "bubbles" can emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.66,0)">However, it is very difficult for policy-makers to identify such misalignments and bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.09,0)">Moreover, increased volatility of financial markets and perceived misalignments are often related to fundamental factors such as policy failures and to a lack of transparency and clarity in policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In the remainder of my presentation I shall focus on monetary policy-making in a global market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.27,0)">The subject is naturally too vast to be fully covered in my introductory statement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Thus, I shall focus my attention on two issues which I think are relevant to our discussion today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">First, I shall mention some of the consequences of globalisation for policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Second, I shall explain why I think that the monetary policy strategy of the European Central Bank is well designed to face the challenges stemming from globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Some consequences of globalisation for policy-makers With regard to the first issue, let me emphasise that I do not believe that globalisation has eliminated policy-makers' influence over domestic political, social and economic developments, particularly in larger industrialised countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">On the contrary, the fact that people and capital can move more freely and quickly across borders makes the consequences of national policy decisions for the respective economies much more immediate and visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.37,0)">Obviously, this makes national policy-making and its presentation to the public more demanding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.64,0)">Naturally, there is a disciplinary effect which comes from globalisation but this does not necessarily run counter to the national interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.48,0)">The influence of domestic policy-makers can be used for good or evil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Globalisation improves the incentives for national politicians to implement good policies, such as structural reforms, which increase the flexibility of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This is demanded by the Treaty establishing the European Community, which requires Member States and the ESCB to "act in accordance with the principles of an open-market economy with free competition".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">These policies will contribute to improved growth and employment perspectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I believe in the idea that all nations gain from trade, including trade in financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Notwithstanding possible imperfections in the financial markets, international capital market integration can yield considerable benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">However, it is important to stress that without flexible markets, countries will not be able to reap the full benefits of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Moreover, it is well known that national authorities would face an impossible task if they had to reconcile in a sustained manner the objectives of what has been called the "inconsistent quartet" of   free trade,   complete international capital mobility,   fixed or managed exchange rates and   national autonomy in the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.08,0)">The painful lesson to be learned from economic theory and historical experience is that these four elements cannot co-exist, and that at least one will have to give way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This is of course one of the major insights which Robert Mundell, this year's Nobel prize winner, taught us more than 30 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.21,0)">Globalisation also implies that certain types of policy measures become less effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.34,0)">This refers in particular to all regulations which can easily be circumvented by the private sector by redirecting business activities to foreign countries or by transferring funds abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The Eurosystem took this into account in elaborating its operational framework, which was set up in line with the market principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.9,0)">For example, there is no facility which explicitly or implicitly subsidises counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Moreover, the remuneration of reserve requirements eliminates the danger that domestic residents will hold deposits outside the euro area in order to avoid the costs related to non-remuneration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem and globalisation As regards the conduct of monetary policy, I think that, in particular in large economies, central banks continue to be able to influence liquidity conditions and thus short-term market rates, irrespective of globalisation and of whether the currency is widely used outside the currency area concerned  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Monetary policy - by adjusting short-term interest rates - will therefore still be in a position to maintain price stability in the respective currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.4,0)">However, globalisation sometimes makes it more difficult to analyse monetary policy indicators and to investigate and understand the transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">An important precondition for monetary policy to remain effective in a globalised environment is a high degree of credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.22,0)">If international markets lose confidence in monetary policy, the negative implications for the domestic economy are likely to be significantly larger in an environment of closely integrated financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">The need to remain credible in a globalised market requires a convincing strategy and transparent communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">In this respect the Eurosystem is well equipped, as I shall now explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The primary objective of the Eurosystem is to maintain price stability in the euro area, as laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">To fulfil its mandate, the Governing Council of the European Central Bank has adopted a monetary policy strategy which is neither conventional monetary targeting, nor direct inflation targeting, nor a simple mixture of the two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Rather the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy is new, reflecting the unique circumstances surrounding the birth of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">The adoption of the single monetary policy by 11 European countries marked a significant shift of regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.53,0)">Under these circumstances, the uncertainty facing the Eurosystem in respect of the indicator properties of monetary, financial and other economic variables for future price developments, and with regard to the reaction of the private sector to monetary policy measures, is greater than has typically been the case in national contexts in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Against this background, the Eurosystem explicitly eschews placing reliance solely on a single indicator or intermediate target for the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The strategy aims to identify those economic disturbances which threaten price stability and to prompt a monetary policy response which is appropriate for maintaining price stability taking into account both the prevailing economic circumstances and the nature of the threat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Given that the Eurosystem's strategy has been designed in this way, globalisation and the uncertainties and changes which it implies will not impair the ability of the Eurosystem to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The Eurosystem's monetary policy is based on a clear framework which is able to cope with the possible impact of external developments on the economic situation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">In particular, one of the strengths of this strategy is that it allows for all relevant indicators to be taken into account over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">By assigning overriding priority to the maintenance of price stability, the Eurosystem seeks to avoid adding to uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">In a global market, this orientation provides the world with an invaluable public good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">However, focusing on domestic price stability will necessitate flexibility in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This flexibility includes exchange rate flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As indicated by Mundell's famous quartet, if three of the four conditions are fulfilled - free trade, international capital mobility and an independent domestic monetary policy focusing on the maintenance of price stability - it is not possible to maintain fixed exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.06,0)">There is widespread agreement that inflation in the medium to long term is a monetary phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The relationship between money and prices is one of the more strongly stylised facts in economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">There are good reasons to believe that this relationship will remain robust in the face of structural changes and globalisation, as it proved to be in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In its monetary policy strategy the Eurosystem therefore gives a prominent role to money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This is signalled by the announcement of a reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">M3 includes a wide spectrum of conventional bank deposits, as well as close substitutes for these, such as marketable short-term bank liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Consequently, it is less likely to be affected by portfolio shifts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.14,0)">When devising its strategy, the Eurosystem took into account the fact that the relationship between money and prices might be affected, in the short term, by the structural changes and behavioural and statistical uncertainties linked to the shift of regime associated with the move to Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.43,0)">Therefore, the concept of a reference value does not mean that the Eurosystem will change its policy stance or react in a mechanical way to deviations of M3 growth from the reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">A careful analysis of the reasons behind monetary developments must always be carried out before drawing policy conclusions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The prominent role for money implies that monetary developments are thoroughly assessed for the information which they provide with regard to the outlook for price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Monetary policy will react in such a way as to address the threats to price stability revealed by this analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In parallel with the analysis of monetary developments, a broadly based assessment of a wide range of economic indicators, including foreign and international developments, will help to inform the Governing Council of the specific nature of the macroeconomic environment and the disturbances to the economy on which monetary policy decisions normally depend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.03,0)">A reliance on a single indicator variable or intermediate target would not prompt the appropriate response in all circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">This is all the more true in view of the increasing role of external developments resulting from globalisation and financial market spillovers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The euro exchange rate plays an important role as it can have an impact on consumer prices, both directly via import prices and indirectly via exports and real activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">However, the strategy eschews mechanistic reactions to exchange rate movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">The emergence of the euro as an international currency with the concomitant reduction in the number of key players in international monetary relations requires an intensified exchange of information on international monetary issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.49,0)">However, it should be recognised that international monetary policy co-ordination such as exchange rate targeting or the co-ordination of the "global policy-mix" could jeopardise the goal of price stability and endanger the credibility of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.09,0)">It could also risk decreasing accountability and reducing transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.15,0)">This would clearly be very undesirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It seems plausible that in the future further countries will consider anchoring, or decide to anchor, their currency either formally or informally to the euro or to a basket of currencies in which the euro would be a major component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Given the prospects of EU enlargement, visible changes are likely to take place in this area in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The sustainability of pegs to the euro will require that these countries have a sound banking system, follow credible and sound monetary and fiscal policies and enhance, through structural reforms, the flexibility of their product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Normally, the closer the exchange rate link, the more important it is that these pre-conditions should be fulfilled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is particularly the case for currency boards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">We are convinced that maintaining price stability in the euro area in a way which is credible, irrespective of the role that the euro plays in third countries, is the best contribution which the monetary policy of the Eurosystem can make to favourable developments in the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.75,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude by saying that globalisation makes the assessment of the economic environment a more intricate task and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy more uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">There will be an increased risk of exposure to the spillover effects of economic and financial disturbances, which will necessitate closer analysis of economic developments from a world-wide perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">However, we are convinced that we have a monetary policy strategy which is designed in such a way that it can be adapted to varying situations and the new challenges arising from globalisation.</span>
