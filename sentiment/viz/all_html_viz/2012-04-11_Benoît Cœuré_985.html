    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)"> Financing the economy of the euro area: the ECB’s role Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,Association Française des Tresoriers d’Entreprises  ,Paris, 11 April 2012 Ladies and gentlemen,   It is a pleasure for me to be here at the Association Française des Trésoriers d’Entreprise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The topic I have chosen for my address today is the role that the ECB has played – and will play – in ensuring that the real economy of the euro area continues to receive the funding it needs to function properly and how this is linked to the ultimate objective of maintaining price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">I will focus in particular on the latest round of non-standard measures – the three-year refinancing operations which were conducted in December and February.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.41,0)">I will start by describing the risks that the euro area economy was facing in the last quarter of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.17,0)">At that time the banking system had funding difficulties, and we were on the brink of a credit crunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.92,0)">If a crunch had occurred, it could have had devastating consequences for many firms and households; their access to financing would have been restricted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">I will then describe how the injection of long-term liquidity has helped to avoid a sudden curtailment of financing to the private sector by alleviating funding pressures on the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I will go on to consider some of the challenges the Eurosystem is likely to face in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.0,0)">Credit developments to households, non-financial corporations and small and medium-sized enterprises   During the last quarter of 2011, monetary and credit developments to the private sector were exceptionally weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.19,0)">The annual growth rate of monetary aggregates declined significantly in December, and it was mirrored by similar developments in lending to the private sector, especially loans to households and non-financial corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.76,0)">Clearly, as the sovereign crisis intensified it impeded banks’ support for the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.18,0)">The annual growth rate of banks’ credit to the private sector decreased in the last quarter of 2011, reflecting monthly negative outflows and reaching troughs comparable with those prevailing in 2008-2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.49,0)">In particular, the rate of growth of loans to households declined, reflecting both demand-side factors   and supply-side factors    .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Incidentally, these developments masked significant cross-country heterogeneity, as some countries saw an increase in flows supported by government measures aimed at the housing market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.44,0)">The annual growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations declined as well, reflecting particularly weak quarterly flows  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">There was considerable cross-country heterogeneity in this case too, with net redemptions taking place mainly in certain countries and loans to non-financial corporations continuing to grow in others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.21,0)">The worrisome picture of monetary developments was confirmed by the results of the Bank Lending Survey for the fourth quarter of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.68,0)">Euro area banks tightened credit standards compared with the previous quarter for both loans to non-financial corporations and loans to households, and to a lesser extent for loans for consumer credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Furthermore, survey participants expected a further tightening of credit standards in the first quarter of 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Even if the tightening was slower than during the 2007-2008 financial turmoil, it was starting from considerably tighter credit standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.73,0)">Although it is always tricky to disentangle supply-side from demand-side factors, banks explained their changes in credit standards mainly by primarily referring to increased funding costs and balance sheet constraints, which were compounded by a rapidly deteriorating economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.73,0)">The funding situation of euro area credit institutions worsened noticeably in the second half of 2011, as shown by the rise in withdrawals of deposits held by non-euro area residents with euro area banks and difficulties in issuing longer-term debt securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.59,0)">This caused banks to make greater recourse to Eurosystem operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.53,0)">The decline in credit to the private sector was accompanied by an increasing reluctance on the part of the euro area private sector to invest in financial assets; it severely hampered banks’ access to financing via the secured money market, due to an increase in haircuts and a deterioration of the available collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.52,0)">While market-based funding was becoming ever scarcer for banks in the euro area  , banks were also facing regulatory and market pressures to strengthen their capital position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.06,0)">In short, back in December 2011, even though there was significant cross-country heterogeneity, the overall picture was rather gloomy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.46,0)">There were clear signs that supply-side factors were making banks less willing to lend to the non-financial private sector, and that banks may have entered a vicious circle which could compromise their ability to supply credit to the economy, both in the short and the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.2,0)">The additional negative impact on banks’ balance sheets of rapidly declining sovereign bond prices made the situation even worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.76,0)">Banks typically have three ways to adjust to pressures on their funding and capital positions: they can sell assets, raise capital or reduce lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let’s look at each of these options in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.74,0)">In an environment of extreme uncertainty and high risk aversion, risky assets can only be disposed of at very low prices, possibly considerably below their book value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.15,0)">Fire sales would weigh on profits, further deteriorating banks’ capital positions, generating in the process negative externalities and sub-optimal collective behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.23,0)">Therefore, to be successful, significant reductions on the assets side of the banks’ balance sheet require a stabilisation of the economic and financial environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.41,0)">Raising capital is also challenging in an unstable environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.5,0)">Uncertainty about the pricing of the risky assets and the overall risk surrounding the valuation of banks makes it particularly difficult to attract new equity investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.2,0)">Raising capital in such circumstances may not be accepted by shareholders as it may send a negative signal to the markets and lead to a drop in share prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.65,0)">And, compared to 2008-2009, credible government support for banks’ capital positions was less available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.88,0)">This left banks with the third option, namely, to reduce lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.7,0)">Banks could easily stop rolling over their loans or granting new ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.98,0)">This strategy, however, while optimal from an individual bank’s perspective, would lead, if pursued collectively, to a credit crunch, with significant negative consequences on the real economy and additional strains on the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.1,0)">A credit crunch would have been particularly dangerous for small and medium-sized enterprises  , given their heavy reliance on bank funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It is no exaggeration to say that SMEs form the backbone of Europe’s economy, accounting for approximately two-thirds of employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me give you a few statistics: SMEs constitute about 99% of all firms in the euro area, employ 72% of the euro area’s labour force and generate around 60% of value added.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.29,0)">They have significantly higher gross job creation   rates than large enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.39,0)">At the same time, SMEs tend to face more stringent financial constraints, have a higher cost of external finance and exhibit higher debt levels than large firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.39,0)">According to the most recent survey on SMEs conducted by the Eurosystem, in the second and third quarter of 2011 access to finance remained one of their most pressing problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.05,0)">To put things into perspective, bear in mind that the number of firms concerned about financing was actually lower in 2009, a period when economic activity in the euro area was very weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">According to the survey, bank financing   remained the most important source of external financing for SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.14,0)">In addition, 20% of the respondents perceived a further decline in banks’ willingness to provide loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.86,0)">Therefore, after the improvement registered in 2010, SMEs were experiencing once again significant constraints in obtaining financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.72,0)">In the light of this evidence, the concrete risk that the increasing pressures on banks’ funding and capital positions could lead to a significant curtailment of banks’ lending activity in some countries was judged to be extremely high in December 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.83,0)">In particular, a dangerous loop involving low economic activity, funding stress for banks and a reduction in lending had increased the downside risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It was therefore a top priority to break this loop before it spiralled out of control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Launch of new non-standard measures and their impact Faced with this critical situation, the Eurosystem adopted a two-pronged strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">First, it offered ample liquidity at very long maturity to prevent funding issues from igniting a potentially destructive deleveraging process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Second, it widened the eligible collateral to facilitate access to the liquidity and the provision of credit to SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Specifically, on 8 December 2011, the ECB announced the following initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">First, the ECB said it would launch two longer-term refinancing operations   with a maturity of 36 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The LTROs were to be conducted as fixed-rate tender procedures with full allotment, with the interest rate fixed at the average rate of the main refinancing operations over the life of the respective operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">To increase the flexibility of the operations and to cater for different liquidity needs, counterparties were offered the option to repay after one year any part of the allotted amounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Second, the ECB decided to increase collateral availability by allowing national central banks, among other things, to accept as collateral additional performing credit claims   that satisfy specific eligibility criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As an example, the Banque de France has accepted real estate residential loans with a mortgage or first-rank privilege, credit claims denominated in US dollars and export credit claims guaranteed by Coface.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Also, in addition to the ABSs that were already eligible for Eurosystem operations, the ECB would accept as eligible collateral ABSs with a second best rating at issuance and over the lifetime of A- or above, the underlying assets of which comprise residential mortgages and loans to SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Additional credit claims not complying with the regular minimum credit quality threshold applied to collateral eligible for Eurosystem credit operations are subject to increased haircuts to aim at achieving risk equivalence with the regular set of eligible collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The Eurosystem allotted €489 billion with the first three-year LTRO on 21 December 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Accounting for other operations that matured and settled within that week, however, the net liquidity increase was €210 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">In the second three-year LTRO, on 29 February, the Eurosystem provided credit institutions with an additional gross amount of €530 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Again, taking into account maturing operations, the net liquidity injection was around €311 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Counterparties bidding in the three-year LTROs can be divided into two groups: one group consists of many small banks, bidding for comparatively small amounts, while the other group comprises large banks and accounts for the main share of the overall allotment amount.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">A distinctive feature of the second operation was the higher number of bidders, 800, as opposed to 523 in the first operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The majority of bidders in the second LTRO were small banks from euro area countries where the economic conditions are stronger, with more than half of the bidders bidding for €50 million or less.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">A reasonable interpretation of this outcome is that the Eurosystem has also been successful in reaching smaller financial entities, which had more time to prepare their bids in the second operation than in the first, and which are essential for providing credit to SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Analysis of the main determinants of banks’ bidding behaviour, combined with anecdotal information provided by banks, confirms that the funding issues I referred to earlier were of vital importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">As an illustration, Slide 3 shows a positive relationship between spreads on bank bonds at issuance and the amounts bid by banks in both three-year LTROs as a percentage of their total assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">The slide suggests that, for those banks with access to longer-term funds in the bond market, there was a strong correlation between their cost of funding and their bidding behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Banks without outstanding debt securities bid on average even more aggressively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.28,0)">Overall, our internal analysis shows that the most aggressive bidders were characterised by larger amounts of debt maturing in the next three years and a shorter average maturity of the outstanding debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.7,0)">The results of the Bank Lending Survey further reinforce this interpretation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This evidence supports the Governing Council’s view that banks were facing significant funding problems and that, by removing impediments to their ability to finance the real economy, the three-year LTROs helped to avoid a dangerous credit crunch in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.95,0)">The large injection of liquidity via the three-year LTROs had an immediate impact on many market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">By reducing concerns over the liquidity situation faced by banks and by cutting banking sector systemic risk  , the LTROs contributed to reopening funding markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In money markets, the EURIBOR-OIS spreads have reversed their widening trend from last year, by narrowing substantially, thereby suggesting that the operations have successfully lowered risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.16,0)">More generally, the whole euro money market curve has flattened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.2,0)">In the secured segment, repo rates in selected euro area government bonds, which had been progressively increasing since August 2011 compared with those based on collateral from AAA countries, declined and continued to remain low, indicating that the funding of Italian and Spanish government bond positions in the repo market has become much cheaper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Although turnover in the repo market has remained relatively subdued, there are signs of a moderate pick-up in the volume in Spanish and Italian markets from their levels at the end of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The widespread perception of lower liquidity risk and improved capital adequacy thanks to the European Banking Authority capital exercise also brought a welcome reduction in US dollar funding costs via the FX swap market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">US prime money market funds increased their exposure to euro area banks in January 2012 for the first time since April 2011, with an additional increase of 21% between the end of January and mid-March, and exceeding 12% of total assets under management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Euro area banks’ issuance of medium and long-term debt picked up in the first two months of 2012 compared with the subdued levels in the second half of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In this period, euro area banks issued about €50 billion in senior unsecured debt, which is about as much as was issued in the entire second half of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Banks also issued €35 billion in covered bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">While term debt issuance was mostly concentrated in some AAA euro area countries in the early phase of market reopening, the issuer base broadened thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">In particular, February saw the issuance of senior unsecured debt by some large banks from Italy and Spain, as well as some increased covered bond issuance by large banks and new issuance by “second-tier” lenders from these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.12,0)">In another sign of improving funding conditions, the cost of medium and long-term funding has decreased since December 2011, as illustrated by the drop in European debt yields for financial and non-financial corporations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Unsurprisingly, the change in yields was particularly pronounced for the lower-rated bonds, confirming that the LTROs have managed to sharply reduce risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The resulting perception that liquidity risks for euro area banks have diminished and that capital adequacy has improved thanks to the capital exercise might also have contributed to the recent strong performance of the stock markets of many euro area countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Euro area sovereign bond markets have rebounded dramatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.72,0)">Yields of shorter-term notes and bills have declined, with two-year government bond yields of Italy, Ireland and Portugal declining by over 400 bps since 8 December 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.84,0)">Longer-term government yields have declined as well, although not to the same extent as shorter-term yields  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The positive secondary market developments were accompanied by favourable primary market activity with sustained demand in auctions of T-bills and shorter bonds in several euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">All in all, there is now strong preliminary evidence that the three-year LTROs have helped the banks to reduce liquidity risk and therefore allowed them to smooth the deleveraging process over a longer period of time and maintain exposures to SMEs – at least in some cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Anecdotal evidence also points to the return of some institutional money market investors, with quite a number of banks reporting that funds   are becoming available again at somewhat longer maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">While banks seem to have used the funds obtained from the first three-year LTRO mainly for refinancing purposes, when looking forward to the next six months, they now seem to expect a stronger use of these funds for granting loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Whether these expectations will materialise remains an open question and the Governing Council will closely monitor these developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.45,0)">Challenges ahead A side effect of the three-year LTROs is that the banking system in the euro area is now in a situation of abundant excess liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">“Excess liquidity”   currently stands at around €800 billion and is expected to remain at roughly this level at least until the end of January 2013, when banks will be able to exercise the option of early repayment on the first three-year LTRO.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.42,0)">The leeway for a reduction in outstanding refinancing operations before that date currently amounts to around €100 billion, and the scale on which banks will exercise early repayment options is difficult to anticipate at the current juncture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">As a consequence, the balance sheet of the Eurosystem has grown to €3 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.07,0)">This large increase is a symptom of malfunctioning money markets and reflects the fact that the Eurosystem has replaced much interbank activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">When the situation stabilises and money markets go back to functioning normally, the balance sheet of the Eurosystem will also go back to its normal size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">To this respect, the Eurosystem is often compared with other major central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.85,0)">Such comparisons however disregard the initial size of balance sheets, as the Eurosystem holds a large volume of assets that have nothing to do with monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.44,0)">In early March, the ratio of monetary policy instruments to regional GDP was 15% for the Eurosystem, 19% for the Federal Reserve System and 21% for the Bank of England.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.21,0)">This large amount of excess liquidity has drawn criticism of two different kinds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.07,0)">Some observers have argued that since banks are re-depositing with the ECB large amounts of liquidity, the injected liquidity is not circulating within the system and therefore the ECB’s actions will be ineffective in preventing deflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.75,0)">Others, however, have warned that since these large amounts of excess reserves may remain in the system for a relatively long time, if they are not appropriately absorbed they will hamper the ECB’s ability to keep inflationary pressures in check.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.92,0)">These fears are of course contradictory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In order to dispel them, let’s look more closely at the channels of transmission through which the excess liquidity circulates in the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.63,0)">The first criticism – that large-scale use of the deposit facility demonstrates the ineffectiveness of ECB’s measures – reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the functioning of the operational framework of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.92,0)">By an accounting identity, any amount of liquidity injected in excess of the liquidity needs of the banking system will be necessarily re-absorbed via the deposit facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The increase in the deposit facility does not provide any information whatsoever about how banks use the funds borrowed from the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For instance, a bank which has borrowed from the ECB can use the funds to grant a mortgage to a client, who in turn uses that credit to pay construction workers, who in turn may buy a car, and so on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.12,0)">After each transaction, the buyer transfers the amount from his or her bank account to the seller’s bank account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The liquidity can circulate many times before eventually appearing on the balance sheet of a bank with a liquidity surplus, which will be deposited back with the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.87,0)">Of course, at the other extreme is the bank which borrows from the ECB and immediately deposits the amount with the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.04,0)">In this case, the liquidity did not circulate at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.11,0)">In both cases, the amount deposited with the ECB would be exactly the same and it is therefore wrong to assume from the large use of the deposit facility that the liquidity is not circulating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In fact, we know that the banks which are depositing with us are not the same as those which are borrowing, indicating that the liquidity is somehow circulating within the banking system before coming back to us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We have no information however   about the speed at which this liquidity is circulating, and through which channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.34,0)">Let me turn now to the second criticism – namely that excess liquidity will generate inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">It is important to recall, first, that the three-year LTROs have helped avoid a disorderly deleveraging which may have led to deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.86,0)">Let’s analyse now the arguments behind the fear that the LTROs may have, however, increased the upside risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Central bank reserves represent one of the many assets in the balance sheet of a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.28,0)">Up to a certain amount, banks’ demand for central bank reserves is completely inelastic  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">Beyond this amount, however, the decision to hold excess reserves responds to risk-return considerations as for any other asset: if a bank decides to hold a certain amount of excess reserves, it is because their risk-adjusted return dominates that of other assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.27,0)">As I mentioned earlier, while an individual bank can decide to hold less excess reserves, in the short run the banking system as a whole cannot dispose of excess reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Since, in equilibrium, supply must equal demand, if interest rates on central bank deposits   are at levels such that demand for reserves exceeds supply, banks will be willing to hold on to the excess reserves present in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.54,0)">This is likely to be the case in a situation of high risk aversion, where – like today – the risk premia demanded to hold risky assets are so high that their risk-adjusted return is lower than that offered by the deposit rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.3,0)">If, however, banks become more willing to accept risks, their demand for excess reserves for a given deposit rate will decrease and they will look for more attractive alternative uses for these funds: riskier assets and/or loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.75,0)">Since the banking system as whole cannot return to equilibrium  , this behaviour will put pressure on asset prices and   on consumer prices as well, unless an appropriate monetary policy stance is taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.85,0)">These effects and the speed at which they may materialise are difficult to quantify as cases of protracted periods of excess liquidity have been rare in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.35,0)">The experience of Japan does not suggest direct effects on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.44,0)">In the United Sates and United Kingdom, there is also no clear-cut evidence so far of a pick-up in monetary and credit aggregates spurred by excess liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.54,0)">However, it is fair to say that in case of a sustained and more robust recovery in economic activity, excess reserves may have a potential macroeconomic impact by allowing a build-up of significant asset price misalignments, or by distorting the banks’ incentive to supply funding to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.62,0)">Moreover, in the face of asset market fragmentation, such asset price misalignments are more likely to build up in countries where banks have ample liquidity positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.13,0)">There is nothing, however, in this reasoning that prevents the ECB from tackling these effects by increasing policy rates, whenever the Governing Council deems it necessary to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Our operational framework makes it possible to steer a whole range of money market rates in line with the desired monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.0,0)">In fact, if the ECB decides to the change its key policy rates, or even hints at it, the indexation of the interest rate charged on our refinancing operations will immediately affect present and future funding conditions for banks, favouring inter alia the exit of some of the LTRO bidders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Furthermore, in our corridor system, the deposit rate puts an effective floor under short-term unsecured money market interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.11,0)">Higher interest rates will reduce demand for loans, as the net present value of the project of the marginal investor becomes negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.79,0)">Higher interest rates will also decrease the demand for risky assets, as the remuneration of risk-free assets increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Eventually, for sufficiently high interest rates, inflationary pressures will subside and the system will return to equilibrium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.36,0)">It can still be argued that there is significant uncertainty as to how an environment of abundant excess liquidity affects the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.95,0)">In particular, heterogeneity in the economic conditions of euro area countries may be magnified by the excess liquidity, which tends to flow to countries where the economic conditions are stronger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.4,0)">However, should this uncertainty weaken our ability to maintain price stability, the ECB has the necessary instruments to absorb the excess liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">In this respect, it is worth recalling that we have been sterilising the liquidity created with the government bond purchases under the Securities Markets Programme for almost two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">By auctioning weekly fixed-term deposits, the ECB has been successfully absorbing substantial amounts of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">In addition, the ECB has the right to issue debt certificates, and, if necessary, we could also decide to increase banks’ reserve requirements again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Reverting to the 2% reserve requirement ratio that prevailed until December 2011 would reduce excess reserves by approximately 100 billion euros.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">So, we are well equipped to cope with any issues arising from excess liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.2,0)">There is a third concern which I would like to touch upon, and which I consider to be a serious one: the risk of moral hazard behaviour triggered by the non-standard measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.27,0)">The large liquidity injections have avoided so far a disorderly deleveraging of the banking sector in the euro area as well as a dangerous credit crunch, but they have not removed the underlying causes of the turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.02,0)">If governments and banks would stop or slow down their consolidation efforts and structural reforms, this would undermine the positive effects of the liquidity operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Following the signs of improvement in the financial environment, it is therefore essential for banks to strengthen their resilience further, even by retaining earnings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The soundness of banks’ balance sheets will be a key factor in facilitating an appropriate provision of credit to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.39,0)">Very low interest rates and ample liquidity conditions may be disincentives for banks to avoid recognising the loss by rolling over loans extended to borrowers who are unable to pay back the principal  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">It is critical that banks readily exploit the current relatively favourable conditions to meet capital adequacy objectives and improve their funding profile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Similarly, to promote sustainable growth and to support confidence and competitiveness, governments need to continue their efforts towards restoring sound fiscal positions and improving competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Many governments have already made significant steps and the efforts must continue unabated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.97,0)">Finally, a fourth concern relates to the risk of persistent market fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The ECB has used conventional and non-conventional measures to restore the transmission channels of monetary policy and make sure that the impulse stemming from it is transmitted more uniformly across the 17 economies of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.94,0)">The large size of the Eurosystem’s refinancing operations and the resulting expansion in its balance sheet are a reflection of the impairments which still hamper the proper functioning of capital markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Today, it is of utmost importance to address these impairments, otherwise we will loose the benefits of the freedom of capital movements which was why monetary union was needed in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.23,0)">There will be no lasting recovery of growth if European households and corporations cannot tap a common pool of savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">To operate smoothly, be more resilient to crises and better support long-term growth, Economic and Monetary Union has to become a true financial union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I will list here some of the key features of the much-needed “Financial Compact”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Repairing the single market for capital is a collective endeavour in which the ECB has a role to play – but to be fully effective that role needs to be coordinated with the European Commission, European Supervisory Authorities and market participants themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Breaking the feedback loop between bank and sovereign credit should also be a priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">To this effect, steps should be taken towards a unified regime for bank resolution and beyond that, towards establishing a single European banking resolution authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Finally, the “Financial Compact” should also include the completion of the single euro payment area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.06,0)">Payments are at the very heart of a corporate’s activity and I am not sure that they always get the attention they deserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Nowadays, more than 50% of the trade of the 27 EU countries takes place within the EU – and that trade is mainly based on cashless payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">With the introduction of the single currency there could no longer be any differentiation between national and cross-border euro payments: they should all be “domestic”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The Single Euro Payments Area project, in short “SEPA”, came to fill this void; its aim is to establish a single market for retail cashless euro payments by overcoming technical, legal and market barriers, so that people can make euro payments throughout Europe as easily, securely and efficiently as within their own countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Using the SEPA payment instruments, companies can make all euro-denominated payments centrally, from a single account, using the same format.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This opens up the possibility of consolidated payments, of liquidity management in one location and of optimising the cash flow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The European Commission has stepped in with the Payment Services Directive which, among other changes, ensures that the full amount of a transaction is transmitted and that payments are executed more quickly, thus saving time and money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">As the transition to SEPA had to speed up, the European Council adopted in February 2012 a new regulation establishing 1 February 2014 as the deadline for the migration to SEPA of credit transfers and direct debits made in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.68,0)">This means that users, including corporates, need to migrate too!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">SEPA is also about innovation; the project is active in innovative fields such as e-invoicing and e-reconciliation within Europe, which can offer huge savings for corporates in the handling of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The ECB, in its role as a co-chair of the SEPA Council together with the European Commission, stands ready to pursue a dialogue with all stakeholders on these important matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Conclusion Let me to bring my remarks today to a conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.62,0)">In the last quarter of 2011 the euro area economy was facing increasing cross-countries heterogeneities and, overall, a clear risk of a credit crunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.5,0)">The increasing pressures on banks’ funding and capital positions could have led to a scaling-back of banks’ lending activity to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.86,0)">The result could have been a vicious cycle involving low economic activity, increased funding stress for banks and a further reduction in lending, eventually leading to significant downside risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The actions of the ECB have helped to break this cycle and to bring confidence back into the euro area financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.6,0)">The large amount of liquidity now present in the system is a consequence of these actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.83,0)">It represents the symptoms of a malfunctioning interbank market, which, if left untreated, could have led to a credit squeeze.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The ECB’s ability to maintain price stability remains intact: we will have the possibility to adjust the interest rates and, if necessary, we have at our disposal a range of tools to actively absorb the excess liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.59,0)">The ECB has addressed the immediate symptoms, but monetary policy cannot cure the underlying causes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.78,0)">The situation in financial markets has reached a turning point but recent market developments have highlighted that it remains fragile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">All the relevant players must act responsibly by taking the necessary steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Banks need to meet capital adequacy objectives, improve their funding profile, and start lending again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Governments must build on the steps already taken to restore sound fiscal positions and support long term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">At the ECB we will continue to closely monitor further developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">We will do whatever it takes to fulfil our mandate of delivering price stability over the medium term for the 330 million people of the euro area.</span>
