    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)"> Economic and Monetary Union: past and present Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Europa-Konferenz organised by Hertie School of Governance, Jacques Delors Institute and Bertelsmann Foundation, Berlin, 19 September 2018 It is vital today that we move the debate on European integration forward, and conferences such as this are key forums to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Fostering open and frank discussion about our common future is critical for knowledge to grow and for consensus to emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It is precisely through vision, rigorous analysis and frank discussion that Jacques Delors was able to overcome the economic challenges of his time, and what he described as the “fundamental differences of opinion” and “mental reservations”   which characterised the political climate back then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.59,0)">Today, we also face economic challenges and political disputes about the future of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">So it is useful to look back at the evolution of European integration in the 1980s and distil the lessons that can be learned from it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The strategy that Delors, Kohl, Mitterand, Andreotti and other EU leaders developed relied on three elements: first, unlocking the potential of European integration by focusing it on common challenges where the EU could clearly help; second, recognising that integration in one area creates an interdependence with other areas; and third, equipping the EU with the tools and institutions to manage that interdependence and ensure stability and convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">These three elements should also guide us today in designing and implementing the necessary reforms to Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.08,0)">The single market agenda The European economy in the mid-1980s was just emerging out of a turbulent decade of recession and weak economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Unemployment in the European Community had continually risen from 5.8% in 1980 to 11.2% in 1985.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.38,0)">Europe’s potential growth rate had dropped from about 5% per year in the 1970s, to around 2% per year in the following decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.22,0)">The international environment was also becoming less accommodating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">America’s defence, foreign and economic policy was fastly changing under the leadership of newly-elected President Reagan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Trade disputes had emerged across the Atlantic and the share of American imports covered by trade restrictions moved from 8% in 1975 to 21% by 1984.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.74,0)">Trust in forging a deeper European project was low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In the early 1980s, just one out of four people expressed an interest in European affairs and only around half of Europeans saw their country’s membership of the EU as “a good thing”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.14,0)">The integration process was at a standstill and “Europe seemed to lack faith in itself”, as Delors argued at the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">European leaders of the day understood, however, that low growth was in fact a common challenge, and the EU had a powerful tool at its disposal to address it: the common market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">They also perceived that any further opening of trade should be accompanied by measures that would ensure its fairness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.34,0)">Intra-EU trade growth had stalled since the early 1970s, in large part because the common market covered mainly intermediate goods where growth potential was already saturated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Converting the common market into a single market, however, could open up trade in sectors with high R&D and skill-content and reinvigorate productivity spillovers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Establishing a single market meant removing both tariff and non-tariff barriers, such as differences in licensing rules and technical standards, which restricted trade and capital flows across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And it meant setting common rules to be enforced by a single competition authority, so that all parties in the market were treated fairly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But for the single market to be sustainable over time, opening markets and enforcing rules was not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Interdependence with other policy areas had to be taken into account, and the EU had to be equipped with the necessary tools and institutions to ensure stability and convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">First, for safeguarding the integrity of the single market, neither fixed nor flexible exchange rates were seen as a sustainable option in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.61,0)">Under flexible exchange rates, countries losing market share could engage in competitive devaluations, which would encourage retaliatory actions from others and would undermine trust among Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.58,0)">And fixed exchange rate regimes were proven to be vulnerable, as demonstrated by the ERM crisis that transpired a few years later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">So economic and financial integration needed to be accompanied by a commensurate step forward in monetary integration – one market with one money – which culminated in the decision to create the euro and the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.51,0)">Second, it was well understood that opening markets could sometimes penalise local producers, as well as creating conglomeration effects where industries migrate to the most competitive regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.12,0)">That could lead to an unequal distribution of the benefits of integration, which needed to be offset by instruments to ensure fairness and convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">An integral part of the Single Market was therefore the establishment of mechanisms at the European level to cater for these needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Stronger competition enforcement was matched by stronger protections for local producers, such as extending geographical indication protections for specific foods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">And there was both an increase in the size of the EU budget and a major rebalancing of expenditure away from agriculture and towards convergence and cohesion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Specifically, targeted funds were provided to promote adjustment in regions that were less developed or suffering from the effects of trade liberalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">By 1992, the budgetary allocation for structural funds rose from 17% of EU expenditure to more than 25%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Taken as a whole, this was a far-reaching and visionary strategy, and one that took tremendous political courage to bring about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">And by and large, it worked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">By 1988, two years after the Single European Act was launched, growth in intra-EU trade had already regained its level of the early 1970s, and by 1990 the EU’s potential GDP growth rate had risen by a percentage point to 3% per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Thanks to economic integration, estimates suggest that after ten years of EU membership, a country’s per capita income is on average 10% higher than if it had stayed outside the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">As a result, the single market has become increasingly popular: free movement of goods, people and services is routinely seen by the public as one of the most positive results of the EU, next to peace among Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This remains the case today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The lesson is clear: when Europe focuses on common challenges, when it recognises interdependence, and when it responds with appropriate institutions, it does succeed – and when integration is not accompanied by fairness, it does not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.04,0)">The areas where EMU has underperformed most in recent decades are those that were left unfinished in the 1980s and 90s, such as the frameworks for fiscal policies and for banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.19,0)">Delors was deeply concerned that the institutions for fiscal policy coordination were too weak for a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Others saw early on that a single currency would need a system of common banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.9,0)">We know that these holes in the framework ultimately contributed to the build-up of imbalances and played a role in the euro area crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.34,0)">But it was not the single market and the single currency that produced this situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.0,0)">It was the failure to follow through in all areas with the formula that had worked in those areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The role of Europe today The challenges we face in Europe today are in many ways similar to those of Delors’ era.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.68,0)">We are also exiting a deep recession that has left lasting scars on the economy and society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.6,0)">The international environment is characterised by rising uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.12,0)">And some are questioning whether European integration remains the answer to our common problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.83,0)">Potential growth has been slowing with respect to other advanced economies and is projected to remain weak for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.18,0)">Just as in the 1980s, many of our challenges have this weak growth performance at their root.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.59,0)">Low growth exacerbates pressures on public finances; it aggravates joblessness especially among the young and unskilled; it heightens distributional questions about open markets; and it creates a false perception among the public that protectionism is a solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">So can Europe again provide the keys to change our growth trajectory?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The answer is yes – but only if we transfer in full the strategy that worked in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">That is, a clear focus on the areas where Europe can add value, and a rigorous attention to consistency across policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The most important area where Europe can contribute positively to growth remains the single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.96,0)">Most euro area countries have ageing societies, which means that raising living standards will increasingly depend on higher productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.26,0)">Productivity growth, however, has been stalling in the euro area for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The single market represents one of the most powerful tools we have to unlock the mechanisms that will raise productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Productivity growth takes place through two channels, innovation and diffusion of new technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">We have innovative firms in Europe and they compare well with their international peers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.59,0)">But innovations do not diffuse quickly enough to other firms, which weighs on productivity in the wider economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">The top 10% of firms are on average three times more productive than the firms in the bottom 10%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.12,0)">And the sector where the gap is the widest is services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In this context, advancing the single market agenda can help in two ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">First, research shows that openness to trade is a key factor in enabling faster technology diffusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Completing the single market in services can therefore boost productivity by raising trade in services, which should be higher in a fully integrated market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.96,0)">Services make up over 70% of EU GDP, but only 20% of services are traded across borders, representing just 5% of EU GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The second element is building a true single market in capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Deep financial markets play a critical role in facilitating diffusion, by providing the risk capital for firms to commercialise new technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">But the opportunities of our large financial market are not being exploited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.57,0)">In the euro area, only around 30% of debt securities and 20% of equities are held by investors in other countries, and only around 10% of the assets of the banking sector are held by branches and subsidiaries of cross-border banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Completing banking union and capital markets union are the critical measures to improve this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Taken together, the gains from this agenda would be sizeable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">According to one estimate, removing all barriers to trade could raise the EU’s income by up to 14% over ten years and double intra-EU trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.93,0)">This underscores why, especially for countries struggling with low productivity , reversing the direction of European integration would not be a profitable path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Moreover, in an international environment where trade openness can no longer be taken for granted, a broad and deep internal market may become even more important to shield us from external shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Completing the single market would also provide a further benefit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Integrated markets, and especially financial markets, help share risks within and across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Such private risk-sharing plays a vital role in adjustment in well-functioning monetary unions, because individual regions cannot adjust to shocks through exchange rate devaluation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This takes place through two main channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The first is integrated capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.51,0)">Typically, a recession causes both consumption and asset prices in a region to fall, which then reinforces the downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">But when people can diversify their asset holdings across different regions, they can smooth their consumption by drawing on the assets they hold in better performing parts of the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The second channel is an integrated banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.8,0)">Because local banks are typically heavily exposed to the local economy, a downturn will lead to large losses and prompt them to cut lending to all sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">But if there are cross-border banks that operate in the region, they can offset losses there with gains in other regions, and can continue providing credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In the US, it is estimated that around 70% of local shocks are absorbed through integrated financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the euro area, however, only 25% of shocks are absorbed in this way because financial integration is low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.19,0)">As I have explained elsewhere , this is one reason why our crisis was so protracted and why some countries diverged economically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Risk-sharing, in other words, fosters both stability and convergence within monetary unions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.81,0)">And without that, it becomes much harder to make high rates of growth sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">So, to boost growth and increase private risk-sharing, our priority should be as follows: to re-establish a clear focus on finishing the single market in all its dimensions; and consistent with the strategy that Delors laid out, to buttress this with appropriate tools and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Today, this buttressing applies most of all to closing the gaps that remain in the institutional architecture of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">There are two key areas where actions are necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Buttressing the Monetary Union First, we need to address the obstacles that are still standing in the way of deeper financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">We have already taken important strides in this direction with the creation of European banking supervision, a harmonised rulebook and the Single Resolution Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.92,0)">There has also been considerable risk reduction in the banking sector, with bank capital rising, leverage falling and non-performing loans being progressively reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But there is still work to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">This includes finishing the clean up of bank balance sheets, as legacy assets act as a deterrent to cross-border takeovers, and especially removing the remaining supervisory and regulatory barriers that hamper cross-border activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.46,0)">For example, despite the banking union, regulation still limits the free flow of capital and liquidity within cross-border banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.03,0)">This in turn reduces the efficiency gains for banks of operating on a European scale, and keeps retail banking integration low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.17,0)">Yet levelling the playing field alone is not sufficient for deep financial integration – and this is the second point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.15,0)">Today’s debate is often cast in terms of dichotomies: private risk-sharing versus public risk-sharing, and risk sharing versus risk reduction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But I believe that, to a great extent, these different goals are complements, not substitutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.7,0)">Take the example of restrictions on the free flow of liquidity and capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.46,0)">These barriers exist in part because there is an incomplete framework for bank resolution in the euro area with no public backstop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.04,0)">If there is a residual risk that the costs of bank resolution will end up on one single government’s balance sheet, those national authorities will have the incentive to limit capital and liquidity flows, so as to protect their depositors in the event of a bank failing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.98,0)">With common public risk-sharing through a backstop for the resolution fund, the incentives at the national level to limit capital and liquidity flows would disappear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">That would in turn lead to greater banking integration and private risk-sharing at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Risk-sharing, however, would not be a way to avoid risk reduction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">When markets have confidence that banks can be resolved efficiently, it stabilises the system and reduces the costs of crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In other words, risk sharing actually reduces risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.62,0)">A good example of this is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in the US, which is also the resolution authority, and is backstopped by a credit line with the US Treasury.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.12,0)">During the crisis, it resolved around 500 banks without triggering financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">This was possible because of confidence that the resolution framework was effective and that was backed by the resources it needed to do the job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The same interaction also applies to fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.94,0)">We saw during the crisis how lack of fiscal space, needed to stabilise the economy, can create a vicious circle of low growth, rising bond spreads and loan-losses in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.56,0)">That can in turn produce financial fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.52,0)">For as long this risk exists, it is obvious that it will deter deep financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.74,0)">And it also means that private risk-sharing tends to collapse at precisely the moment it is most needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">To address this, the first priority is to make national fiscal policies more effective by encouraging governments to build up buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">For that, we need to rekindle faith in our fiscal rules by making them both more countercyclical and more binding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But we know that even sound domestic policies are not always enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.89,0)">Markets can at times overreact and penalise sovereigns, over and above what may be needed to restore a sustainable fiscal path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.04,0)">And this overshooting can harm growth and ultimately worsen fiscal sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This is why there is also a role for public risk-sharing, although the more we complete banking union and capital markets union, the smaller this needs to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.52,0)">The European Stability Mechanism cannot fully fill the gap, as it typically leads to procyclical fiscal tightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">So, we need an additional fiscal instrument to provide stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">There ought to be an instrument that complements monetary policy in delivering macroeconomic stability both at the euro area level and, crucially, in each of its Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As I have discussed elsewhere , what shape this fiscal instrument should take is still open for discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But any proposal should fulfil the following two conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">First, it should be adequate, so that it can restore full fiscal stabilisation capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">And second, it should be properly designed so as to contain moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">With these conditions in place, such an instrument should be seen as a way of reducing risks rather than increasing them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.76,0)">This is a difficult time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And difficult times provide lessons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Rather than criticising our opponents’ views, or offering simple solutions to complex questions that are invariably wrong, let’s try to understand what these lessons are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The example of the founding fathers of our monetary union offers invaluable help in this endeavour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We should not be discouraged that there is still work to do to complete our Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">No union is built perfectly from day one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">It is an evolutionary process that is well described by the commitment to build “a more perfect union” enshrined in the US constitution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">History suggests that this evolution tends to follow people’s priorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In the 1980s, the overriding goal was to shake off the “Eurosclerosis” that stalked Europe at the time and growth became the top priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Today’s priorities include personal and economic security; addressing youth unemployment; and strengthening social models so as to care better for the sick, old and unemployed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">How could these objectives be achieved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Today, like thirty years ago, the answer lies in the restoration of growth and in the respect of our common European values.</span><span
