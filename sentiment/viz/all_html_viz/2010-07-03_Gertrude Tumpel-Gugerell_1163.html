    <h3> Speaker: Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)"> The ECB’s actions during the recent crisis and the policy elements needed for a sound recovery Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB at the Conference on “How can the EU and China Contribute to a Sound and Sustainable Global Economic Recovery?” at the Shanghai ExpoShanghai,3 July 2010 Ladies and Gentlemen, I am greatly honoured to speak here today at the World Expo 2010 in Shanghai, the first one in China.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Two days ago I had the chance to visit the Expo myself and I am truly fascinated by the window to the world and its perfect organisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I am told that the emblem of the Expo is inspired by the Chinese character for “world”, and that there is a popular saying in China, which goes: “The world is wonderful, if you don’t see it, you don’t know”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">I think this saying describes not only the atmosphere at the Shanghai Expo quite well, but also China’s general attitude towards today’s globalised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">And one could turn it around and say: “If you have not seen China, you can not imagine how wonderful it is” – and I have no doubt that it will one day become a major global financial centre as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.81,0)">The financial crisis has hit the global economy and has led to losses of income and costs to the system around the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Today, we are focusing on how the EU and China can contribute to a sound and sustainable global economic recovery, which is in the interest of all of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">We are here to discuss the policies needed to address the financial instabilities that we were faced with and we need to discuss the policies that will steer our economies back to a sustainable long term growth path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Let me give you my key message in this regard right up front: I believe that the recovery in Europe is well on track and that we have the right policies in place to ensure the return to the levels of growth we have seen prior to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">In my speech today, I will take the opportunity to discuss how the European Central Bank   has responded to the adverse effects of the financial crisis since 2007 and how this has not only prevented worse outcomes but has also contributed in the current environment to setting the stage for a sound recovery in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Indeed, also on the basis of low interest rates all along the money market yield curve, providing attractive financing conditions, the economy is expanding and we see a positive growth outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">I will also outline which policies – in my view – are needed for the recovery to be sustainable with the prospect of long term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">First, structural reform policies to strengthen overall growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Second, a financial market sector reform  , Third, fiscal consolidation   and fourth, the continuous concentration of monetary policy to be directed at medium term price stability as this is the necessary and crucial contribution of monetary policy to fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Price stability and financial stability are indispensable elements shaping the outlook for global growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">A third element is sound public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But before addressing these issues, let me give you some ideas on what the ECB has done during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.03,0)">The ECB’s actions during the crisis Recent years have been most challenging across the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.57,0)">What started as tensions in the money market in August 2007 quickly spread around the globe, leading to severe repercussions across economies and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.66,0)">After the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, we saw a sharp fall in global activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.09,0)">In the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009, global trade volumes fell by 18 percent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.79,0)">This development was also felt here in China, where year-on-year GDP growth decelerated to 6.2% in the first quarter of 2009 from 9.1% in the third quarter of 2008 and trade values decreased by 33% from September 2008 to March 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.74,0)">In the euro area, real GDP fell by altogether almost 4.5 percent and unemployment rose by 1.4 percentage points in just six months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.12,0)">At the same time, extra-euro area export volumes of goods decreased by 18.0% and import volumes by 12.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The ECB acted quickly and decisively in response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.91,0)">We reduced our key interest rates to unprecedented low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.19,0)">The interest rate at the main refinancing operations was lowered by 325 basis points to 1.0% between October 2008 and May 2009, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">within a period of only seven months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.41,0)">And, we have left it unchanged since then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">In addition, we introduced a series of non-standard measures to support credit provision by banks to the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Our non-standard measures were designed to sustain financing conditions and credit flows above and beyond what could be achieved through reductions in key ECB interest rates alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">These measures, which we refer to as “enhanced credit support”, included essentially five elements: We lengthened the maximum maturity of refinancing operations, we extended the eligible collateral list, we provided liquidity in foreign currencies, we initiated a covered bond purchase programme, and, above all, we provided unlimited liquidity in all refinancing operations at a fixed rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The enhanced credit support led to a considerable improvement in market liquidity and helped to alleviate funding risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.12,0)">As a result of our actions, money market interest rates, money market spreads and interest rates on bank loans declined significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.31,0)">In early May of this year, we were confronted with renewed market tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.5,0)">These tensions arose in some segments of the euro area debt securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.39,0)">Again, after carefully considering the situation, we decided to act, since the tensions were hampering the monetary policy transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">We launched the Securities Markets Programme to ensure depth and liquidity in those market segments which are dysfunctional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The objective of this programme is to address the malfunctioning of securities markets and to ensure the proper transmission of monetary policy impulses to the wider economy and, ultimately, to the general price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Overall, all the non-standard measures we have taken have been consistent with our mandate to deliver price stability for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.6,0)">From the very beginning, we have made clear that those measures are, by construction, temporary in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">In fact, the Governing Council remains firmly committed to its price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">This is credible for financial market participants and the public, as reflected in inflation expectations that are firmly anchored at levels in line with the aim of the ECB’s Governing Council to keep inflation rates below, but close to 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Elements needed for a sound economic recovery The ECB measures were indispensable to support the functioning of the euro area banking sector and to prevent worse outcomes during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">But with our contribution to attractive financing conditions and the smooth functioning of money and credit markets, the ECB has also contributed to bringing the euro area economy on the recovery track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Indeed, the economic recovery in the euro area is well on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">After a period of sharp decline, euro area economic activity has been expanding since mid-2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Business and consumer confidence indicators have been trending upwards over the last quarters and the June 2010 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections – but also those of other organizations - see a further rebound in GDP growth to take place in 2010 and 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">This notwithstanding and taking a longer term perspective, I believe that more is needed for this recovery to be solid, sustainable and long lasting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">So let me outline which policies – in my view – are needed to achieve good prospects of long term growth with at the same time ensuring both, price stability and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In the following, I will mention four policy elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">First, the strengthening of growth prospects through structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Second, fiscal consolidation aiming at sustainable fiscal positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Third, monetary policy geared towards price stability and finally a comprehensive reform of the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">First, strengthening growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Structural reforms leading to higher growth and employment are crucial to support a sustainable recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">We know very well that structural reforms pay off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.05,0)">For instance, measures which increase competition in the consumer markets can curtail monopoly rents and lead to higher employment and output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.7,0)">The introduction of the Single Market, for instance, has – according to estimates of decreased monopoly rents by a quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Studies have also found that this may have increased potential output in the range of 5 - 10 percent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Also labour market reforms, such as for instance an adjustment of the unemployment benefit replacement ratio by 5 percentage points has been estimated to give rise to 1.5% more output and 1.7% more employment over a period of 5 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Therefore, policies to enhance competition and innovation are needed to speed up restructuring and investment and to create new business opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Increased labour market flexibility, but also investments in education and research are required to create employment opportunities and enhance competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Restructuring of the banking sector, aiming at solid business models, better risk management and increased transparency will be key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">In this respect, the European Commission has recently put forward its Europe 2020 strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The aim of this strategy is to deliver higher levels of employment, productivity and social cohesion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Europe can come out stronger from the crisis, if it seizes this opportunity to implement the reforms that are necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Second, fiscal sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Sound public finances are the basis for an economy to prosper and to develop in a sustainable way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This is particularly important in a monetary union, such as the euro area, where sixteen individual countries have a common monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">A number of euro area governments have adopted fiscal consolidation measures and set out ambitious fiscal targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">On 7 June, the euro area finance ministers agreed on the spring 2010 orientations for fiscal policies in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">We welcome the commitment to take additional measures, where needed, in order to ensure the achievement of the budgetary targets for 2010 and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.78,0)">Will these consolidation efforts have a negative impact on growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.73,0)">In the short run, the effect will very much depend on the economic outlook and to what extent public demand will be replaced by private demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.81,0)">Our current estimates foresee some dampening impact on growth, but not a very significant one, depending on the fiscal instrument that is used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In the long run, however, the benefits of fiscal consolidation prevail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">An illustrative analysis of multi-year fiscal consolidation programmes conducted by our experts which we have published in the July edition of our Monthly Bulletin suggests that the long-term economic gains of restoring sound fiscal positions in the euro area outweigh by far the short-run costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">According to model simulations, long-run benefits of a permanent reduction in the euro area debt-to-GDP ratio over the years from 90% to 60% are generally in the range of 0.4-2.2% of initial steady-state real GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Therefore, cohesive action at a European level is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Each country needs to live up to its responsibilities, and European governments need to work together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">This goes hand in hand with the conclusions of the G20 meeting in Toronto last weekend, where the G20 economies committed to fiscal plans that will at least halve deficits by 2013 and stabilize or reduce government debt-to-GDP ratios by 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This should support a sound, longer-term economic recovery on a global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Third, price stability, which is our primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">As I have mentioned, we have used both standard and non-standard, temporary monetary policy measures during the crisis period to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">We remain firmly committed to price stability over the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">We have done so in the past - with average annual inflation in the euro area over the past 11 years since the inception of the euro of only 1.98% - and we will do so in future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This is also seen by financial market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In particular, inflation expectations in the euro area have remained well-anchored in line with the Governing Council’s definition of price stability, also throughout the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This can be seen in different indicators, for example in the Survey of Professional Forecasters, where inflation five years ahead is continuously expected to stand either at 1.9% or 2.0% since the beginning of 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Thus, the ECB is credible in the delivery of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">This credibility is not only key in the implementation of monetary policy, but it is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy makes to fostering sustainable economic growth, job creation and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Fourth, financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">It is important to step up efforts to ensure financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.01,0)">In many respects, the recent crisis can be seen as the direct result of vulnerabilities and imbalances in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.31,0)">We have all felt the negative effects that the financial crisis had on economies around the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">To build a safer financial system, the responsible authorities need to enhance their financial sector surveillance, both at a micro-prudential and macro-prudential level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Financial institutions also play a decisive role, as they have to improve their risk management practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.54,0)">A key challenge for policy-makers will be to design appropriate responses to enhance the stability of the financial system without imposing restrictions that would unnecessarily hamper financial innovation and reduce the efficiency of the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">At the micro-prudential level, several initiatives are now underway to create more effective supervisory regulation, taking into account the lessons learnt from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The proposals of the Basel Committee – known as “Basel III” – aim at enhancing capital and liquidity regulation to improve loss absorption, mitigate procyclicality and increase the resilience against shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">These measures – when phased in gradually with the economy recovering – contribute to long term economic growth, not least by preventing such high costs of a crisis we are currently experiencing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">If there is one uncontested lesson from the crisis it is that systemic risks were largely underestimated and, therefore, make the development of a comprehensive macroprudential supervision absolutely essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">An effective macro-prudential framework aims at delivering a thorough analysis of systemic risks, as well as the formulation of appropriate policies to address such risks identifying, in a timely fashion, the emergence and build up of critical vulnerabilities, and deciding on effective   intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Central banks have a very important role in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">At the European level, a new body will be set up: the European Systemic Risk Board  , which will be an independent body responsible for conducting macro-prudential oversight of the EU’s financial system as a whole and which will be supported analytically and logistically by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">The ESRB should be seen as a component of a global framework of macro-prudential oversight, also allowing it to contribute to the assessment and containment of global risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">In this sense, systemic risk surveillance and preventing those risks from materializing will be a key contribution to sustainable long term growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The global crisis of the last years has shown that policymakers around the globe have acted successfully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Confidence has come back.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">With our policy actions, we at the ECB have supported credit flows to the economy and thus dampened the negative effects of the crisis to the extent possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Looking ahead, we now need to draw lessons from the crisis and focus on the elements that ensure that the global recovery is sound and sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">For this, I believe four elements are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">These are strengthening growth prospects, fiscal sustainability, price stability and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For price stability and financial stability, central banks play a key role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">They will shape the global recovery by maintaining price stability and safeguarding financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Price stability is the central contribution that monetary policy makes to economic growth, to job creation and to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Financial stability, in turn, will be a major focus of policy-makers in the aftermath of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.52,0)">Central banks have specific tasks and responsibilities in this domain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">For example, the ECB will contribute to the ESRB to conduct macro-prudential oversight at a European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.3,0)">Of course, central banks cannot act alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Actions are required to address all conditions and challenges to spur long term economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We all have to work together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">National governments, regulators and supervisors, and the private sector and financial industry have to proceed with the difficult, but vital, measures required to ensure a sound basis for economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">With China being one of the most important trading partners for the euro area and vice versa, recovery in the euro area and China is in our mutual interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">I am confident that we are on a good track.</span>
