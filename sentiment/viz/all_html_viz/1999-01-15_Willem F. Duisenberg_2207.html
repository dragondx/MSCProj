    <span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)"> European economic and monetary union - latest developments Speech by Willem F. Duisenberg President of the European Central Bank at the Second Asia-Europe Finance Ministers' Meeting on 15 January 1999, Frankfurt am Main, Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">It is a great pleasure for me to welcome you to the European Central Bank  , at a time when the Eurosystem - that is, the ECB and the 11 national central banks   of the Member States which have adopted the euro - has just started to assume responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">After their meeting in 1997 in Bangkok, this is the second time that Asian and European Finance Ministers are coming together with the aim of establishing closer political, economic and financial links between Europe and Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">I very much appreciate this approach, since the process of rapid globalisation, with highly integrated financial markets, calls for strengthened co-operation between the two regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Today, I should like to share some thoughts with you on recent developments surrounding the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">First of all, I should like to comment on the successful changeover to the euro only two weeks ago and its rapid acceptance by financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Second, I shall focus on how we intend to accomplish our primary task of maintaining price stability across the euro area in an internationally challenging environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Finally, I shall turn to the international aspect of Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The successful changeover to the euro Following a period of intense preparatory work and considerable progress in macroeconomic convergence, the third and final stage of EMU started on 1 January 1999 with the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The 11 Member States initially participating in the euro area have transferred their monetary policy sovereignty to the European System of Central Banks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Since 1 January 1999 the Eurosystem has been responsible for determining monetary policy for the entire euro area, which has an overall population of almost 300 million people and a GDP which is roughly equal to that of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The start of the euro has been successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Such a smooth launch of the new currency was not widely expected until the very end of 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In the early afternoon of 31 December 1998, the Council of the European Union adopted the irrevocable conversion rates of the euro against the participating currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">During the following three and a half days, over the so-called changeover weekend, all technical work required to create a single integrated euro area money market was implemented without any major incidents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.84,0)">Under very severe time constraints, the banking and financial community in the euro area and beyond, including the ECB and the national central banks, carried out the complex task of converting billions of electronic records and managing a variety of other logistical challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Large-value payment systems were adjusted to function in the new currency and the bulk of the outstanding public debt of participating countries was redenominated before the first trading day in euro started on 4 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The Eurosystem played a crucial role in this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It was involved in a very large number of activities, including helping to compute and publish the irrevocable conversion rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The ECB co-ordinated the orderly transition to the new currency within the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">It conducted final tests, when required, and it launched the new infrastructure for payments and securities settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">For this purpose, a "Changeover Weekend Committee" and a network of "central communication points" were created to gather and share information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Contacts were established with the central banks of non-participating EU Member States and of the Concertation Group - including the Bank of Japan - as well as the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The decision-making bodies of the ESCB stood ready to gather in extraordinary teleconference meetings, if necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">As regards monetary policy operations, the Eurosytem announced its first main refinancing operation in the form of a fixed rate tender in the amount of E75 billion on 4 January, which was completed successfully on the following day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In the context of this operation, 944 Monetary Financial Institutions bid and, since a fixed rate tender procedure was applied, every institute was allotted a refinancing amount.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">In addition, the Eurosystem began successfully operating the euro area payment system, TARGET, which ensures the smooth settlement of cross-border payments in the euro area and, as such, has contributed substantially to the integration of the euro money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">After some "teething troubles", the financial community in the euro area is adapting to the system and the new euro environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">More than 5,000 credit institutions are currently participating directly in TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">The very rapid acceptance of the new currency by financial market participants in the first two trading weeks following its introduction has further contributed to the credibility of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Such credibility, which already existed prior to the introduction of the euro, helps to explain why the euro area weathered the financial market turmoil relatively well in the second half of 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Propitious starting conditions within the euro area facilitated the task of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">In most of 1998 and at the beginning of 1999, the overall price climate has been very favourable, with neither risks of inflation nor signs of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.48,0)">In addition, long-term interest rates have fallen to new historical lows and the whole yield curve has shifted downward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The single monetary policy in a challenging environment Institutional framework Of course, this favourable environment is facilitating our task of maintaining price stability across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Price stability is at the heart of the "stability culture" that has developed in Europe in the period leading to the adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This culture is not to be seen as an objective in itself but as a major prerequisite for sustainable growth and improved employment prospects in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">To meet the objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area in an effective and credible way, the Treaty establishing the European Community has endowed the Eurosystem with a high degree of independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The counterpart of such independence is accountability and transparency vis-Ã -vis the European Parliament and the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In terms of its institutional framework, the ESCB is based on the concept of a dual-layer central bank system consisting of the ECB and the 15 NCBs of the EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.48,0)">As regards the Eurosystem, its highest decision-making body is the Governing Council of the ECB, which meets every fortnight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.5,0)">It is composed of the six Executive Board members of the ECB and the Governors of the 11 participating NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.9,0)">In addition, the General Council, comprising the members of the Governing Council and the Governors of all the national central banks in the European Union, including the four EU central banks not yet participating in the euro area, meets quarterly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">By virtue of their involvement in the General Council, the four non-participating national central banks are associated with the relevant ESCB decisions, such as those relating to the new exchange rate mechanism ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">With regard to accountability and transparency, the Eurosystem goes beyond the requirements of the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In addition to my yearly appearance before the European Parliament to present the ECB's Annual Report, I shall take part in hearings at the European Parliament four times a year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.54,0)">Since summer 1998, a routine of holding monthly press conferences has been established, in which the Vice-President and I report on the decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB and explain the underlying reasoning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Our introductory statements at these press conferences are published without delay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In addition, the ECB will provide the public with a Monthly Bulletin, the first issue of which will be published next week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Monetary policy strategy Let me now describe how we intend to meet our mandate to maintain price stability at the start of Stage Three of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">At the heart of our approach is our recently adopted and publicly announced "stability-oriented monetary policy strategy".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.12,0)">Since the introduction of the euro implies a regime shift, the formulation of an appropriate monetary policy strategy was a complex exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.34,0)">Breaks in previously established economic relationships are bound to make our interpretation of euro area-wide data more difficult in the initial phase of Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.74,0)">The length of this transition period itself is difficult to ascertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.62,0)">Economic agents may restructure their investment portfolios and adjust their expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.36,0)">The wage formation process may change and entrepreneurs could alter their traditional price-setting behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Bearing this in mind, the Governing Council invested considerable effort in the design of a coherent framework, taking into account the specific circumstances of the shift to the new monetary regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me briefly recall the main features of our monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">First of all, we have defined price stability as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%, which is to be maintained over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">This definition constitutes a clear benchmark against which the public can properly assess the success of the Eurosystem in fulfilling the Treaty's mandate of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.79,0)">It shows that the Eurosystem pursues a symmetric approach to deal with both inflation and deflation, and that the single monetary policy cannot, and should not, react to specific national developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In order to maintain price stability according to this definition, the Eurosystem's monetary policy strategy is based on two pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">First, money is assigned a prominent role, since monetary developments are the determinants of inflation in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Therefore, we have announced a reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate, namely M3, in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">On the basis of our current economic forecasts, a growth rate of 4.5% has been set, which is consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.56,0)">However, the fact that it is a reference value and not a monetary policy target implies that monetary policy will not react in a mechanistic way to short-term deviations from this level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Second, a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and of potential risks to price stability in the euro area also plays a major role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is achieved by making use of a wide range of monetary, financial and economic indicators in the preparation of our monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Monetary policy operational framework On the operational side of monetary policy, the ECB has recently set interest rates for the Eurosystem's monetary policy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Consistent with the key central bank rates prevailing at the end of Stage Two of EMU, after the remarkable co-ordinated interest rate cuts carried out by euro area NCBs in early December last year, the benchmark level for the first main refinancing operation was set at 3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">We announced our intention to maintain this interest rate level for the foreseeable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In addition, the Eurosystem uses standing facilities, namely the deposit facility and the marginal lending facility, to absorb and provide overnight liquidity respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.73,0)">The deposit rate has been set at 2% and the marginal lending rate at 4.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.44,0)">However, as a transitional measure aimed at smoothing the adaptation of market participants during the initial days of Stage Three of EMU, the corridor established by the interest rates for the Eurosystem's standing facilities has been kept narrow, with the deposit rate at 2.75% and the lending rate at 3.25%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.18,0)">Since such a narrow corridor hampers the development of an efficiently functioning euro area money market, we intend to terminate it next week, in accordance with our pre-announced schedule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Economic policy co-operation The ESCB does not operate in a vacuum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.45,0)">If not adequately supported by other policy areas, namely fiscal, labour and structural policies, implemented mainly at the national level, the single monetary policy may become overburdened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Monetary policy needs to be supplemented by appropriate fiscal, labour and structural policies if it is to yield in full its welfare benefits to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">This is a major prerequisite to improve the perspectives for sustainable economic growth and for tackling the unemployment problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">That is why I attach the utmost importance to the so-called Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In this Pact, euro area Member States agreed to reduce their general government deficits to close to balance or even to create a surplus in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This is intended to enable the working of automatic stabilisers over the economic cycle while, simultaneously, respecting the limit of 3% on the public deficit/GDP ratio, as laid down in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.11,0)">As regards labour and structural policies, the single monetary policy cannot solve Europe's unemployment problem by itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Of course, a stability-oriented monetary policy can help to stabilise inflationary expectations and, thereby, hold interest rates at levels consistent with the highest possible non-inflationary growth rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">However, since Europe's unemployment problem is largely structural in origin, only structural reforms improving the flexibility of labour markets and supportive wage policies can provide the appropriate policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The international side of EMU Let me now try to shed some light on the international aspect of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Clearly, the newly designed monetary setting in Europe will have far-reaching implications not only for Europe and its citizens, but also for the world economy and the international community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Although, the introduction of the euro represents a major institutional change in the architecture of the international monetary system, it does not in itself imply a regime shift from the present managed floating exchange rate system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">International aspect of the euro A number of observers consider that one important motivation behind EMU is the creation of a major international role for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.49,0)">This assessment is largely incorrect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.46,0)">The ECB takes a neutral stance with respect to the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">First of all, the euro represents a major contribution to the completion of a fully integrated single market, encouraging competition and innovation at the area-wide level, in an environment of prices which remain stable over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.59,0)">The international role of a currency is a complex phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">A currency can be used for different functions, as an anchor and reserve currency on the official side, and, on the private side, as an invoicing and vehicle currency for international trade, as well as a currency of denomination for financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.68,0)">In addition, there are very different groups of economic agents which decide on the use of the currency, including governments, central banks, institutional and private investors, corporations and traders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">At any rate, it will take time for the euro to develop its role as an international currency in its various functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In principle, two basic factors will determine the future international dimension of the euro - risk and size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Economic agents may use the euro to hedge their risks through portfolio diversification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">If international investors and borrowers consider that the euro will become a stable currency, they will hold euro assets to minimise risk in their internationally diversified portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">With regard to the size factor, a broad and liquid euro financial market may lead to a widespread use of the euro, which, in turn, would facilitate its development as a vehicle currency for trade and commodity pricing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">The euro is likely to develop over time as an international currency used by the private sector, although the pace of internationalisation may vary depending on the function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">As far as the future share of the euro in overall official reserves is concerned, it may be expected that central banks of non-euro area countries will also reassess their reserve management strategy in the light of improved global diversification opportunities offered by the new currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Moreover, the euro might also assume a greater role as an anchor currency for other European countries which, formally or informally, intend to peg their exchange rate to the euro or to a   basket of currencies which includes the euro as a large component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In this context, the euro may increasingly become part of foreign currency reserves held by central banks for diversification or pegging purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">International representation of the Eurosystem Let me turn to the institutional aspect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The euro area is a new counterpart in the context of international co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">By reducing the number of key players, the euro will simplify the international policy co-operation process between the major economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">In particular, it should make this process more efficient by facilitating the exchange of views and formulation of common understandings on economic and financial issues at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Each of the main partners - the United States, the euro area and Japan - is in a position to speak for a comparatively large economic area and is similarly vulnerable to adverse shocks to the international financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">A more balanced relationship between the major players might help to induce each of them to take on responsibility for contributing to a stable global environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In many ways, the ECB as part of the Eurosystem is already represented in international institutions and fora.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Although some decisions are still under consideration, formal and informal agreements have already been reached with the International Monetary Fund  , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  , the Bank for International Settlements   and in the G-7 and G-10 context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Most recently, the IMF has granted observer status to the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The IMF, as the cornerstone of the international financial system, plays a key role in the process of multilateral surveillance of economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Therefore, it is important for the ECB to be represented at the IMF from the outset of Stage Three of EMU, given the respective mandates of both institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Architecture of the international monetary system I should also like to make a few remarks on the renewed interest in the concept of target zones for exchange rates among the main currency blocs, namely the United States, the euro area and Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">In a world characterised by highly integrated and sophisticated international financial markets, there is serious doubt whether target zones for exchange rates are feasible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.13,0)">Apart from the obvious risks of undermining price stability, such exchange rate targets would, in essence, imply that domestic policy objectives would have to be subordinated to external requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.48,0)">This is the reason why the exchange rate is not an explicit aim of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This stance is based on the conviction that the exchange rate of the euro is the outcome, rather than an objective in itself, both of the economic, monetary and other policies pursued in the euro area, and of cyclical developments in the euro area and abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.51,0)">Of course, this does not mean that we shall neglect the exchange rate of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Exchange rate developments are monitored carefully in the context of our broadly based assessment of future price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.57,0)">Moreover, the euro exchange rate plays a far smaller role in the euro area than it played in the individual Member States in the past, which is also a consequence of the fact that the euro area is larger in size and is therefore less dependent on external trade than each individual Member State was before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In line with the Eurosystem's approach to the euro exchange rate, the EU Ministers of Finance, who are ultimately responsible for the exchange rate policy of the euro, agreed in December 1997 to issue "general orientations" only in exceptional circumstances, such as in the case of clear and persistent misalignments of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.51,0)">It seems to me we have not reached that stage.</span>
