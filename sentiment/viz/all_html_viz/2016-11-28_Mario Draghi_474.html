    <span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)"> Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement of Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECON committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 28 November 2016 I am glad to be back at the European Parliament just a week after the plenary debate on the ECB’s activities in 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This will be my last visit this year, so it is a good opportunity to reflect on upcoming challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In 2016 the euro area economy proved to be resilient, in spite of uncertainty stemming from the economic and political environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Inflation has gradually edged up, and the ECB’s monetary stimulus has been a key ingredient of the ongoing recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In my remarks today I will first focus on the upcoming challenges at global and euro area levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Then, at the request of this committee, I will discuss the still uncertain impact of Brexit and its implications from a Single Market perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Strengthening the recovery: responding to current challenges at global and euro area levels The global economy is expected to continue its recovery, although growth will remain slower than before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.54,0)">While showing signs of resilience, the global economy is facing significant political and economic uncertainties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In this context, one of the key takeaways from the 2016 World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings was that monetary policy cannot be the only game in town.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.55,0)">It cannot generate sustainable and balanced growth on its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">To increase the effectiveness of monetary policy, fiscal and structural policies are needed that reinforce growth and make it more inclusive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The euro area economy continues to expand at a moderate but steady pace, despite the adverse effects of global economic and political uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This gradual upward trend is expected to continue, not least owing to our monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In particular, our very low policy interest rates, the favourable lending conditions in our targeted longer-term refinancing operations and our ongoing asset purchases have resulted in lower borrowing costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Firms are benefiting from improved conditions when seeking loans from banks and when issuing equity or new bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Smaller firms are also benefiting, both via lower borrowing costs from banks and from the increased capacity of banks to grant loans, while larger firms are increasingly seeking funding from the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">These conditions support higher consumption and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This is reflected by the gradually improving supply of loans to households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Still – if supported by decisive action taken by other policymakers – monetary policy measures in the euro area could be even more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.29,0)">Low productivity growth, legacy problems in the banking sector and limited progress with structural reforms are all issues that need to be tackled swiftly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This would help close the output gap faster and increase growth potential, resulting in higher employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.53,0)">I am aware that the attention of our policymakers has shifted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In the direct aftermath of the financial crisis the need to complete Economic and Monetary Union came to the forefront of the European debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.93,0)">Since then circumstances have changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Today Europe’s focus is more on security.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Both projects require Europe to be united – to act together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">However, let us not forget that Europe will be better able to protect itself if it has a strong and resilient economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">And for that purpose, Economic and Monetary Union will have to overcome the vulnerabilities stemming from its incompleteness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.89,0)">One important lesson from the crisis is that a half-built house is not stable, it is fragile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Progress is thus needed in all the unions identified in the Five Presidents’ Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">This committee plays an important role in ensuring greater financial sector resilience in the European Union and in completing the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">To this end, solid progress is needed on the current legislative dossiers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The European Parliament will also play a leading role in the context of the proposed revision of the Single Rulebook’s legislative pillars: the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive  , the Capital Requirements Regulation   and the Capital Requirements Directive  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The Single Market and Brexit Let me now turn to the repercussions of Brexit, which you have asked me to address in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">For both the euro area and the United Kingdom, the Single Market has been a fundamental asset and a positive sum game.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Bringing together European economies has allowed the European Union to reap efficiency gains and better satisfy demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">For sectors such as financial services, the ability to serve an EU-wide, interconnected market is a key factor of success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The Single Market also makes it possible for firms to benefit from the complementarities of various locations across the EU as part of European value chains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Moreover, the free movement of people ensures that anyone can seek work where economic activity is concentrated as a result of agglomeration effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Economic clusters in turn benefit from being able to recruit workers from across the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The United Kingdom has benefited from the strong economic and financial links within the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In fact, more than 40% of the foreign value-added contained in UK exports comes from the rest of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Within the Single Market, the United Kingdom has also been a major hub for wholesale banking activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">More specifically, the single passport means that UK-based banks can currently serve the rest of the EU without needing to set up subsidiaries in other Member States, and vice versa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">That implies sizeable savings in terms of capital and liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.43,0)">If, in the long run, the risk of a less open UK economy in terms of trade, migration and foreign direct investment were to materialise, there would be a negative impact on innovation and competition and, thus, productivity and potential output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Such developments would first and foremost weigh on the UK economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">They would to a likely lesser extent also have some limited adverse spillover effects on the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.72,0)">The overall impact would, however, vary across countries depending on their trade links with the United Kingdom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">So far the euro area has weathered the fallout from the referendum outcome with encouraging resilience, also thanks to the preparations of central banks and supervisors on both sides of the Channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The outcome of the vote led to a pronounced bout of heightened risk aversion, but the market reaction was short-lived and asset prices largely recovered in the weeks thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.62,0)">Also, the euro area Economic Sentiment Indicator and the Purchasing Managers’ Index, which declined in August, recovered in September and October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In the United Kingdom, economic activity has also remained fairly resilient on the back of robust consumption growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.01,0)">At the same time, uncertainty appears to have weighed on investment and the pound sterling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.4,0)">Economic activity in the United Kingdom is generally expected to slow down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.41,0)">It is difficult to predict the precise economic implications of the United Kingdom withdrawing from the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.11,0)">They will notably depend on the timing, progress and final outcome of the upcoming negotiations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Thus, it is important to have clarity on the negotiation process as soon as possible in order to reduce uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, let me be clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.3,0)">While the UK referendum did create uncertainty as far as the country’s participation in the Single Market is concerned, the Single Market cannot go backwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is imperative that its integrity and the homogeneity of rules and their enforcement will be preserved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">This also means we cannot take backward steps concerning the regulatory, supervisory and oversight framework for banks and financial market infrastructures, which has been enhanced considerably since 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">It is, in fact, essential to further strengthen and develop the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In the area of financial services we have made significant progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The Single Market for financial services is now supported by the Single Rulebook for banks and by common supervisory institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Within the euro area we went further with the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.73,0)">As I have said, we are not at the end of this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">For instance, financial integration through a fully fledged Capital Markets Union could diversify financing sources for European companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">By fostering private risk-sharing, it can also contribute to a more resilient European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">It is encouraging to see that recent opinion surveys show support for European integration increasing since the UK referendum, contrary to the expectations of many.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">At the same time, there are lessons to be learnt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">The key lesson is that the European Union has to deliver on key objectives from the citizens’ perspective if it is to rekindle trust in the European project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">And to address the widespread feelings of insecurity, including economic insecurity, the European project needs strong economic foundations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">For the euro area economy, this means strengthening the recovery, preserving financial stability and addressing the remaining vulnerabilities of Economic and Monetary Union.</span>
