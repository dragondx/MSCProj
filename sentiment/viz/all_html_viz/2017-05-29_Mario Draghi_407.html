    <span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)"> Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement of Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECON committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 29 May 2017 Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be back speaking to your committee for the second regular hearing of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I am also pleased that you have chosen as the topic for today’s hearing the role of financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is only one element in the broader process of innovation which is taking place in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">But it is a decisive one, given the essential role played by financial markets in resource allocation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Before addressing this topic, let me first review the economic outlook and discuss the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The economic outlook The economic upswing is becoming increasingly solid and continues to broaden across sectors and countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Real GDP in the euro area has expanded for 16 consecutive quarters, growing by 1.7% year-on-year during the first quarter of 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.53,0)">Unemployment has fallen to its lowest level since 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Consumer and business sentiment has risen to a six-year high, supporting expectations of a further strengthening of growth in the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.93,0)">Downside risks to the growth outlook are further diminishing, and some of the tail risks we were facing at the end of last year have receded measurably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The fact that domestic consumption and investment are the main engines driving the recovery makes it more robust and resilient to downside risks, which relate predominantly to global factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Despite a firmer recovery, and looking through the volatile readings in HICP inflation over recent months, underlying inflation pressures have remained subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Domestic cost pressures, notably from wages, are still insufficient to support a durable and self-sustaining convergence of inflation toward our medium-term objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">For domestic price pressures to strengthen, we still need very accommodative financing conditions, which are themselves dependent on a fairly substantial amount of monetary accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">At its June monetary policy meeting the Governing Council will receive an update of the staff projections and a more complete information set on which it will be able to formulate its judgement on the distribution of risks around the most likely outlook for growth and inflation Overall, we remain firmly convinced that an extraordinary amount of monetary policy support, including through our forward guidance, is still necessary for the present level of underutilised resources to be re-absorbed and for inflation to return to and durably stabilise around levels close to 2% within a meaningful medium-term horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">You asked me to discuss with you today the dynamics of long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.6,0)">Over the past few decades long-term bond yields have been trending down in both nominal and real terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.28,0)">While lower nominal rates in part reflect monetary policy among other factors, the decline in real yields has been driven by structural factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.23,0)">These factors include notably rising net savings as ageing populations plan for retirement, relatively less public capital expenditure in a context of high public indebtedness, and a slowdown in productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">If long-term real interest rates are to rise again to sustainably higher levels, it is those underlying causes that need to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">And this requires structural action at national and European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Our monetary policy, for its part, has been instrumental in addressing the cyclical component of the balance between the supply of savings and investment demands, and its price stability implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">By supporting nominal incomes, our monetary policy measures stimulate investment and consumption, which are preconditions for inflation to climb back to levels below, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">And a more dynamic economy, over time, will favour a healthy return to higher policy interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The relevance of financial innovation for the ECB and the euro area The relation between savings and investment leads me to the topic you have chosen for today’s hearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Greater financial efficiency in the euro area is crucial in improving the allocation of capital and ensuring it is put to productive use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Innovation in financial instruments, services and infrastructure, as well as changes in the organisation of financial markets, can play a useful role in that respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Financial innovation is a continuous process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Innovations had constantly arisen in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Past examples of innovation include the introduction of secured debt and of preferred stock, which were developed to align incentives between parties and address information asymmetries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Some innovations of the past were instead introduced to minimise transaction costs and they have become part of our everyday lives, like credit cards or ATMs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Today, fintech – the application of new technologies to banking and financial services – is a potentially transformative force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">We are closely monitoring its development for several reasons: to better understand its impact, to assess the risks and to adjust the regulatory environment and supervisory approaches where needed; and also to adapt as an institution and support innovation where justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me now give you some concrete examples of why fintech is directly relevant to our tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">A deep knowledge of the channels through which monetary policy affects the economy is of crucial importance to us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.04,0)">As fintech, and financial innovation more broadly, have the potential to impact the way the economy is financed, in the future they may affect the transmission mechanism of monetary policy and ultimately financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">As the central bank for the euro area, we thus remain vigilant and make sure that changes in the financial landscape are closely tracked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">As central bank of issue for the euro, the ECB and the Eurosystem also have a statutory interest in the safety and efficiency of payment systems and market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.38,0)">One of the most active fields of fintech innovation which might affect the processing of payments and securities is that of distributed ledger technologies  , such as the blockchain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Given the rapid pace of development in this field, there is a need to constantly monitor and assess potential new or more pronounced risks resulting from the application of new technology such as DLTs to payment, clearing and settlement infrastructures in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.56,0)">One such possible risk is an increase in market fragmentation if different DLT approaches were to become firmly established in parallel in different Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Moreover, the Eurosystem oversight framework has to remain effective if we are to discharge our responsibility in this new environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">And the Eurosystem will of course continue to act in accordance with its mandate to promote the smooth operation of payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Fintech also gives the financial sector, more generally, a chance to provide more efficient and effective services to households and companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Fintech can, for instance, make it easier for banks to adjust their business models, cut costs and exploit new business opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Fintech companies can also complement the lending capacity of banks by acting as an additional channel for accessing credit, for instance through peer-to-peer lending platforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">This may in turn help to reduce the macroeconomic fallout from disruptions in the provision of bank credit to households and firms, including smaller ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">At the same time, the increasing relevance of non-banks and digital innovation in the provision of financial services may also harbour new risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">It is, for instance, essential to assess and adapt the prudential framework to cater for the increased role of non-banks and financial innovation, ensure the existence of a level playing field for both new and existing players and provide supervisors with adequate tools to address new risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">To this end, we are actively involved in ongoing work at both European and international levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Furthermore, risks stemming from the use of new technologies need to be carefully managed, particularly in the context of heightened cybersecurity concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.95,0)">Cyber risk has long been a priority for national and European supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Since day one, the ECB Banking Supervision has also addressed the issue from various angles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">As financial market infrastructure overseer, we also need to ensure that individual systems, as well as the network as a whole, are operationally resilient to cybercrime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">While we are closely monitoring potential risks from fintech, we also contribute to financial innovation by acting as operators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The TARGET2-Securities   platform that went live in June 2015 is now a cornerstone of the capital markets union project and has given a strong impetus to promoting and creating harmonised, integrated and efficient euro payments and securities post-trade services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The ECB is also acting as a catalyst in the creation of a truly single European market for payments and securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Financial integration and financial development are distinct, but interrelated concepts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Therefore, in designing the necessary institutional and regulatory frameworks we need to make sure that financial integration and financial development reinforce each other, thus improving the performance of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is why EU legislators have an important role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">A Europe-wide harmonised and principles-based framework to regulate fintech, in the context of the capital markets union agenda, would indeed help to create a level playing field from the outset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">This would in turn foster cross-border investment and expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">So as you can see, fintech has the potential to improve efficiency in the financial sector, create better products and push prices down for consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But it has other dimensions too, in the shape of potential risks and new regulatory questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is in all our interests to rise to this challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As fintech involves the entire financial sector, different regulatory responses are likely to be needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.58,0)">Depending on the nature of the fintech activity, those responses may need to encompass prudential, consumer protection and other regulation – but, at the same time, they should not hamper healthy developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Conclusions Allow me to conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The euro area economic outlook is improving and downside risks are moderating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">However, these positive signs should not distract from the need for firmer and higher structural economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">In this context higher productivity growth is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">And that productivity growth requires innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Structural reforms are essential to create a business environment that is conducive to innovation and a regulatory environment that adapts accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Both national and European level initiatives can contribute to this effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">If we want to make sure that our Economic and Monetary Union   thrives, we need to upgrade its institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">This means that we should be ready to foster innovation wherever necessary, including in the functioning of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In that spirit, I look forward to the debate that will be opened up by the upcoming European Commission reflection paper on deepening the Economic and Monetary Union.</span>
