    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)"> Europe at the crossroads Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank,Speech at a dinner on the occasion of the Frankfurt European Banking Congress,Frankfurt am Main, 20 November 2003 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to speak to you tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is a special occasion for me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is the first time that I address - as President of the European Central Bank – the European banking community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">As European bankers, you are of great importance for our work at the ECB and – if I may say so – the ECB is of relevance for your work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">It is good to be here tonight with you and it is nice to see many familiar faces and good friends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Thank you very much for the invitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">I am particularly grateful that this dinner takes place so close to my new home, Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Please let me, in the presence of the Mayor, Mrs Petra Roth, express my gratitude and admiration to this city.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As Member of the ECB's Governing Council and previously of the EMI Council, I have been coming to Frankfurt regularly over the last nine years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">By and by this city has become dear to me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">It is a pleasure to see to what extent Frankfurt accommodates its banking community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The city provides us with the amenities and attractions of a truly modern and international life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">"Identify Europe" is the title of the congress that provides the occasion for our dinner tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.57,0)">It is a title which reminds me of essays that I had to write at school, such as "Characterise the Renaissance" or "Explain the Rise of the Roman Empire".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">"Identify Europe" comes as an imperative – almost an order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It urges us to define what Europe is about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There are, of course, many ways of approaching this question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We can define Europe geographically, culturally, historically or economically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Please allow me to reflect upon the issue from an institutional perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As President of the European Central Bank, I will interpret the term Europe as the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Thus, I will take the title of the congress as an encouragement to discuss the EU's main characteristics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I think it is the right time to reflect upon the key features of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Europe stands at the crossroads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">It needs to take the right decisions now in order to maintain its major qualities in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.92,0)">What are the main tasks facing the EU?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">First, the Union needs to give itself an institutional foundation – a solid Constitution - that makes the EU fit for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Second, the Union has to integrate an unprecedented number of new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In my speech, I will concentrate on these two tasks and discuss to what extent – from the perspective of a central banker - the EU is on the right track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I will, however, start by identifying what I regard as the three key qualities of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Three key qualities of the European Union The European Union is a remarkable endeavour which is absolutely unique in human history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Three reasons are, most of the time, proposed for explaining this collective will of the Europeans to unite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.78,0)">First, the lessons drawn from the wars, particularly the last two world wars, which were, from a European standpoint, abominable civil wars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.77,0)">Second, after World War II the emergence of the Soviet Union empire creating a major economic, social and strategic threat for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">And third, the challenge of global economic competition which called upon the setting up of a large single market to benefit from economies of scale of the same order of magnitude as those existing in the US single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Ensure peace amongst the Europeans, protect Europe against external threats, permit Europe to cope efficiently with global competition had undoubtedly played a role in the bold European adventure of the last half century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.43,0)">But I am not sure that they are really telling the full story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In a way all these reasons are defensive, aiming at protecting Europe against domestic and external dangers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I trust that at the heart of the European ideal of today there are also ideas that are profoundly enshrined in the European psyché: the idea of universality which is topical in the "Enlightenment", in der "Aufklärung", dans les "Lumières".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">In this perspective, European Union "in motion" would be also driven by this profound and rich European dedication to universality which is at the root of our civilisation and the ultimate goal of the Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I am referring to fertile ideas of ancient times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.23,0)">But as Jean Monnet said in his "Mémoires": "There is no such thing as premature ideas, there are only ripe times that one should wait for."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Whatever the complex set of reasons, almost fifty years ago European nation states took a bold step: they decided to work together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">They initiated a European project which over time transformed this continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">I have always seen the European Union as an impressive sailing ship with strong masts and many sails.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">This sailing ship and its crew have three very important qualities: clear objectives, willingness to co-operate, and openness to "newcomers".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">From the beginning, Europe has been set on a clear course and sailed with a clear mission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This is to achieve prosperity, peace, and stability for the citizens of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Member States work together as a team.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">They are willing to pool their specific abilities and national sovereignties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">In a co-operative manner - unparalleled to any international organisation – they overcome differences and manage diversity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">They share the conviction that they should find European solutions to European problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The Eurosystem is a perfect example for the co-operative approach that characterises the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Europe has always been open for new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Membership is neither limited nor exclusive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Clear rules and procedures pave the way for newcomers to join the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Overtime, the ship has grown in size and quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">New members joined and new competencies were acquired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In the nineties, the ship was given an important additional mast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This new mast is Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Its strong sails push the ship further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">They reinforce the strength of the EU and generate stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In the coming months, this ship will be restructured considerably and will expand its crew significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.27,0)">It is doing this at sea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The day-to-day work of the EU continues; there is no break or pause that allows for practices or trial runs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The key challenge is to accomplish these tasks while keeping the three qualities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">These qualities are worth maintaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">They have made the EU to what it is today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me now concentrate on the first task, the Constitution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.16,0)">The Constitution The EU has diverted from its traditional path of recurring Treaty reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">It has decided to give itself a Constitution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Those of you who come from Central and Eastern European countries will be familiar with a process of adopting a constitution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In your countries the new constitutions have laid the foundation for an open society and democratic institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.37,0)">In the case of the EU, the new Constitution does not signify the start of a new political era.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.31,0)">Why then has the EU embarked on a constitutional process?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Speaking as an outside observer to the process, it seems to me that the Constitution is to serve two purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The first purpose is renovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The EU has to be made fit for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">It needs well-functioning decision-making procedures and effective institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">This is not only in view of enlargement but also in order to adapt to new international demands and changing economic circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.35,0)">The second purpose is clarification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.52,0)">While concentrating on improving the strength and the size of the EU, accessibility and clarity might have been neglected over the years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The Constitution shall put this back in order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">It seeks to make the EU and its decision-making process more transparent and comprehensible for the citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">So, Europe is given itself a new Constitution to consolidate existing achievements; to codify key objectives and common values; and to provide a stable and effective foundation for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The EU has embarked on a special method for drafting the new Constitution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As you know, over the last one and a half years representatives from national and European institutions discussed in the Convention what Europe's new Constitution should look like.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">The ECB has followed these debates with great interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">It welcomes the draft Constitution as presented by the Convention in June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">However, as central bankers, we had to learn a new lesson.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">For the first time since the setting up of the ERM in 1979, a major reform of the EU takes place without monetary integration being in the limelight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The reason is simple: as far as monetary integration is concerned the EU has reached a "sustainable endpoint".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The Maastricht Treaty gave the EU a modern "monetary constitution" which does not need be changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It is sound both in terms of the objectives set and the allocation of responsibilities between different actors and levels of government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The Convention rightly recognised this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Its draft Constitution takes over the provisions relating to EMU without changes in substance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.79,0)">The single monetary policy is, by its very nature, indivisible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Thus, it is an exclusive competence of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The task of conducting monetary policy, as well as all other central banking tasks, has been assigned to an independent European Central Bank, which fulfils the task together with the National Central Banks of the euro area and with the clear primary objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The draft Constitution explicitly mentions the European System of Central Banks, the ESCB, in the first part of the Constitution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Thus, it acknowledges the federal nature of the monetary authority of the European Union and its sui generis character.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Finally, the more specific provisions concerning monetary policy in the current Treaty as well as the Statute of the ECB and the ESCB will in their substance remain unchanged and form part of the constitutional texts of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">I very much welcome that the fundamental features of the current set-up of EMU have been preserved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">After all, the stability of the institutional architecture is a crucial element of the credibility of the single monetary policy and the public's confidence in our currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Of course, further refinements to the draft Constitution are possible, and the ECB has made several suggestions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">For example, we strongly believe that price stability should be added to the list of the Union's objectives set out in the first part of the Constitution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Because Price stability is of great importance not only for the ECB but for the Union as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It ensures confidence in the long-term value of the euro and translates into low and stable medium and long-term market interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.63,0)">It also avoids an abitrary redistribution of wealth, thus it helps to protect the weakest members of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Price stability certainly deserves to be an objective of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Furthermore, we would like to see a clarification of the allocation of responsibilities concerning the international representation of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It would also be useful to recognise the widely used term "Eurosystem".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Naturally, in all our comments the ECB does respect the prerogative of national governments and ultimately the citizens to adopt the institutional framework of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">At the same time, the ECB has a clear interest for the constitutional process to be a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">In this, I completely concur with what my predecessor, Wim Duisenberg, repeatedly stressed: for a well-functioning monetary union a strong and effective EU is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.17,0)">EMU contributes significantly to the strength of the EU but without a political Union and effective institutions the ship will lose balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.01,0)">Therefore, I would like to comment briefly on provisions in the draft Constitution that concern the overall political institutions and procedures of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">I think, it is to be welcomed that the draft Constitution increases the visibility and continuity of the key representatives of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">A new elected President of the European Council and a strong EU Foreign Minister will help to put faces to decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">I also support the extension of qualified majority voting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The EU may not necessarily acquire new competencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">However, the EU should have the means to implement effectively those competencies that have been given to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Qualified majority voting ensures that decisions are actually taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It is now for the Intergovernmental Conference to use the Convention's draft for finalising the Constitution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In this regard, I look forward to listen to the discussions at the first panel of tomorrow's congress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Enlargement The upcoming enlargement of the European Union is without any doubt a major achievement and a challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The ten new members will almost double the number of current Member States and the EU population will increase to more than 450 million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Looking beyond these numbers, the largest ever expansion of the Union will be a historic landmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">It will underline the end of decades of division and reunite the European continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Enlargement will also bring benefits in a more narrow economic sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Both new and current Member States alike will be able to enjoy the benefits deriving from the expanded internal market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Both the current and new Member States have been preparing intensively for enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me first focus on the situation in the acceding countries and then on the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">I will finally concentrate on a specific aspect of enlargement, which is of particular relevance for central bankers – namely the extension of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Acceding countries have made remarkable progress in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">They significantly furthered macroeconomic stabilisation and structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Moreover, those acceding countries that were formerly centrally planned economies have been able to establish functioning market economies, thus pursuing the process of transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">There remain, however, formidable challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">The task at hand is to advance real convergence while safeguarding and, where necessary, enhancing macroeconomic and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">In particular, locking in inflation at low levels, preserving the soundness of the financial sector and renewing efforts towards fiscal consolidation are all of the utmost importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.94,0)">The gap in per capita income between the current and the new Member States remains large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.14,0)">The process of catching-up in real incomes has been slower than many expected at the start of transition, although the progress achieved differs somewhat across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.82,0)">For acceding countries as a whole, per capita income today is less than half of the average of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Given the very low starting point for most countries, increasing prosperity and living standards will remain their main policy objective for quite some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Of course, accession to the EU is expected to have a positive effect on the countries' prospects of convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The full integration into the internal market will increase growth prospects and thus foster the catching-up process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">New Member States will have to complete the adoption and, even more importantly, implement the acquis communautaire  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Turning now to the current Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">The EU has also been preparing intensively to make enlargement work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Member States took steps in the Treaty of Nice to streamline their decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">As I already mentioned, the ongoing process of giving the EU a constitution is also linked, at least in part, to enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Within the realm of central banking, the Eurosystem has been engaged since 1999 in a constructive dialogue with the central banks of accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The institutional structures of the ESCB are also being adapted and Governors of the central banks of acceding countries already take part as observers in the General Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Finally, and most visibly perhaps, the ECB has submitted a recommendation on the voting modalities of its Governing Council, which has been accepted by the EU Council and is now under ratification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">This will allow the ECB to maintain the efficiency and timeliness of decision-making in an enlarged euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In fact, enlargement of the EU will lead to the extension of the euro area some time in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">New Member States enter with a commitment to strive towards the adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Let me stress that the basic interest of the euro area in this process is to ensure that the monetary integration of the new Member States proceeds in a smooth manner and in line with Treaty provisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This has two important implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">First, given the heterogeneity among acceding countries in their economic structure and their exchange rate regimes, no single path towards the euro can be recommended to all acceding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">At the current juncture, the ECB does not discourage any particular strategy, provided it is based on sound economic reasoning, conforms to the existing institutional framework and contributes to the high level of nominal and real - namely sustainable – convergence, which is of the essence when joining the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Secondly, the principle of equal treatment will continue to apply throughout the entire process of monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Adopting the euro is an extremely serious affair and it is of the utmost importance that countries fulfil the convergence criteria in a sustainable manner before adoption of the euro, as stated by the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There will be no additional criteria but there will be no relaxation of the criteria, either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.28,0)">No more, no less.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Returning to the theme of identifying Europe, enlargement exemplifies the inclusive nature of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The newcomers join the Union on the basis of a rules-based process and as equal members of the team.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Moreover, enlargement will advance the EU's objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">It contributes to prosperity, stability and peace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Finally, the many preparations for enlargement, both by the EU and by the acceding countries, provide a vivid illustration of the willingness among Member States to implement European solutions to European issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, The European Union can be proud of its qualities, its clear objectives, its willingness to co-operate and its openness to "newcomers".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">I am optimistic that despite the profound tasks that lay ahead the EU will maintain these qualities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Europe will sail on with a strengthened crew and a modernised ship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Yet, we all have to play a constructive role in this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">There are investments to be made for rebuilding the new Member States and there are financial services to be integrated into one European market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">I sincerely believe that Monetary Union contributes to accomplishing these tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">The euro has become a strong symbol of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">It makes the world "identify Europe" and helps Europeans to identify with Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">I am grateful that as new President of the European Central Bank I have the opportunity to ensure that the euro will continue to stand for a successful Europe.</span>
