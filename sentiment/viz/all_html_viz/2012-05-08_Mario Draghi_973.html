    <span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)"> Address at the event marking the first signatures to the T2S Framework Agreement Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Frankfurt am Main, 8 May 2012 Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to welcome you to Frankfurt today on the occasion of the signing of the T2S Framework Agreement by a first group of central securities depositories, or CSDs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">T2S is an important project for the Eurosystem and for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">It is a key component of the European market infrastructure, and the Governing Council of the ECB remains committed to delivering it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">I fully share this commitment, and I am glad to be here today representing the Eurosystem, together with fellow Governor Visco, and other colleagues from National Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Allow me to thank them for taking the time to be here with us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I joined the Governing Council as Governor of Banca d’Italia in early 2006, and it was around that time that we started discussing T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">It was in July 2006 that we decided to consult and involve European CSDs and market participants, to ensure that T2S would fulfil the needs of the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">The main reason for the Eurosystem to embark on this project was to address the costly fragmentation of securities settlement market infrastructure, and to achieve greater technical harmonisation in the European securities settlement market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">T2S allows for efficient and integrated securities settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">The fundamental objective of T2S is to contribute to making Europe a better place to invest, by fostering a single market in post-trade services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">It will make financial markets safer and more efficient, and it will increase transparency in the post-trade environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Ultimately, investors will benefit from lower cross-border transaction and liquidity costs and from better investment possibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Issuers will benefit from deeper and more diversified sources of funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">T2S is important for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">It will be a major contribution to the strengthening of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The Single Market has already brought many benefits, which are, at times, forgotten or taken for granted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It is during times of crisis that we should not allow our commitment to the cause of further market integration to fade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It is during difficult times that we should remember the importance of cooperation and coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">There has been much progress towards further integration in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The most visible example was the adoption of the Single Market Act in April 2011 by the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A Single Market Act II will follow by the end of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">But there are many other ongoing initiatives, some of which had been started even before the outbreak of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Europe’s new supervisory structure has been developed in acknowledgement of the fact that the financial system of the EU is now very much interconnected, and the externalities arising from it are no longer confined to the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">There is also a comprehensive set of new legislation which aims to reform financial market regulation, covering not only the trading level, but also – for the first time – the infrastructure for clearing and settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">All these initiatives aim to create a level playing field in Europe, to remove barriers to competition, to facilitate cross-border business, and ultimately to strengthen the process of financial market integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">However, we should not forget that financial market integration needs to be complemented and supported by the integration of the underlying infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The Eurosystem’s most fundamental contribution to integration in this field is the creation of T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">T2S is therefore part of this important integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It brings to it an operational dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">It provides the integrated infrastructure necessary for creating a single market for settlement services in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">For this reason, the European authorities, and in particular the ECOFIN Council, have expressed their support for this project on more than one occasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Today’s event is therefore not only important for the market participants involved, but also for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">I would like to warmly congratulate the CSDs that are here with us today and have signed the T2S Framework Agreement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Without your valued support and active participation, T2S would simply not have been possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">I would also like to congratulate all those involved in the governance of T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">It is thanks to the combined efforts of all the T2S governing bodies that we have been able to reach this milestone in the project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Today’s signing of the T2S Framework Agreement will mark the start of an entirely new phase of the project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">From now on, the Eurosystem and the CSDs will be even more closely united in this mutual enterprise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The staff of our respective organisations will increasingly need to work together – like a single team – for the success of T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The time between now and the launch of T2S will pass by quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Much has already been achieved, but much of the hard work still lies ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">I am confident that our common T2S endeavours will continue to be a success, and I look forward to continuing our cooperation with the CSDs and with market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
