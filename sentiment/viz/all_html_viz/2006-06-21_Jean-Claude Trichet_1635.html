    <h1> Testimony before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament </h1>
    <h2> Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, European Parliament, Brussels, 21 June 2006 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)"> Testimony before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB,European Parliament, Brussels, 21 June 2006 Madame la Présidente, Mesdames et Messieurs les membres de la Commission des affaires économiques et monétaires, je me réjouis de paraître devant votre Commission aujourd’hui et de poursuivre ainsi notre dialogue régulier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Comme vous le savez, nos rencontres trimestrielles sont très importantes pour la Banque centrale européenne.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Je commencerai mon intervention par une évaluation de la situation économique et monétaire.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Anschließend möchte ich einige Ausführungen zum Beitrag der Geldpolitik zu wirtschaftlicher Wohlfahrt und Stabilität machen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Hiermit möchte ich nochmals die Grundprinzipien der Geldpolitik der EZB erläutern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Economic and monetary issues At the time of my last appearance before the European Parliament in February, I described how the available data at that time were in line with an assessment of a re-acceleration in economic growth in the euro area in the first months of 2006 and with a broadening of the expansion of economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">In addition, the cross-checking of our economic and monetary analyses underlined the prevalence of upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I will now present to you our current assessment of how the economy and the outlook for price stability have evolved since February.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Starting with the economic analysis, the main indicators that have become available since the start of 2006 are positive, providing further evidence that the economy is evolving broadly in line with the scenario for economic developments that emerged at the end of 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">According to Eurostat’s first estimate, real GDP in the euro area grew in the first quarter of 2006 by 0.6% on a quarter-on-quarter basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This compares with 0.3% in the last quarter of 2005, with domestic demand, including private consumption, making a significant contribution to higher real GDP growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Our previous expectation of a re-acceleration of real GDP growth in the first months of 2006 has thus materialised, confirming our assessment that economic growth is broadening and gradually becoming more sustained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This assessment is further confirmed by available information on economic activity in the second quarter, notably by the main confidence surveys and indicator-based estimates, all of which continue to provide encouraging signals on the evolution of the economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Looking further ahead, the conditions and economic fundamentals are in place for growth in the euro area to remain close to its trend potential rate on a sustained basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Economic growth in the euro area’s main trading partners remains strong, providing support for euro area exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Investment is expected to grow robustly, benefiting from favourable financing conditions, corporate balance sheet restructuring, and gains in earnings and business efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Furthermore, we expect consumption growth to further strengthen gradually over time, in line with developments in real disposable income, as the labour market situation, and in particular employment growth, gradually improves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">This outlook for economic developments is also reflected in the June 2006 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections, which foresee average annual real GDP growth between 1.8% and 2.4% in 2006, and between 1.3% and 2.3% in 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">These projections for growth in 2006 are broadly unchanged from the ECB staff projections of March 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.16,0)">For 2007 the latest projections are slightly lower, mainly reflecting the recent rise in oil prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The most recent forecasts by international organisations and private sector institutions also confirm a broadly similar picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In the view of the ECB’s Governing Council, risks to the outlook for economic growth provided by these projections are broadly balanced over the shorter term, while over the longer term downside risks relate mainly to potential further oil price rises, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and protectionism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Turning to price developments, according to Eurostat’s flash estimate, annual HICP inflation increased further in May, to reach 2.5% from 2.4% in April, largely as a consequence of higher energy price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">In the remainder of 2006 and in 2007, inflation rates are likely to remain elevated, with the precise levels depending mainly on future energy price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Meanwhile, the moderate evolution of labour costs in the euro area is expected to continue, notably reflecting ongoing global competitive pressures, particularly in the manufacturing sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">However, the indirect effects of past oil price increases are expected to have an upward effect on inflation in 2007, as already signalled inter alia by recently observed strong increases in industrial producer prices, which grew at an annual rate of 5.4% in April.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The announced changes in indirect taxes will also have a bearing on inflation next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.58,0)">This outlook for inflation is also reflected in the June 2006 Eurosystem staff projections, which foresee annual HICP inflation in a range between 2.1% and 2.5% in 2006, and between 1.6% and 2.8% in 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Compared with the March 2006 ECB staff projections, these ranges embody a slightly higher baseline profile for HICP inflation in 2006, largely reflecting the assumption of higher oil prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.08,0)">This outlook for price developments remains subject to upside risks including further increases in oil prices, a stronger pass-through of past oil price rises to consumer prices than currently anticipated, additional increases in administered prices and indirect taxes, and – more fundamentally – stronger than expected wage developments due to second-round effects of past oil price increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Turning to developments in monetary aggregates and credit, liquidity in the euro area remains ample by all reasonable measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The annual growth rate of M3 increased to 8.8% in April 2006, from 8.5% in March 2006, supported by the robust expansion of its most liquid components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Credit growth has also remained very strong, with the annual rate of growth of loans to the private sector standing at double-digit levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The rapid rate of monetary growth continues to be driven mainly by the expansion of its most liquid components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Thus, the latest developments confirm that the stimulative impact of the low level of interest rates remains the dominant factor behind the current high trend rate of monetary expansion, which signals inflationary risks over the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The further acceleration of monetary and credit growth in this environment of already ample liquidity points to increased upside risks to price stability at longer horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring, in particular in the context of continued strong dynamics in housing markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">To sum up, annual HICP inflation rates are projected to remain elevated in 2006 and 2007, mainly as a consequence of upward pressures from high oil prices and indirect taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.64,0)">Risks to this outlook for inflation remain on the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Against the backdrop of strong monetary and credit growth and the ample liquidity situation, the cross-checking of the outcome of the economic analysis with that of the monetary analysis confirms that upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term prevail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">On 8 June 2006 the ECB’s Governing Council increased the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points, thus further adjusting its monetary policy stance after the interest rate increases in December 2005 and March 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">By means of its timely further action, the Governing Council is helping to keep medium and long-term inflation expectations at levels which are in line with price stability, thereby making an ongoing contribution to sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Notwithstanding the increase in key ECB interest rates on 8 June, our monetary policy in the euro area remains accommodative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">It is essential to ensure that inflation expectations in the euro area remain firmly anchored at levels in line with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The firm anchoring of inflation expectations has permitted inter alia to maintain since the creation of the euro a low level of risk premia across the whole maturity spectrum, and to prevent costly wage-price spirals in the context of considerably higher oil prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">It is essential that this important asset of the euro area economy is preserved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The contribution of monetary policy to economic welfare and stability Having explained the more specific and current reasons for the ECB’s recent monetary policy moves, let me now put them in a broader perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">As you know, the Treaty states that, without prejudice to the primary objective of price stability, the Eurosystem shall support the general economic policies in the Community, aiming at a high level of employment and sustainable and non-inflationary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.59,0)">It is sometimes argued that the ECB’s overriding focus on price stability implies that we do not pay sufficient attention to this latter part of our mandate; in other words, that in our policy we do not attach sufficient importance to growth, employment and the welfare of European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">I would like to explain to you that these assumptions are misguided: price stability, and economic growth and employment, rather than being substitutes, are complements in a relationship which makes price stability a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The contribution of monetary policy to economic welfare and stability Price stability contributes to economic welfare and sustainable growth in many ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">An immediate way in which price stability contributes to welfare is by protecting the purchasing power of money, both for consumers and for savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">By protecting purchasing power, monetary policy also makes an important contribution to social cohesion, as the weakest groups of society are generally the least able to protect their savings against inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.08,0)">Moreover, inflation has the effect of transferring wealth from savers to debtors, as savers face a loss in the value of their assets, whereas the real value of debts diminishes as a result of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.33,0)">Maintaining price stability prevents such arbitrary and unjust redistributions of wealth and income brought about by inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Price stability also contributes to a better economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.06,0)">Inflation undermines the proper functioning of markets, as the information deriving from price developments becomes blurred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Stable prices, on the other hand, enable markets to better allocate resources to their most efficient use, which enhances growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">Very importantly, an environment of stable prices also reduces risk premia in medium- and long-term interest rates, as investors will not demand a high inflation risk premium to compensate them for the loss in purchasing power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">This reduces real medium- and long-term market interest rates and increases the incentives to invest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">All these arguments show that price stability provides a substantial contribution to economic growth and social welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Yet, against the backdrop of relatively low growth rates in Europe, it is sometimes asked whether we could not achieve higher growth rates by accepting a somewhat higher rate of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">History has clearly shown, however, that growth and employment cannot be increased by inflating the economy by means of a loose monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This means that in the long run an increase in the quantity of money will only lead to an increase in prices, whilst leaving the levels of growth and employment unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This implies that, in the long run, monetary policy can only influence the level of prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.21,0)">The levels of real income and employment are ultimately determined by real factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These include technological progress and productivity growth, the growth of the labour force and all structural aspects of the economy, such as the flexibility of goods and labour markets, tax policies and the quality of education, which are all outside the realm of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">By maintaining price stability, monetary policy is providing the conditions for such real factors to work better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The strong consensus among academics and policy-makers on the basic principles that I have outlined has not always existed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Forty years ago, there was a widespread view that monetary policy could durably raise the growth rate of the economy and that it could achieve permanently lower rates of unemployment by accepting higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.88,0)">This view was proven wrong by reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.1,0)">The inflationary policies adopted in the 1970s to counter the effects of the oil price shocks did not succeed in reducing unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.44,0)">On the contrary, these policies in fact only led to persistently higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.21,0)">In addition, these policies also caused large fluctuations in real activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.35,0)">By contrast, the recent oil price increases have had a limited effect on inflation and also on output and unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This has been the case because of the high credibility of the ECB in safeguarding price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Because of this high credibility, inflation expectations are now well-anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.55,0)">Since the public has remained convinced that inflation will remain low in the long run, the energy price increases have not generated significant second-round effects on wages and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">As a result, monetary policy has been able to maintain a more accommodative stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This stance has been decisive in counteracting the negative effects of the oil price increases on the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Price stability is the goal of monetary policies around the globe Today, the insight that price stability is the primary goal for monetary policy has also been translated into the mandates of central banks of advanced economies and also of a very large number of emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.73,0)">For instance, it is the case in the UK, it is the case in Japan, it is the case in Canada, in Australia and New Zealand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Price stability is the goal of modern monetary policy around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">This also holds true for the US Fed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.14,0)">The mandate of the Fed is sometimes contrasted with that of the ECB, because it comprises not only a goal of price stability but also the goals of maximum employment and moderate long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Although the Fed’s mandate does not establish a hierarchy among these goals, the Fed has made clear on a number of occasions that it considers price stability as a necessary condition for and the best contribution of monetary policy to achieving the highest level of welfare and sustainable economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The track record of the Fed in controlling inflation over the past decades speaks for itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The successive Chairmen of the Fed have made clear that the Fed considers price stability not only as a goal but also as a means for the Fed policy to achieve its other statutory goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is very much in line with our own framework and thinking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.8,0)">Conclusion To sum up, it is an error to think that a choice needs to be made between price stability on the one hand, and sustainable economic growth and welfare on the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Price stability is both a precondition for and a means to enhance durable economic growth and welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">That being said, we should all be aware that, if price stability is a necessary condition, it is not a sufficient condition per se for sustainable economic growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">As I have pointed out before, the growth potential of the euro area economy is ultimately determined by its structural features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.77,0)">That is the reason why the ECB calls so often upon policy-makers to embark resolutely on the structural reforms of the Lisbon Strategy and on the full completion of the internal market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Both would elevate the ‘speed limit’ of the EU and the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I am now ready to answer your questions.</span>
