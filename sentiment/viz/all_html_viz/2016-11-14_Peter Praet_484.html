    <h3> Speaker: Peter Praet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)"> Long-run saving and monetary policy Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Parliamentary evening on “Challenges for long term savings products in the context of the zero-interest rate policy”, Brussels, 14 November 2016 The European Central Bank   has carried out a number of unconventional monetary policy measures since the crisis to bring about a return of inflation to our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.94,0)">These measures include targeted long-term repos, negative deposit facility rates since 2014 and large-scale asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.27,0)">We have received criticism of these unconventional policies from some quarters surrounding their potential negative consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In the light of that criticism, I wanted to answer three crucial questions tonight relating to our unconventional measures: Why have we implemented them?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Have they been successful in their aims?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.75,0)">And, finally, have they had unduly large negative side effects on the distribution of wealth and income?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The determination of long-run interest rates First of all, I would like to spend a few moments discussing the determination of interest rates and what has happened to long-run interest rates over the past three decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.0,0)">These two things have significant bearing on the rest of my remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Put most simply, saving is the decision to forgo consumption today, in return for higher consumption in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.73,0)">Since people are by nature impatient, they require compensation for delaying consumption, compensation usually in the form of interest payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.78,0)">That compensation is paid for by those seeking to spend more today than their current income, such as people buying houses, or firms investing in new capital, who in return will not consume all their income in the future to repay the debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There are two parts to interest payments – the real component which is the extra amount of goods and services you can buy in the future relative to today and the inflation component which compensates for the changes in the prices of goods and services in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.89,0)">Long-run nominal interest rates have been falling across major advanced economies for more than three decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">In major part, this is due to the success of central banks in taming inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.7,0)">The expected inflation rate and the inflation risk premium incorporated into long-run interest rates have fallen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.64,0)">Yet changes in expected future inflation that are in turn realised are benign for savers – it is changes to the amount of goods and services that can be purchased in the future that matter, not changes in nominal prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.0,0)">But it is not just long-term nominal interest rates which have been declining; long-term real interest rates have also fallen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.25,0)">Factors beyond monetary policy have played a role in driving real rates lower, which are less benign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.89,0)">There has been a secular decline in productivity growth rates in advanced countries, and increased pessimism about future growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.84,0)">With lower expected return on capital, firms are more reluctant to invest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.63,0)">There has also been a savings-investment imbalance beyond that explained by the fall in productivity growth, often referred to as a “global savings glut”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.57,0)">In part, this is explained by the ageing populations of advanced countries, driving up the demand for safe assets at a time when they have become increasingly scarce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.51,0)">This falling real rate is bad news for savers since it means lower future returns in terms of consumption of additional goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And in the long run it is the concept of the natural rate that determines the return to saving, not short-term movements in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This concept of a natural rate of interest represents the real rate consistent with saving and investment being in balance, output being at its potential and neither upward nor downward pressure on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.53,0)">While the natural rate may change over time, it is unobserved and can only be estimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.42,0)">Such estimation is relatively imprecise, with different models giving a range of estimates making it uncertain as to the true level of the natural rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.05,0)">Nonetheless, the natural rate does appear to be lower than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Why unconventional measures have been necessary Developments in the natural rate matter for the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">To stimulate the economy, central banks steer short-term real interest rates below the natural rate to encourage the public to bring forward spending, be it in the form of consumption or investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.62,0)">As the natural rate falls, so does the rate that stimulates the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">With the natural rate now lower in the euro area, and the significant downward shock to output and inflation from the crisis, negative rates, and our other policy measures, have been necessary to stimulate demand and drive inflation towards our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.94,0)">There is a limit to how low short-term rates can go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.62,0)">Since the return on cash is zero, at some point the public will switch to using cash and disintermediate the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.85,0)">Of course, there are costs involved in holding large quantities in cash, so the crossover point lies a little way below zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Given that there is a limit to how low interest rates can go, other unconventional measures have to come into play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.66,0)">There is not just one short-term interest rate that matters for saving and borrowing decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Our asset purchase and targeted long-term repo programmes seek to influence the entire constellation of rates that affect economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">We have provided guidance that we will not withdraw stimulus until output and inflation are on sustainable paths.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">But let me emphasise once more, these measures were necessary given the size of the crisis and the already low natural rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Effectiveness of the unconventional measures That brings me to my second question, have the unconventional measures been successful?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The short answer is yes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The euro area economy is recovering steadily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.85,0)">Unemployment is falling, reaching 10% in the third quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.79,0)">Youth unemployment fell to 20.6% in the third quarter and continues to decline more rapidly than the overall unemployment rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Bank lending to households and companies is growing, while demand for loans is rising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.95,0)">ECB simulations showed that euro area GDP would be cumulatively at least 1.5% lower between 2015 and 2018 without the expansionary policy measures, with worse outcomes for inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">And more than that: by acting timely and decisively we preserved future growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.74,0)">There is a growing awareness of the potential permanent negative effects of prolonged downturns, a process termed hysteresis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There are a number of channels through which hysteresis works.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.89,0)">Unemployed people lose valuable human capital and skills that may take time to recover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.19,0)">They may also become permanently discouraged from working, reducing long-run participation in the labour force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.45,0)">The distressingly high rates of youth unemployment witnessed in many euro area economies are likely to cause some labour market “scarring”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.96,0)">Prolonged downturns may also cause businesses to become increasingly uncertain about future prospects, causing them to delay investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">This has the dual effect of depressing current economic activity, which reinforces the downturn, and reducing the amount of capital available for future production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.05,0)">Lower future growth translates directly into lower natural rates today, something I shall return to shortly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.5,0)">Other potential consequences of unconventional measures While our measures have been successful in their aim of stabilising output and inflation, they also carry risks in terms of allocation of resources and distribution of wealth and income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.43,0)">Potential risks include blunting the creative destruction of the crisis by allowing unproductive, zombie firms to remain in business and permitting the inflation of asset bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.33,0)">Some have also raised concerns that low interest rates have reduced incentives for governments to carry out difficult fiscal and structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These topics are complex and deserve a greater depth of comment than I have time to cover today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.97,0)">Given the audience here tonight, I wanted to focus on two particular potential consequences of our unconventional measures: the impact on the distribution of wealth and income, and the impact on bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">To an extent, monetary policy always works through a redistribution of activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Lowering interest rates encourages households to bring forward to today some consumption planned for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.71,0)">Some have argued that negative rates have the perverse effect of forcing savers, such as those with a fixed savings target for retirement, to save more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.91,0)">But such an argument is not borne out by the data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.89,0)">Since the introduction of the negative rate on our deposit facility, saving rates across the euro area have remained broadly stable, or have fallen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The only major country to have some rise is Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">However, the profile of the German saving rate also reflects the ongoing recovery in the residential investment sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.33,0)">But before I analyse more deeply the distributional impact of monetary policy action by the ECB, let me first consider the distributional impact of monetary policy inaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">These effects are clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.73,0)">Economic activity would have been lower and unemployment – particularly youth unemployment – higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.46,0)">This would have had a disproportionately higher impact on the incomes of the poor and the young.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">At the same time, inflation would have been lower, which research shows transfers wealth from younger households to older households, who are more likely to be savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.0,0)">So the ECB not acting also carried distributional implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.66,0)">Further, the deeper and more prolonged recession would likely bring about greater hysteresis, depressing future growth and hence returns for savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.43,0)">Overall, households would have been worse off had the ECB not acted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.44,0)">Counterfactual discussions aside, how have households fared across the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To gauge the effect on different euro area households, we can draw upon results from the Eurosystem’s Household Finance and Consumption Survey  , conducted in 2010 and 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.59,0)">Even though these surveys do not cover the period since the introduction of the negative deposit facility rate, they do coincide with declines of 2-year euro area benchmark bond yields by 130 basis points and 10-year bonds by 110 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.76,0)">Euro area net financial income as a fraction of total household income fell slightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.42,0)">When looking more closely at households grouped by wealth quintiles, we find that households with the lowest net wealth, whose debt payments are higher than their financial income, had an unchanged position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.92,0)">Households with the highest net wealth, whose financial income is much higher than their debt, had the most marked fall in income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.89,0)">But while net financial income has fallen for the wealthiest households, the same is not true for wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.53,0)">Wealthier households tend to have a greater amount of housing wealth and house prices have risen since the introduction of negative interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Extrapolating the HFCS forward using changes in equity, bond and house price data shows increases in the net wealth for every wealth quintile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The ECB’s policy measures have been unambiguously positive for euro-area governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.37,0)">Germany alone saved approximately 28 billion euro in 2015 in lower than expected interest payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Such payments would ultimately have been financed from lower spending or higher taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Broadly speaking, the lower income the household sector has received from income payments from government bonds, either directly or intermediated through the banking sector needs to be offset against lower tax liabilities now or in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.96,0)">Indeed, research by Deutsche Bank  shows that the impact of low and negative interest rates on the returns of German household financial assets has been limited so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">This was in part due to revaluation gains on the back of the ECB’s asset purchase programme as well as interest income from investment funds and insurance and pension products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">It is still possible for savers to gain positive real returns by holding a diversified portfolio of assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.97,0)">Bank deposits may currently be giving a negative real return, but as research by the Bundesbank also shows, negative real returns on bank deposits is the norm, not the exception in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.39,0)">But savers are not the only sector potentially affected by negative rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.71,0)">Low and negative rates depress net interest margins for banks since lending rates fall, but there is a floor to deposit rates caused by the effective lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">To date, ECB staff estimates show the impact of our policy measures has been net positive for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Net interest margins have certainly been compressed, but that has been offset by a greater flow of lending as economic activity is higher, lower incidence of non-performing loans, again due to lower servicing costs and greater levels of activity, and revaluations of fixed income portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.08,0)">Over time, the revaluation effects will fade and the squeeze on net interest margins may intensify.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.02,0)">Future expected profitability may also suffer if banks react to lower overall returns by extending riskier loans, which in turn may sour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.29,0)">Overall, potential negative side effects from low rates on banking sector profitability are likely to intensify the longer they are used, which is precisely why they are envisaged as short-term measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.14,0)">But our unconventional measures are not the only headwind for financial sector profitability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.79,0)">The overhang of non-performing loans from the financial and sovereign debt crises continue to weigh on banks’ profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">At the same time, a number of jurisdictions are marked by overcapacity in banking and have average cost to income ratios markedly above those seen elsewhere in Europe and other advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.26,0)">Finally, banks are under increasing competition from non-banks and the FinTech sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.69,0)">It is certainly a challenging time on many fronts for euro area banks, and many will have to consider carefully their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Such efforts need to go hand-in-hand with further steps towards closer cross-border integration: completing banking union is crucial to allow banks to compete internationally as euro area banks and not only as national champions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">We need a single euro area regulatory approach that will facilitate cross-border mergers, acquisitions and investment, thereby enhancing diversification, risk-sharing and efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Only by completing what we started can we reap the full benefits of banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Changes are also likely needed from savings products frequently used in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I believe that the really important question to debate tonight is not quite the published title, but instead: what are the challenges for long-term saving products in the presence of a low natural rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusion Let me sum up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The ECB’s unconventional policy measures over recent years have been necessary to react to the severe negative shock arising from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.88,0)">They differ from conventional policy measures taken before the crisis in part because of impairments to the transmission mechanism caused by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.85,0)">But in major part the measures are a result of the ECB adapting to the secular downward shift in equilibrium interest rates over the past three decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The measures have been successful in stabilising output, helping to reduce unemployment and have begun to help steer inflation back towards our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">We will keep the measures in place until output growth and inflation are back on sustainable paths.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">While some redistribution between households is inevitable with monetary policy actions, it is clear that to date there has not been an inequitable redistribution in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.55,0)">Indeed, the distributional consequences of policy inaction would have been worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The ECB will continue to use appropriate measures available in our mandate to achieve our inflation objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This includes the temporary use of the unconventional measures introduced since the crisis until growth and inflation are once more self-sustaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">In enhancing macroeconomic stability and inhibiting the short-term effects of the crisis from weighing on long-term economic prospects, monetary policy is providing its best possible support to long-run saving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">And it is important to view the contribution of monetary policy in the wider context of macroeconomic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Fiscal policy can play a greater role in stimulating demand, reducing the burden on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.52,0)">Public investment as a share of GDP has declined for a number of years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">It is vital that fiscal authorities re-balance towards more growth-friendly policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.36,0)">Furthermore, the secular decline in rates is not inevitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Structural reforms are needed to unleash the productive potential of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.95,0)">Such reforms fall beyond the remit of the ECB and are the responsibility of other national and European policymakers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Now is the perfect time for such reforms, since the current accommodative policy of the ECB can help offset any short-term adjustment costs of their implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is a window of opportunity that needs to be seized.</span><span style="background-color:
