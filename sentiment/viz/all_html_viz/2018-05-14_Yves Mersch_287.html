    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.7,0)"> Virtual currencies ante portas Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 39th meeting of the Governor’s Club Bodrum, Turkey,14 May 2018 New innovations based on distributed ledger technology   and blockchain have brought about wide-spread euphoria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.0,0)">Their use to create “cryptocurrencies” or “virtual currencies”   – to denote their lack of legal recognition – is often touted as something that could fundamentally change the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The spectacular rise in the market valuation of VCs over the past year suggests that many people shared this belief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In the course of 2017 the global VC pool both deepened, from USD 30 billion to USD 400 billion, and widened, with the proliferation of “initial coin offerings” or “ICOs” – virtual fundraising facilities for start-up investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.81,0)">But in my view, the subsequent market plunge rather points to a fading fad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.85,0)">From December to February the price of bitcoin, the top dog among VCs, fell from almost USD 20,000 to below USD 7,000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Don’t get me wrong: I am an ardent believer in progress through innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Technological progress can provide us with significant efficiency gains and increases in general welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Perhaps DLT and blockchain can do just that .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.88,0)">But I am very sceptical towards the use of these technologies to create currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Although they combine decentralised payments and label them as currency, VCs are still not legitimised by any authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Moreover, VCs rely on financial intermediation via exchanges and wallet providers to re-enter the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Any fiat money requires trust to gain and maintain the acceptance of those who use it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Indeed, history has shown that confidence in public money is best provided by a trusted issuing authority, that is, an independent central bank issuing safe and stable liabilities that people can access and hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Trust in a central bank, in turn, is created and sustained via legal safeguards, a clear price stability mandate and a sufficient degree of democratic accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In contrast, nobody is liable for VCs, nor are they backed by any trustworthy authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.0,0)">Under these circumstances, it may well be that VCs will fail, as so many other earlier forms of money did.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">There are, at present, more than 1,500 VCs in circulation, with dozens of new schemes being launched monthly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.82,0)">The total value outstanding has fluctuated sharply, largely because of speculative activity, and most have failed to attract users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.31,0)">Yet authorities need to be aware of the potential risks they pose for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.61,0)">Are VCs the latest incarnation of money?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The answer for now, and indeed for the foreseeable future, is no.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.67,0)">What is money?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Economists identify money as a verifiable asset that serves as a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">How well do VCs carry out those functions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.94,0)">First, VCs’ performance as a medium of exchange is weak – to say the least.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.65,0)">Some have attained patchy acceptance – the largest at present, bitcoin, is accepted by some retail outlets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.85,0)">But on a global scale these outlets remain small in number, and hardly any actual transactions take place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">On a daily basis, there are around 200,000 bitcoin transactions globally, compared with 330 million retail payments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.15,0)">Bitcoin is far inferior to existing payment options.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.0,0)">Transactions generally require confirmation from six miners, which can take an hour, or potentially much longer due to network congestion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.82,0)">Bitcoin payments are also expensive: the cost varies over time, but reached €25 in December 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.48,0)">And even if recent claims put the price at between €1 and €30 and the processing time at under ten minutes, this compares poorly to 0.2 euro cents and a maximum of ten seconds for transactions on the forthcoming TARGET Instant Payment Settlement   service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.69,0)">The second function of money is acting as a unit of account, without which buyers and sellers would not be able to measure the value of a particular good or service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.52,0)">VCs fail this test – none of them are generally accepted as a unit of account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.88,0)">In part this is due to the lack of widespread recognition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.46,0)">VCs are not legal tender and are not backed by a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.49,0)">Moreover, their prices are too volatile to establish a reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.23,0)">But the lack of acceptance as a unit of account is also down to the third function of money – being a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.26,0)">VCs exhibit wild fluctuations in value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">For instance, the average volatility of the top ten VCs by market capitalisation was more than 25 times higher than that of the US equities market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.92,0)">Such fluctuations mean that businesses setting prices in VCs could find themselves with a large and detrimental gap between their actual price and their optimal price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Similarly, households cannot rely on VCs as a stable store of value to optimise their spending over time by saving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.92,0)">VCs have neither intrinsic value, such as the commodity content of gold coins, nor extrinsic value, such as the value assigned to traditional fiat currencies by the trusted public issuing authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.38,0)">It is very clear that VCs currently do not fulfil the three basic functions of money: they are inefficient media of exchange, poor stores of value and are not used as units of account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.66,0)">It is these failures that make the label “currency” a misnomer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.95,0)">Potential impact of virtual currencies Yet even if VCs are not money, public authorities should still be aware of the potential risks they pose for financial stability – although currently these markets are too small to be of systemic importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.16,0)">VCs are inherently risky compared to conventional financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.4,0)">They are excessively volatile and illiquid due to the fragmented nature of unregulated exchanges and their high ownership concentration: 96% of current bitcoin holdings are estimated to be held by 2.5% of users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.85,0)">This facilitates price manipulation and other misconduct and is further compounded by operational and technical weaknesses of the underlying technology .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Yet, VCs do not appear to pose material financial stability risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.52,0)">One reason is that they are small compared to the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The market capitalisation of VCs was USD 432 billion in early 2018, about 1.5% of the market capitalisation of the S&P500.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">But the significant rise in the market valuation of VCs we saw prior to December 2017 calls for caution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.92,0)">If, in the future, such a boom led to a large enough VC market, it could become a factor that affects financial stability in the event of a crash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Such risks could intensify via several channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.81,0)">Wealth effects could disrupt financial stability not only through consumer spending but also through collateral valuation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.62,0)">If VCs were indeed used as collateral for loans, a fall in the value of such collateral could lead to margin calls and increased defaults, with knock-on effects on borrowing and economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.7,0)">The effects of a crash could be further magnified if VC investors were highly leveraged .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.9,0)">Not only would investors lack equity to absorb losses, but losses would also spread to creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Moreover, the use of derivative contracts could spread the losses more broadly across the economy by allowing other market participants to hold leveraged positions against VCs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.41,0)">A crash could affect the stability of the wider financial system if big banks were to hold huge unhedged exposures to VCs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.45,0)">Similarly, the widespread use of VCs for payment or settlement could affect economic transactions on a large scale and disrupt the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Amid such potential risks, resolute ring-fencing measures may be needed to safeguard the integrity of financial sector services, protect investors and consumers, and prevent negative spill-overs to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.11,0)">The four broad areas that require particular attention are:   VCs themselves;   the facilitators – VC exchanges, wallet-providers and brokers;   financial market infrastructures  ; and   the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.73,0)">Regulating virtual currencies VCs cannot be directly regulated or overseen in the absence of a centralised governance and legal framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.08,0)">In fact, most VCs are “mined” peripherally by a computer programme explicitly to prevent any one legal entity being in control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.36,0)">Several countries have banned VCs outright or ring-fenced them from the financial sector, notably China, where VCs were very active and computing capacity was concentrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.43,0)">In most countries regulatory action has focused on issuing warnings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the United States for instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission   outlined more than 30 questions that had to be answered before it would give the green light to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds   that invest in VCs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Some countries have adopted “regulatory sandboxes”, granting fintechs active in VCs temporary, conditional exceptions to regulatory requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.12,0)">Although such sandboxes may be useful to try and test regulation, they clearly risk incentivising regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">We ultimately need global answers in the absence of a defined jurisdiction for VC issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">At their meeting this year in Buenos Aires, the G20 finance ministers and central bank governors acknowledged that technological innovation, including DLT and blockchain, had the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.45,0)">They warned, however, of the risks stemming from VCs regarding consumer and investor protection, market integrity, tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing, not least because VCs lack the key attributes of sovereign currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Ministers and governors therefore committed to extending global standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing to VCs, and called on international standard-setters to monitor VCs closely – and assess multilateral responses where needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.07,0)">Restraining the facilitators Let me turn to the facilitators of VCs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We need to hold VC exchanges to the same rigorous standards as the rest of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">For this purpose, the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive will bring VC exchanges and wallet-providers within the scope of anti-money laundering   and combating the financing of terrorism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">But we need a broader perspective on regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Possible regulatory action to extend licensing and supervision rules to VC facilitators could be explored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Protecting financial market infrastructures Third, I would like to cover financial market infrastructure services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">One of the key questions is whether VCs could become a settlement asset in payment and settlement services or be used in the clearing domain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.8,0)">Existing standards for FMIs refer to the usage of “a settlement asset with little or no credit and liquidity risk” .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.39,0)">While this appears to exclude settlement involving VCs, such standards do not systematically apply to all FMIs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The situation is similar in the field of securities settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Could VCs be used as an asset for settling securities transactions or constitute a security per se?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The answer hinges on whether they could be legally characterised as a “financial instrument” under the applicable regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.12,0)">And this depends on whether crypto-assets allow the identification of an issuer who can be held liable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The use of VCs at central counterparties   should also be monitored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Here too, standards require CCPs to accept highly liquid collateral with minimal credit and market risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">While it is doubtful that a VC would meet such a requirement, clear guidelines ex ante would be helpful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.21,0)">In my view, there’s a need to examine whether any VC activity carried out by FMIs should have to be ring-fenced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.19,0)">The enforcement of segregated accounts and liabilities could be discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">FMIs play an important role in financial markets, and any liquidity support offered by central banks should be to mitigate shocks emanating from the real economy, not from gambling in risky assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Regulating banks Finally, we need to look at the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Due to the high volatility of VCs it might seem appropriate to require any VC trading to be backed by adequate levels of capital, and segregated from other trading and investment activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.54,0)">Given the risks posed by leverage, banks should not accept VCs as collateral, or should only accept them with haircuts that appropriately reflect past volatility and liquidity, as well as market and operational risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Likewise, limits on leverage could be examined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Do VCs herald a new world of money?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.15,0)">No, virtual currencies are a misnomer in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.9,0)">They are not money, nor will they become money in the foreseeable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.36,0)">They lack the official recognition and backing of a public authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.25,0)">Their market share is still small, the amount of money at risk in financial market infrastructures is insignificant and their ties to the real economy are still limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.31,0)">But this can change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Authorities should therefore pay close attention to mitigating the potential risks that could stem from a growing VC market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.56,0)">We have to be mindful not to have the complex and interlinked financial system contaminated by immature technologies or shallow business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Interfaces and gatekeepers require particular scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Likewise, we should not succumb to the temptation to sacrifice the achievement of a level playing field for innovative advances that are aimed at regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.49,0)">But I don’t want to sound too negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is not unknown for new innovations to bring about euphoria, which in turn fuels bubbles that eventually burst.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.98,0)">Still, just because the initial euphoria subsequently fades, does not mean that the innovation itself is without virtue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">These virtual currencies are clearly not suitable for use as money, but the underlying technology may, in time, become useful and widespread.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">And although we at the ECB don’t intend to introduce a central bank digital currency for the foreseeable future, we are actively experimenting with the technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">We will be able to cater for changing needs in trusted and stable central bank liabilities that are accessible to the citizens, if and when this becomes necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.78,0)">65.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.47,0)">In January 2018 Tokyo-based VC exchange Coincheck was hacked and €430 million of virtual currency was stolen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A survey found that 20% of VC asset owners used debt to finance purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.0,0)">, “Bitcoin on credit?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">For 20 percent of owners, that’s yes”, Bloomberg, 7 February 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The SEC’s concerns relate, in particular, to how mutual funds or ETFs propose to store, safeguard, and price VCs and how they would address elevated risks of fraud and manipulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">“  We acknowledge that technological innovation, including that underlying crypto-assets, has the potential to improve the efficiency and inclusiveness of the financial system and the economy more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.84,0)">Crypto-assets do, however, raise issues with respect to consumer and investor protection, market integrity, tax evasion, money laundering and terrorist financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.76,0)">Crypto-assets lack the key attributes of sovereign currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.24,0)">At some point they could have financial stability implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.85,0)">”, see the G20 communiqué of finance ministers and central bank governors.</span><span
