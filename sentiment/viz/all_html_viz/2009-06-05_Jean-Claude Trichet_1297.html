    <span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)"> The times of unprecedented challenges Address by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB at the conference“20 years after the collapse of the socialist economy: transformation, economic growth and convergence in Poland and other central and eastern European countries” organised by the National Bank of Poland,Warsaw, 5 June 2009 Dear President Kaczyński,dear President Klaus,dear President Skrzypek,dear Joaquín,dear Governors,Ladies and gentlemen, We are celebrating today the 20th anniversary of Poland’s first free elections after the Second World War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This is a historic moment not only for Poland but also for Europe as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.33,0)">Without the courageous actions by the Polish people at the time, this country might not be part of the European Union today, and Europe might even be still divided in East and West.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">By holding its first democratic elections two decades ago, Poland – together with the other Central and Eastern European countries – had set the most important pre-accession requirement to join the European Union in May 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It was a historic re-unification of Europe after decades of division.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Today, the EU is a family of 27 members, 16 of which share the euro as a common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">On the road to the EU: convergence and integration During the past two decades, Poland has gone through a long and challenging process of transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">The fruits of this process are clearly visible today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Over the past 20 years Polish GDP per capita more than tripled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In recent years Poland has also made progress on the structural side, for instance, by improving labour market flexibility and by limiting the very costly early retirement schemes that were in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">At the same time, the adoption of an inflation targeting framework at the National Bank of Poland back in 1998 has been an important step towards bringing inflation down and closer to a level that is consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The catching-up process has been accompanied by a strong economic and financial integration with the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Jacques Delors – the former Commission President – once defined the European integration as a triad: competition, which stimulates us, cooperation, which strengthens us, and solidarity which unites us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.81,0)">Let me briefly spell out his words in today’s context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">First, competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The historic enlargement of the European Union in 2004 has extended the border of our common internal market eastwards, thus unleashing the beneficial forces of competition in these countries whilst providing for a solid regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Polish businesses are part of a single market of half a billion people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Second, cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The joint efforts to tackle the financial crises are perhaps the most prominent recent example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">But cooperation has gone a long way in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">In the EU we have developed common institutions and common policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">And we have found ways to overcome differences and find common solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Third, solidarity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Solidarity is an essential part of Europe’s common roots and values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Solidarity among the peoples of Europe was the explicit aim of the founding fathers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.87,0)">Why was this?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Because they believed that a de facto solidarity, a linkage of their interests, would prevent a new war.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me quote a passage from the Schuman declaration of 9 May 1950: “Europe will not be made all at once, or according to a single plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">It will be built through concrete achievements which first create a de facto solidarity.” It is in this spirit that EU solidarity has bolstered EU integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">In the case of Poland, concrete signposts of EU solidarity can be spotted all along Poland’s long road towards EU integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">EU solidarity started well before accession, with Poland joining the PHARE programme already in 1989 and receiving pre-accession support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This solidarity continued after accession, in the form of an important flow of EU funds, especially in the context of EU cohesion and agricultural policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">To give but one example, net transfers from the EU budget to Poland amounted to EUR 5.1 billion in 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Solidarity did also not come to a halt during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.89,0)">Poland – like virtually all countries in the global economy– has been affected by the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Not because its financial institutions were particularly exposed to the US sub-prime market, but because it has become an integral part of the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that Poland has so far fared relatively better than some of its neighbouring countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In coping with the crisis within the EU, solidarity was fundamental.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Let me just mention some concrete achievements in terms of solidarity within the European Union: first, increased financing available under the Medium Term Financial Assistance   facility, which rose from EUR 12 billion in 2002 to EUR 25 billion in 2008 and then again to EUR 50 billion in May this year; second, increased ceilings for EIB lending of at least EUR 8.5 billion during 2009 and 2010; and third, accelerated payments of structural funds of EUR 6.3 billion in 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">In addition, only a few days ago, the Commission put forward plans to accelerate payments under the European Social Fund for an amount of EUR 19 billion in 2009-2010 alone, an important part of which   is destined for Central and Eastern European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Together with the liquidity provisions extended by the ECB to a number of countries, the total amount of funds earmarked by the EU to its members and neighbours to tackle the crisis exceeds EUR 70 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">It is indeed quite natural for the EU to exercise its solidarity in these days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is solidarity that makes us a community and a union, not just a market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.53,0)">But solidarity is not a panacea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It is no substitute for sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">In fact, the crisis has highlighted once again the importance of a solid structural economic foundation for sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In this respect, it is striking to see how different the impact of the global financial crisis has been across individual countries, both in terms of financial market responses and with respect to real economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.43,0)">The fact that the impact of the global financial crisis has been considerably less pronounced in Poland as compared to its regional peers, might have various reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The most important one, in my view, is that Poland has built-up less of macroeconomic imbalances and that it has implemented a set of policies and reforms that have overall been appropriate in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.62,0)">In contrast, some other countries had accumulated large domestic and external imbalances, and these made them vulnerable to changes in international investor sentiment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.31,0)">Larger current account deficits imply a greater reliance on external finance and thus a larger sensitivity to a disruption in cross-border capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Sound macroeconomic policies are therefore not only prerequisites for a successful participation in the economic and monetary union, but they are also necessary for the catching-up process to operate smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">It is after the elimination of major macroeconomic imbalances and when sufficient convergence has been achieved, that countries can expect to reap the full benefits of euro area membership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The ECB’s response to the financial crises The experience of the past year and a half bears testimony that the euro has continued to be an anchor of stability in times of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.0,0)">Let me explain to you why this is so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The financial turmoil crystallises two principal tenets behind our monetary policy strategy: swift and flexible action guided by a steady and unwavering compass.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">From the onset of the crisis in August 2007 we were determined to do what was needed to alleviate the tensions in money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">We did not hesitate to charter unknown territory and to move forcefully to counter the adverse consequences of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">At the same time, we always kept our medium-term perspective fade in mind, and inflation expectations remained fully anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.86,0)">The Governing Council made always clear that we would not compromise – in any respect – the longer-term achievement of the price stability objective or encourage or tolerate imprudent behaviour by market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">The specific and targeted changes to our operational framework – some of which can be called ‘non-standard’ – have played a critical role: they have been instrumental in organising the defence against the systemic liquidity risk that occurred in September last year and in preserving the availability of credit for households and companies at accessible rates, thereby creating the conditions for the best possible transmission of our subsequent easing of monetary conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.26,0)">We cut our key interest rate in a series of seven unprecedented steps by a cumulative 325 basis points within about half a year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The Eurosystem is currently providing unlimited refinancing at 1.0% in its main refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">From a historical perspective, these measures are unprecedented in terms of their breadth and depth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">At the same time, these measures have been taken in full consistency with our monetary policy framework and our primary objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The crisis has not changed this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In contrast, the fundamental principle on which our actions were based on is that any course of policy – conventional or unconventional – should be firmly grounded on and directed to the achievement of the Eurosystem’s primary objective of preserving price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This objective will always provide the context and limits within which our course of action is framed and enacted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The evidence on our bold yet solidly anchored response to the crises is encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">While long-term inflation expectations continue to remain broadly anchored at levels consistent with price stability, our measures show some signs of revival in the functioning of money markets in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Banks are at the heart of the financial system in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This is the main reason why our policy response so far has been tailored to the specific nature of Europe’s financial structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">It is also the reason why the Governing Council decided in its meeting in May to proceed with its enhanced credit support approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Our enhanced liquidity provision supports banks in continuing their lending operations to firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In full continuity and consistency with the operations we have undertaken since October 2008, we have delivered an array of policy decisions that provide further support to improve market liquidity in important segments of the private debt security market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Yesterday, we decided on the implementation of the programme for purchases of euro-denominated covered bonds issued in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The decision to buy covered bonds was motivated from the fact that these bonds are a segment of the private securities markets that has been particularly affected by the financial turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">We trust that all these measures will continue to contribute to restoring and fostering confidence among banks, companies and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Confidence today relies equally upon our immediate agility of action and upon the soundness and credibility of our exit strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Once the macroeconomic environment improves, the Governing Council will ensure that the measures taken can be quickly unwound and the liquidity provided absorbed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Hence, any threat to price stability over the medium and longer term will be effectively countered in a timely fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">I observe, in particular, that the concentration of our non-standard measures on the supply of liquidity, with full allotment, to banks, provides for an in-built exit strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.97,0)">That is, when tensions in financial markets ease, banks will automatically seek less credit from the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This will be a decisive element in ensuring a non-inflationary recovery in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.38,0)">This is a time of unprecedented uncertainty and challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We all have to live up to our responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">We have to respond forcefully to the challenge, but we should never forget the principles for sound macro-economic policy making that are at the heart of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The people of Poland know what it means to go through times of unprecedented uncertainty and challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Their courage and their determination, which we celebrate today, is a reminder of how to cope with challenging situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">We are looking forward to overcoming this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The ECB’s commitment to maintaining price stability over the medium term, as laid down in the Treaty, will contribute to paving the way for future sustainable growth, job creation and economic prosperity in all Member States.</span>
