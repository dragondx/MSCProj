    <span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)"> Speech at the European Mortgage Federation Annual Conference Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBEuropean Mortgage Federation Annual Conference“Capital Markets and Financial Integration in Europe”Genval, 23 November 2004 Introduction I was delighted to accept the invitation to what I expect to be a very stimulating and important conference on the rapidly evolving market of housing finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">I would like to share with you our views on the integration of mortgage capital markets from a central bank perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">As all central banks, the ECB is deeply interested in the emergence of a single, integrated, competitive and well functioning capital market in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">The integration of capital markets is an important prerequisite for an effective transmission of monetary policy to the real economy, and an efficient allocation of savings to the most profitable investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.88,0)">With a segmented, inefficient and badly functioning capital market, changes in interest rates or liquidity conditions may have different – even unpredictable – effects across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.92,0)">My general assessment of what has been achieved in financial integration of capital markets in Europe is mixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">As regards wholesale capital markets, where the counterpart of the financial institution is the market itself, the introduction of the euro and the measures adopted under the Financial Services Action Plan have significantly spurred the integration of the government bond market, and to a lesser extent of the corporate bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">However, in the retail area, where the counterpart of the financial institution is a household or a small firm, market segmentation remains strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Obviously the mortgage market, given its sheer size and strong potential for growth, is a key retail market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Outstanding volume of mortgage loans exceed EUR 4 trillion, growing at approximately 8 % per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">On the funding side, covered bonds form the second largest capital market segment, after government bonds, with an outstanding amount of more than EUR 1.5 trillion accounting for approximately 16.5% of GDP in the EU 15 in 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Against this background, prospects for further integration of this important market are of high interest to the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I have organised my remarks as follows: I will begin with an assessment of the state of integration of the European mortgage market, with a particular focus on the funding side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">I will then look across the ocean to see to what extent we can learn from the experience of the US mortgage capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Thereafter I will discuss factors at work that may push the mortgage financing market in Europe towards more integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.61,0)">The mortgage market remains highly fragmented Housing is the main asset and mortgage debt is the main liability held by households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.61,0)">Loan for house purchase grew by 7-9 % during the past 5 years and still the household debt to GDP ratio, estimated at 55%, in the euro area is relatively low by international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">There are big differences in household indebtedness across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Economic performance of a country, fiscal treatment of mortgages and local housing market characteristics as well as attitudes vis-à-vis home ownership versus renting play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.77,0)">The mortgage market remains highly fragmented in Europe, both at the level of mortgage products available to homebuyers and at the level of mortgage funding instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.66,0)">In no national markets borrowers are faced with a full range of mortgage products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.77,0)">Origination standards differ as well as standards for servicing loans, and only few banks originate and service mortgage loans in more than one country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Less than 40% of mortgages are financed via the capital market, the remainder is deposit financed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.78,0)">The two capital market instruments to fund mortgages - covered bonds and residential mortgage backed securities  - are heterogeneous across countries because of differences in legal, tax and regulatory frameworks governing issuance in the respective jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.81,0)">Those cross-country differences have prevented a geographic diversification to take place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.18,0)">So far mortgage loan portfolios that underlie covered bond issuance or are backing RMBS transactions have been purely domestic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Among the two capital market funding tools, the covered bond market is the more developed and significantly larger capital market funding tool, although RMBS transactions have seen tremendous growth over the past five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In 2003, outstanding amounts of covered bonds exceeded EUR 1.5 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.74,0)">No official data on outstanding amounts of RMBS transactions is available, but rough estimates point towards outstanding volumes of around EUR 300 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.08,0)">Cross country differences in capital market funding tools continue to be huge: Some countries such as Germany and Denmark tend to rely exclusively on covered bonds to fund mortgages, while other countries, such as the Netherlands and until recently also the UK, have used primarily securitisation as a funding tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Only Spain appears to be active in both capital market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.14,0)">The lack of integration of the mortgage capital market comes at a cost, both for issuers and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.45,0)">The limited degree of standardisation prevents the realisation of economies of scale, and may result therefore in higher funding costs for originators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.67,0)">Moreover, it makes it costly for investors to achieve geographical diversification, and prevents in particular foreign investors from entering the market on a large scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Hence, despite its huge size, the benefits of this capital market segment cannot be fully reaped at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">What lessons to draw from the US mortgage capital market?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The US mortgage capital market is huge, roughly three times as big as the European mortgage capital market, and highly liquid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The two major US housing agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, have been the catalyst for this impressive growth of the secondary market for mortgages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Moreover, they have facilitated a high degree of standardisation by allowing the value chain of mortgages – origination, servicing and funding – to be decomposed into its individual elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This has allowed market participants to reap substantial economies of scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">However, notwithstanding their positive impact on the mortgage capital market evolution, the US housing agencies cannot be a model for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Recent developments on the funding side which may foster the integration of the European mortgage capital market Recent developments on the funding side indicate the ability of the mortgage capital market to innovate and find ways to bypass existing regulatory, legal and tax hurdles to a further harmonisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Covered bonds and RMBS markets have grown steadily over the last few years, and today each market has spanned almost all EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Growth in the covered bond market has been driven by countries such as ES, FR, AT and, recently the UK.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.01,0)">As a result, the German share of the market fell for the first time below 50% in 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Issuance is set to surge further in the next few years, as new jurisdictions enter the market, such as FI, IE, and PT.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Other countries   have covered bond legislation in the pipeline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">RMBS issuance has seen growth rates of 50% and more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">The UK continues to produce the large share, but countries like ES, IT and NL are playing an equal part in the market’s growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.43,0)">At the same time, boundaries between covered bonds and RMBS have got blurred and the two instrument types have started to converge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The most obvious example in this respect is the launch of the first covered bond in the UK, a market traditionally dominated by RMBS, in July 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">This deal, issued by HBOS, was structured with the help of securitisation techniques, and succeeded in being accepted by the market as a covered bond even though the UK has no national covered bond legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The huge interest this innovative transaction received not only from lenders in the UK, but across Europe, demonstrates that there is a trend towards more homogenous funding instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">By using securitisation techniques, structured covered bonds may provide the necessary tools to level off legislative differences and to produce comparable covered bonds across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.14,0)">A number of global forces seem to be at work, triggering those market innovations on the funding side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Firstly, there is a strong demand from foreign investors, in particular from Asia, for European mortgage capital market instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The huge variety of European covered bonds and RMBS presents them with a great challenge to determine which structures are best, and to achieve geographical diversification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Their demand for better comparability is apparently pushing the market for more standardisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Secondly, rating agencies, which rate mortgage capital market instruments across countries, play an important role in setting market standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Thirdly, the eroding deposit base forces lenders to diversify their funding sources, and accelerates the trend towards disintermediation and securitisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Fourthly, Basel II is changing the attractiveness of RMBS relative to covered bond as an instrument to achieve regulatory capital relief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">The policy stance of the ECB towards the further integration of mortgage capital markets Since the current fragmentation comes at a cost and denies this capital market segment the benefits of a hugely sized market, it is in the interest of the ECB to support progress on this front.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">In my view, two routes need to be followed in parallel: Firstly, legislative action is needed to remove obstacles that prevent mortgage products to be offered across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.2,0)">Despite recent positive developments, the capital market for housing finance cannot become fully standardized and integrated, as long as national obstacles are not addressed – such as the difficulty of transfer of title in Germany, or differing definitions of mortgage default even within individual countries such as in Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">In this context, the ECB strongly supports the initiative of the European Commission’s Forum Group on Mortgage Credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">This initiative aims, in a first step, at identifying current major obstacles to further integration in domestic tax, legal and consumer protection frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">In a second step, the Commission will launch a cost benefit study that will be followed by a proposal for legislative action to improve the integration of primary and secondary mortgage markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Secondly, the contribution of the private sector to the standardisation of financial instruments used to fund mortgages is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The ECB strongly believes that market forces play a key role in finding efficient and effective ways to fully exploit the opportunities offered by a more integrated capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Therefore the ECB welcomes very much the initiative of the European Mortgage Federation to launch a European Covered Bond Council   with the aim of better meeting the requirements of covered bond market participants and to create a platform for exchange of information and discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Concluding remarks I strongly believe that market led initiatives like today’s conference are vital to make further progress in integrating the funding instruments for mortgages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">As the US experience has shown, a more integrated market on the funding side will also help to promote the standardisation of the market for underlying mortgage products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">The ECB will follow your initiative with great interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">And we are willing to engage in an open dialogue with the industry on the most efficient and effective ways to overcome existing hurdles to further integration of the European mortgage markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">I wish you two very interesting days of discussion and hope that your exchange of views will help the European mortgage market to make a further step towards integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
