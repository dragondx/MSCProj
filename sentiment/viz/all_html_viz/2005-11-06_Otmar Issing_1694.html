    <h3> Speaker: Otmar Issing </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.23,0)"> Mario Monti.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">A tribute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Speech by Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB6 November 2005 The message of Hayek’s opus magnum “Constitution of Liberty” is contained in the titles of its first two parts: “The Value of Freedom” and “Freedom and the Law”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.45,0)">Two principles characterise a free society: limits on the power of the state and the rule of law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Hayek’s main objective is that the coercion of some in society by others is reduced to the extent possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">“This state we shall describe throughout as a state of liberty or freedom,” he says  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In his chapter on the origins of the rule of law he quotes John Locke: “The end of the law is, not to abolish or restrain, but to preserve and enlarge freedom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.22,0)">For in all the states of created beings capable of laws, where there is no law there is no freedom”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is obvious that only a free market economy is consistent with a free society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Only within such a framework can people act as free individuals and make the best contribution to their own well-being and that of others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Competition is a fundamental element of a market economy and the driving force of the progress of mankind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.39,0)">In “Competition as a discovery procedure” Hayek says that “… wherever the use of competition can be rationally justified, it is on the ground that we do not know in advance the facts that determine the actions of competitors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.43,0)">In sports or in examinations, no less than in the award of government contracts or of prizes for poetry, it would clearly be pointless to arrange for competition, if we were certain beforehand who would do best… I propose to consider competition as a procedure for the discovery of such facts as, without resort to it, would not be known to anyone, or at least would not be utilised”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We honour today a man who has lived up to these principles in word and deed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This has been most visible in his role as the most respected Commissioner in Brussels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">His first responsibility was for Internal Market, Financial Services and Financial Integration  ; his second for Competition  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.91,0)">His decisions were landmarks in important sectors of the European economy – the German banking sector was just one of many spectacular cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">As Commissioner he was able to realise what an economist of his calibre and a man of independent mind and character would see as the fulfilment of his professional life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">His actions reflected a rare combination of personal integrity, a sharp intellect and a broad and deep understanding of economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">His reasoning was always compelling and convincing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.96,0)">“Brussels”, a word which for many has negative connotations, was – when represented by his persona – universally respected, and feared by all those who might not, to put it mildly, have a preference for competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.15,0)">CEOs of the biggest companies in the world, starting sometimes from a position of arrogance, were ultimately obliged to accept not only his decisions in favour of competition but also the superiority of his arguments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.36,0)">As a European antitrust attorney once said: “Monti is not the type to bow down to any verbal aggression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">He may have an academic exterior, but there is steel inside”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.82,0)">Or as a lobbyist once put it: “Monti is not a politician.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">He is an intellectual, an absolutely honest economist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">He has an extremely charming way of sending you out to the desert.” Among politicians as well as the general public he is respectfully known as “il professore”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I could easily continue with compliments on “Super Mario”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">For me, he is an outstanding example of an economist who is as much esteemed among academics as he is among politicians, the business community and the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">You will not be surprised to hear me say that we need much more involvement of academics in public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Mario Monti demonstrates that to be successful in this respect one need not compromise on intellectual honesty – just the opposite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">He is the personification of political economics in the great liberal tradition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Just to give an example in his own words: “Cartels are cancers on the open market economy, which forms the very basis of our Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.07,0)">… Moreover, since by nature cartels are secret and therefore difficult to uncover, it is likely that what we are seeing is only the tip of the iceberg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.72,0)">In the words of Adam Smith there is a ‘tendency for competitors to conspire’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">… I am determined to strengthen our fight against cartels”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Mario Monti was an eloquent advocate of free markets long before he took the position in Brussels which made him well known worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">For him, there can be no lasting economic well-being without free markets, and that free markets are a prerequisite for a free and democratic society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">A true zoon politicon in the sense of Aristotle, he was a tireless and vocal contributor to Italian public life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">He waged a constant fight against all kinds of unnecessary regulations and restrictions, while remaining firm in the belief that a free society and a functioning market economy need a well designed framework establishing the rule of law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I will not forget the day I delivered a speech at the famous Bocconi University, where Mario has been president for many years now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Afterwards, we embarked on a discussion of the future of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">At that time in the early 1990s he was convinced that Italy needed constraints on its politics to start a virtuous circle which would ultimately allow participation in Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Such a framework in his opinion could only come from outside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">His ideas were – and I think still are – very close to what Germans have in mind when they speak of “Ordnungspolitik”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Indeed, listening to him you might think he is more German than most Germans are today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We should invite him to tell Germany what it has to change to find back to its way to prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Today is not the occasion to examine Mario Monti’s career in detail and analyse his numerous publications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As a central banker, though, I have to mention that he started as an expert in the field of monetary economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">He believed that a clear assignment of responsibilities was needed for the optimal conduct of economic policies; for the central bank, the goal could only be price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.48,0)">Many of his ideas initially faced fierce opposition even from within circles which later supported him.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">His influence on public opinion in Italy cannot be overestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This is also due to his impact as an academic teacher on a generation of students.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I have learned from students of his – some of them now at the European Central Bank – that at a time when Italian universities were dominated by mainstream Keynesianism, Mario Monti’s reading list included Milton Friedman and Allan Meltzer and the disequilibrium theorists, such as Clower and Leijonhufvud, alongside with James Tobin, his teacher at Yale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Today, some of Italy’s most prominent academics represent the kind of political economics for which Mario Monti stands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Mario Monti’s influence on politics is now needed more than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">I think we all appreciate the fact that he took on a new and important European responsibility in becoming Chairman of the Board of Bruegel – “Brussels European and Global Economic Laboratory”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">He was quoted as having said the new think tank would bring much-needed new thinking to the role of Europe in international economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The name “Bruegel” was chosen not simply for being a clever acronym but also because Pieter Bruegel was a leading exponent of the painting of movement, not to mention market activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Mario Monti’s work and personal achievements have been recognised by a number of awards, of which I have time to mention only a few.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In 2001 he received the Benemeriti della Scienza e della Cultura medal as well as the Wolfram Engels Prize awarded by the Stiftung Marktwirtschaft and the informedia-Stiftung.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In 2004 he was awarded the Robert Schuman Medal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">But his life, his work and his personality could not be better characterised and recognised than by a prize named after the great economist and philosopher of market and liberty Friedrich August von Hayek.</span>
