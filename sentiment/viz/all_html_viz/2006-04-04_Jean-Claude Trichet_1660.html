    <span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)"> Issues related to central counterparty clearing Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat the joint European Central Bank - Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago conference4 April 2006 Dear Ladies and Gentlemen, I have the pleasure to conclude a very successful conference, a conference that has been special in many respects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">First, this conference was jointly organised by the European Central Bank   and the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">As such, it marks another fruitful example of cooperation among central banks across the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Second, it has featured research on central counterparties  , a topic that has not yet received a great deal of attention from academic researchers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">I hope that this conference has contributed to stimulating more research on this very important subject.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Finally, it has brought together market participants, public authorities and academics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">I am in no doubt that discussions involving people from these very different groups are beneficial for all of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.65,0)">However, I am also aware that it is not always easy to initiate such discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This conference has also been very successful in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">I wish to thank the organizers of this conference at the FRBC and the ECB for all their hard work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Central counterparties play an important role in many financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.27,0)">They interpose themselves between the buyer and the seller of financial assets, acting as the buyer to every seller and as the seller to every buyer of a specified set of contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.66,0)">This process mitigates counterparty credit risk, which is the risk that one party of a trade suffers losses because the other party cannot fulfil its obligations from the trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Through multilateral netting, central counterparties enhance liquidity and reduce liquidity costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Finally, central counterparties ensure post-trade anonymity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Central banks are interested in the smooth functioning of central counterparties for three reasons: central counterparties can enhance financial stability as long as they function smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.07,0)">The failure of a central counterparty however can significantly destabilise financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">It is therefore important that central counterparties have appropriate risk management procedures in place; links between central counterparties operating in different countries can foster financial integration across those countries, by allowing the participants to trade in a foreign market and clearing that trade through existing national arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Links between CCPs can take a variety of forms, ranging from the establishing of direct relations between two CCPs to arrangements between central counterparties which allow their participants to mitigate the costs associated with risk control measures  ; central counterparties use payment systems and other infrastructures operated by central banks to carry out their activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">For these reasons, central banks closely follow and contribute to the discussions related to central counterparty clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This conference is an important element in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me now outline a few central points of this discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Central counterparties must have adequate risk management procedures .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Central counterparties play a systemically important role in many financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.63,0)">The failure of a central counterparty can severely disrupt financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.76,0)">Central counterparties are highly specialised in managing risks and failures have been rare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Nevertheless, there is no room for complacency, and any efforts to improve risk management methods are most welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">As mentioned already several times in this conference, in November 2004 the G-10 central banks and the IOSCO issued a report which set out 15 comprehensive international recommendations for promoting the safety and efficiency of central counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The ESCB-CESR working group is working in close co-operation with EU CCPs to adapt these recommendations to the European context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Academic research can provide additional hints on the specific situations which are targeted by the recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This has been shown at this conference by Alejandro García and Ramo Gençay or John Cotter and Kevin Dowd with their approaches to extreme market events, and by Froukelien Wendt in her survey on intraday margining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The governance structure of central counterparties should in principle be market driven.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The governance structure may have a significant influence on, for example, risk management and other strategic decisions of central counterparties, as pointed out by Thorsten Koeppl and Cyril Monnet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Although the optimal governance structure cannot be defined ex-ante, the markets may in many cases be in a good position to identify and produce it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.35,0)">Public authorities must, however, step in whenever market failures become significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">In this respect, the ECB supports the views expressed in the CPSS-IOSCO recommendations according to which governance arrangements for a CCP should be clear and transparent in order to fulfil public interest requirements, support the objectives of owners and participants and, in particular, promote the effectiveness of a CCP’s risk management procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The features of post-trading structure should also in principle be market driven.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">We are witnessing fast developments in the field of financial market infrastructures, especially in Europe, but also in other parts of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.96,0)">With respect to central counterparties, I would like to mention four major developments: a) Consolidation of central counterparties Since the start of EMU, the number of central counterparties for financial instruments has fallen from 14 to 7 in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This process of consolidation may have a positive impact on financial stability as larger central counterparties may find it easier to diversify risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">It may also have a positive impact on the efficiency of post-trading arrangements due to network effects and issues related to interoperability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.42,0)">However, the failure of large central counterparties could have an even more disastrous impact on financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.56,0)">Moreover, consolidation may eventually lead to a reduction in competitive pressures with a negative impact on efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The Eurosystem has formulated this position in a policy statement on consolidation in central counterparty clearing, which was published as early as September 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">As stated in the policy statement, the ECB supports any form of market-led integration or consolidation process that fulfils the ECB’s requirements in terms of financial stability, open access, price transparency and efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">b) Expansion of activities of central counterparties While in the past, most European central counterparties only cleared derivatives, many of them also now clear securities transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.69,0)">The effects of such an expanssion have been differently assessed by different speakers at this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">On the one hand, John Jackson and Mark Manning found that central counterparties that diversify their activities across imperfectly correlated assets may often be able to better manage their risks than single-product clearers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">At the same time, securities market participants benefit as their exposure to counterparty credit risk is reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This trend towards multi-product central counterparties could therefore be beneficial from a financial stability perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">On the other hand, Diana Chan mentioned in the first panel yesterday, that central counterparts that diversify their activities across imperfectly correlated assets and reduce the collateral requirements for their participants by offsetting margins related to these different activities could.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.72,0)">significantly underestimate risk exposure and collateralisation requirements, thereby create additional and unknown risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">These developments need therefore to be carefully observed by market participants and relevant authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.61,0)">c) Creation and dismantling of vertical “silos” In Europe, vertical silos encompassing trading, clearing and settlement infrastructures have been created, while other silos have been dismantled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The discussion on which structure is preferable is ongoing, and the answer may be different for different markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">While silos may help infrastructure providers to reduce operating costs and to better coordinate the prices of the different integrated services  , they may reduce competition when they are misused, for example, to favour a central counterparty in the silo over its competitors outside of the silo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">As the Eurosystem explained in its policy statement of September 2001, the disadvantages of vertical silos “can be overcome provided that customers can choose between systems along the value chain  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It is therefore crucial that access to essential facilities, whether vertically integrated or not, should not be unfairly impeded.” d) Growing need for adequate infrastructure in the field of credit derivatives     As mentioned by Governor Kroszner, enhancing the post-trading infrastructure does not automatically mean to introduce telles quelles the same techniques that CCPs use in exchanged-traded derivatives but rather to identify the solutions which are equally effective and take into account the different features of OTC markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">All these developments refer to the market structure that surrounds central counterparties and are highly relevant for the interests of central banks in the fields of financial stability and financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">As central banks, we believe that the market structure should be market driven as long as market failures are not observed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.85,0)">Significant market failures however must be identified and in many cases require appropriate public intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.44,0)">This brings me to my last point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.83,0)">What is the role of public authorities and, in particular, central banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Market forces need a sound legal, regulatory and oversight basis to work efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In the euro area with its 12 countries, and in the European Union with its 25 countries, the creation of such a sound basis requires first and foremost a certain degree of harmonisation of public principles and standards across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Efforts in this direction are ongoing and the Eurosystem provides active support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Here I should mention the joint work by the European System of Central Banks and the Commission of European Securities Regulators towards establishing standards for securities clearing and settlement in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">As indicated in the ECB policy statement of 2001, standards are to be carefully set and then implemented by public authorities with a clear interest and expertise in the respective field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">It appears evident that the Eurosystem, for example, should be involved in the oversight of any major infrastructure for euro-denominated assets with a view to being able to properly address serious threatens to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">A paper, authored by a Professor at the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University in 1990, addressing the performance of the derivatives clearing and settlement systems during the 1987 stock market break, concluded, inter alia, that “the Federal Reserve played a vital job in protecting the integrity of the clearing and settlement systems.” The name of that Professor is Ben Bernanke.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Finally, it is important that cross-fertilisation of experiences and expertise of market participants, academics and public authorities in this field continues and, as I said before, this conference has certainly contributed in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">With this, I thank you very much for your attention, close the conference and wish you a pleasant journey home.</span>
