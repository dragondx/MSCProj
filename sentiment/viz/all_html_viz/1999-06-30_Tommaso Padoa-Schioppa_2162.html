    <span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)"> Reflections on the globalisation and europeanisation of the economy Lecture by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, University of Göttingen, Center for Globalization and Europeanization of the Economy, Göttingen, 30 June 1999 Minister, President, Dean, Ladies and Gentlemen It is a great honour for me to be here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.11,0)">At the same time, it is intimidating to speak under the portraits of such prominent persons and in front of such a distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">I take the invitation to speak here today as a sign of attention that this University and the Centre itself pay to an important recent event in the field of interest of the new Centre: the creation of the European Central Bank and the birth of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">INTRODUCTION The establishment of a common currency and a common central bank for a group of countries which have retained their sovereignty in so many other important policy fields is indeed a major event in the global and European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It is a totally new experiment not only in economic relations, but also, I might add, in human relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">I am personally sensitive to this aspect, not only because I have firmly believed, since the early eighties, that this was a possible and desirable objective, but also because I now find myself taking part in the actual launch of this challenging and momentous project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">I have participated with particular drive in the debate and the events which have led to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Also, I have followed with special attention the active role your country, Germany, and your central bank, the Bundesbank, have played in this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I think I am aware of how much it means to the Federal Republic of Germany to have accepted the euro as its new currency, and, if you allow me, I also am aware that people in this country find it sometimes somewhat unnatural to have, as one of their central bankers, an Italian as I am.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Our new currency unites not only economies, but also the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.75,0)">The euro is the first currency which has abandoned not only its anchor to gold, but also its anchor to the State.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For hundreds and, indeed, thousands of years, currencies have had both these anchors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.0,0)">They severed the last link to gold less than 30 years ago, and they have 'disanchored' themselves from the State only with the advent of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">To have this latter feature in a currency which, being not anchored to gold, has no intrinsic value, which is just a piece of paper has a special significance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It is so because the fact that people exchange goods and services against something which has no other value than the confidence placed in it, is - in my view - one of the most striking manifestations of the bonds which unite a society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The society with these unifying bonds is now the European society, and not only a national society: this, I think, represents a profound change in human history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.03,0)">Just a few months ago, trying to explain the advent of the euro to an Asian audience during my first official visit to Asia as the ECB Board Member in charge of international relations, I found that my audience had difficulty in understanding that the euro is not just an international arrangement or an exchange rate regime, but indeed a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In order to explain, I asked them to imagine that mainland China and Korea and Japan had decided to replace and abandon their respective national currencies and adopt a common currency called, say, the Asian.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">With this example, the audience suddenly understood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.23,0)">Since history weighs even greater in eastern Asia, where the tragedies of the past have been thought about to a much lesser degree than in Europe, a single currency between Japan and Korea is just something that one cannot consider a real possibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">We have, instead, reached this point here in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.12,0)">It took 50 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.61,0)">This, by the way, is one of the distinctions between the globalisation and the europeanisation of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I shall structure my remarks in the following way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">First, allow me just a few brief observations on what is new in globalisation and europeanisation by comparison with the development of international economic relationships in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Then I will turn to a comparison between globalisation and europeanisation, first, by indicating in what sense the two processes are parallel and, second, by highlighting where they differ.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In will finaly discuss in what sense europeanisation can serve as an example and be a relevant lesson when thinking about the process of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I shall conclude by attempting to look ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">NEW ASPECTS OF INTERNATIONALISATION It is not obvious to what extent the present internationalisation of the economy is something entirely new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">For people of my generation and also that of my father, who was born in 1911, there is certainly no previous experience of such a far-reaching degree of internationalisation as the one we have witnessed developing in the last decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.12,0)">But, for the generation of my grandparents, the judgement would have been different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the Europe of the end of the 19th century and at the beginning of this century the economy was a highly international one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The Italian public debt at the beginning of the century - after several years of economic prosperity, low inflation, and good government - was the object of a financial operation whereby it was converted into new bonds yielding lower interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">It was a voluntary exchange which was offered to the market, and the confidence at that time was strong enough to make it a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.7,0)">The governor of the Bank of Italy at the time lived in Paris for several months in order to conduct this operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.92,0)">Paris was the financial centre where the Italian public debt was actually traded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This anecdote illustrates the extent to which the world, or at least Europe, was one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In what sense, then, do we have a new dimension of globalisation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let's start by giving some brief indications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The rate of growth of world, and also of intra-European, trade over the past decades has been consistently higher than - and frequently twice as high as - the growth of national products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">The difference between the two growth rates gives a clear indication of the extent to which the integration among economies is advancing much faster than the natural process of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Another indication is that globalisation and integration do not take only the form that we have known for centuries, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">the form of trade relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.88,0)">There is also a rising internationalisation in production, which make it increasingly difficult to say where a product has been manufactured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">A telling example is a quarrel developing in my country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Italy imports raw scarves from China, 'raw' in the sense that they have not yet been printed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The scarves are printed in Como, which is famous for silk-printing of the highest quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In fact, most of the scarves produced around the world are printed there, even if they are sold under brand names that are not Italian.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.06,0)">What should be written on the scarf?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.23,0)">Made in China, or made in Italy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.77,0)">Italian exporters would like to write "made in Como", not even "made in Italy".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.42,0)">It is difficult to say where the value comes from.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Of course, the same can be said of a car, of a computer, a laptop and a camera.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">There is clearly a globalisation in production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Thirdly, we are witnessing a globalisation in finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It hardly needs any explanation, but it is clear that the relationship between savings and investments is increasingly a world-wide one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.28,0)">The markets where debt is traded tend to behave like parts of a single market which simply moves around the clock, from one trading place to another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">This is also giving rise to a new relationship between markets, policies and governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Increasingly we are seeing that, via the market mechanism, governments themselves are subject to the judgement and the quotation of the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The market may be the expression of a global population of savers or traders which in no way coincides, or coincides only to a very small extent, with the national population of voters for governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">So there are a dual constituency, a double accountability, and this is a sign of the fact that finance has become global, but there is no global government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In conclusion, it is not inappropriate to have invented a new word such as 'globalisation' - albeit not a very elegant one - to indicate the manner in which international economic integration is developing today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">THREE PROPOSITIONS Let me now turn to a comparison between European and global developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In many ways these two processes have proceeded in parallel over the second part of this century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">For both of them, the seeds were sown in the 1940s, while the Second World War was still raging, or immediately afterwards, in the effort to rebuild the countries destroyed by the war.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.85,0)">In both cases, not only the seeds can be chronologically traced to the period before the end of the war, they were also put in place by the very experience of the war itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.11,0)">The Bretton Woods Agreement dates back to 1944, the San Francisco Conference which laid the foundations for the establishment of the United Nations was held in the early forties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The first design of a new comprehensive global economic system can also be traced back to the early 1940s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In Europe, in many places and in many countries, including this one, the early 1940s were already a time in which people - maybe only a few, but certainly people who were going to have a decisive impact on subsequent history - thought about the need to work for reconciliation among the countries which had fought two world wars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.29,0)">In my own country the federalist movement was founded in 1941 by persons who were imprisoned for their opposition to the dictatorship of the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Reading the letters of Helmut von Moltke, one finds clear indications of what the future role of Europe should be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The same can be found in France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">So the seeds were sown in the 1940s both for the attempt to build a united world and for the attempt to build a united Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">By the early 1950s most ingredients of these two parallel processes were in place: the Bretton Woods system, the United Nations, the Coal and Steel Community, which formed the embryo for the subsequent development of European institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Beyond these events which mark parallel development, I think the comparison between global and European developments can be made with respect to a certain number of economic propositions which facilitate the understanding of both of them; I will touch upon three such propositions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The first concerns the interrelationship between trade relations, capital mobility, exchange rate arrangements, and monetary policy or, on a broader level, macroeconomic policy relationships.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.95,0)">The second concerns the functions of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.42,0)">The third concerns the broader functions of economic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Allow me briefly to touch upon each of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.97,0)">Free trade, mobility of capital, stability of exchange rates, and national independence in the conduct of monetary policy constitute a set of mutually inconsistent elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">One can look at the whole development of both global and European monetary and trade relations in the light of the relationship between these four elements and the attempts to resolve the inconsistency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The Bretton Woods system was a fixed but adjustable exchange rate regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It was designed to support the development of international trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It did not encourage the free mobility of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.26,0)">Restrictions to capital movements were in fact actively encouraged by the Bretton Woods doctrine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">National monetary policies were formally autonomous, but the US dollar was the anchor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.04,0)">As capital mobility grew - not least as a result of trade developments - the Bretton Woods systems started to come under strain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">To cut a long story short, the subsequent development revealed that a complete liberalisation of capital movements without abandonment of autonomy of national monetary policies could only lead to abandoning the adjustable peg system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.41,0)">There is no clear sign that the world will move away from the present configuration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.43,0)">Despite some recent talk about restricting capital mobility, it is very difficult to imagine that capital flows could in any way be prevented or prohibited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.25,0)">This is basically an acknowledgement of the fact that there is no means for doing so without compromising allocation efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The determination of the exchange rate has been handed over to the market, and in this way national autonomy of monetary policy has been regained or preserved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">If we now turn from global to European developments and look at them in the light of the inconsistency between the aforementioned four elements, we see that the European path was different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It started with the Bretton Woods system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It went through the adoption of a treaty, namely the 1957 Treaty of Rome, which explicitly refers to the mobility of capital as one of the four freedoms forming the pillars of the European Common Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.35,0)">For many years that freedom was not implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Only at the end of the 1980s capital mobility was fully incorporated in the Single Market framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Before then only this country enjoyed full mobility of capital; not France, not Italy, not Belgium, with the United Kingdom only starting in 1979.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The Treaty of Rome was drafted on the implicit assumption that there was a fixed exchange rate regime  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.89,0)">This is why the Single Market has not complemented a monetary system of its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.18,0)">However, as the factors which led to the collapse of the Bretton Wood system started to weaken, exchange rate relationships within the European Community, the path followed in Europe was not identical to that followed by the world as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In essence, the European countries moved from a dollar standard to a Deutsche Mark standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">One can see the developments between 1971 and 1991, the point at which the negotiations for a monetary union were completed in Maastricht, as a 20-year period of a D-Mark standard in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.39,0)">It started with the so-called "Snake".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.25,0)">The Snake was soon reduced to a link to the D-Mark maintained only by small open economies such as Belgium or the Netherlands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In 1979 it was transformed into the European Monetary System   joined by two large countries, France and Italy; joined the system; Italy with a wider fluctuation band.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.22,0)">Throughout the 1980s the system grew and, like all exchange rate regimes of this kind, the structural features sustaining its proper functioning were gradually eroded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This can be explained partly by the system's increasing rigidity, partly by the policy dilemma created by German unification and, most importantly - I believe - by the greater role of capital mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In the 1970s and 1980s the D-Mark-based system was protected by limited capital mobility, just as the Bretton Woods system had been protected by limited capital mobility in the 1950s and 1960s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.97,0)">What did Europe do when capital mobility created a contradiction in the system?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Instead of taking the floating option that would reconcile the four elements of the quartet by letting the exchange rate be determined by the market and monetary policy be determined nationally, Europe took the opposite option - the single currency option, namely "one currency - one central bank".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It seems to me that the proposition concerning the inconsistency between the four elements provides a very interesting example against which we can assess, both the developments of global relationships and relations within Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.31,0)">10.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">A similar set of observations could be formulated with respect to the function of central banks, and I shall be briefer on this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Modern central banks originate from a revolution in the technology of payments, the shift from a commodity currency to a paper currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It is because a paper currency has no intrinsic value that an institution is needed to preserve the public's confidence in the currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In my view, this is the fundamental feature upon which modern central banks were founded some 150 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.21,0)">Monetary policy came later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.53,0)">No one spoke of monetary policy in the modern sense of the word in the 19th century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As the currency regime after moving from gold to paper, also moved from paper to bank deposits and the transfer of bank deposits via checks and giros became the key method of payments, it became important to control the banking system in order to ensure that banks' liabilities - which gradually became the bulk of the total amount of money in the economy - would preserve their value just like paper currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">For commercial bank liabilities to preserve their value, it is not only the total quantity of money which is important, but also the soundness of the issuing commercial bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.76,0)">This identifies, in my view, the triadic nature of modern central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.38,0)">The central bank is necessarily involved in three areas, all crucial for the security of money  : the payments system, monetary policy, the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.53,0)">This third element is not organised in the same way in every country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.62,0)">In Germany, for example, there is a separate agency for controlling the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">However, even in countries where there is a separate agency for banking supervision, the central bank is heavily involved in assessing the state of health of the banking industry, in which it plays a major role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Let us now look at this paradigm from the point of view of international relations at the global and European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">As to the former we see that the process of globalisation has gradually extended international policy cooperation over all these three central banking functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.2,0)">First, there was the Bretton Wood system, which was basically concerned with monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It was only much later that increased international co-operation in the fields of banking supervision and payment systems was established: in the mid-1970s, with the establishment of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision; and, later still, with international co-operation on payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Turning to Europe, we have witnessed the same development, but in a deeper way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Today we have a single body of banking legislation for the whole of Europe, a single central bank and a single function of overseeing the payment system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">For some time, European co-operation lagged behind global co-operation in the two latter fields, but once it started, it went much further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The Eurosystem has unified all of the three functions which were traditional functions of central banks to a far greater degree than has been accomplished at the global level - despite the fact that the process of international co-operation in this field   started much earlier than in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.47,0)">11.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A third proposition, which is worth examining from the point of view of the two parallel paths, is derived from a classic taxonomy of the policy functions proposed by Richard Musgrave in the 1940s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In his presentation of fiscal policy or, should I say, broader economic policy, he identified three functions: the achievement of macroeconomic equilibrium in the economy, the pursuit of allocation efficiency, and the exercise of a redistribution function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">According to Musgrave, public budgets play a role in each of these three fields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The three values, or goods, underlying the three policy objectives corresponding to these three functions are stability, efficiency and equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We may examine European and global arrangements from the point of view of this triad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The essence of Musgrave's argument is that economic policy demands the pursuit of all the three objectives and requires some role to be played by the State in each of the three fields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Insofar as the globalisation, on the one hand, and the europeanisation of the economy, on the other, have developed the need for a public policy, we can identify the three functions also in international and European arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.25,0)">At the global level, the International Monetary Fund   is the institution which presides over the stabilisation policies, while the former General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs  , then the various trade rounds, and now the World Trade Organisation  , have presided over the allocation function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">Finally, the various mechanisms centred around the World Bank preside over redistribution functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The same triad can be found in European arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">They are, of course, the allocation function, as the Single Market was designed as a project for a more efficient allocation of resources in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But since the very beginning, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">from the establishment of the Coal and Steel Community, the founders of the European system felt that an increase in allocation responsibilities at the European level required also to focus on both stability and equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">As regards equity, soon after the Single European Act was signed  , the doubling of the so-called structural funds in February 1988 created a new basis for the Community's policies to develop the economically weaker regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">As regards stability, the establishment of the Delors Committee in June of the same year initiated the process of monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The latest and foremost example of this is the manner in which the idea of European Union has gained strength from the project of completing the Single Market which was launched in the early 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.68,0)">PARALLELISM AND DIFFERENCES 12.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There are no doubt ways in which the parallelism, or lack thereof, between globalisation and europeanisation can be examined, but I think the aforementioned three are most striking examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.19,0)">They prompt the following two observations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The first is that the three propositions mentioned earlier, though they are not theorems, provide us with a useful insight into the way in which economic orders have developed up to the present day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The historical experience of these two parallel processes offers an interesting confirmation of the validity of the three propositions, precisely because they were not formulated with these experiences in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">However, while they help to explain some of the events of the past, they also render intelligible why, at some point in European post-war history, the idea of a single currency once again gained ground.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">They help understanding why the European institutions - which are a meeting place for politicians who may not be directly aware of these economic propositions - produce decisions which are in some ways consistent with these schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The second and perhaps more important consideration is that the developments in the second half of the century in both areas, globalisation and europeanisation, can be seen as a process whereby domestic economic solutions have increasingly been applied to the international economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.33,0)">By integrating economies, both globalisation and europeanisation have also imposed policy-making roles and/or arrangements on some of the institutions, which, according to our textbooks, were typical of the domestic rather than the international economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.42,0)">13.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The processes of globalisation and europeanisation have not proceeded in parallel in every respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It is therefore necessary to explain in what sense europeanisation is, compared to globalisation, a more innovative and a more far-reaching demonstration of what human beings can do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.22,0)">A general point must be recalled before going into anything specific.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.73,0)">This point is that Europe has generated the greatest tragedies of the first half of the century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.4,0)">On the one hand, it has witnessed the sheer disruption which hostile relations between countries can entail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">On the other hand, the second half of the century has yielded an example, this time on the positive side, of reconciliation and common statesmanship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.06,0)">Europe has thus experienced two extremes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">That said, I should like to draw attention to three ways in which the European experience goes much further than any modern human experience in creating a legal and strongly based framework for peaceful and fruitful relations among countries and people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In this sense it may be considered an interesting model for world relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">First, europeanisation does not simply mean a development of the market side of international integration, but also implies a development of the policy side of international relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Second, the strong role played by institutions in the European process compared with the world process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And third, the example which Europe provides of a multi-tier, or federally structured, system of governing the economy, in which regional arrangements contribute to the improvement of international relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Allow me to address briefly these points one by one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.37,0)">14.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">First, developing the policy side along with the market side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">We all know, of course, that a market economy needs the Rule of law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">It needs a strong set of public arrangements in order to function effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.49,0)">This has been known since the early economic writings of the founders of economics as a science.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It is a well-known fact that a market economy is a social system and not only an economic one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In fact, the most recent indication of that is the way in which the so-called transition economies are emerging from the experience of attempting socialism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.8,0)">Establishing the legal and institutional order which a market economy needs is proving to be a most difficult task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Now the European experience is one in which the policy and the market sides have been developed together and in a rather balanced way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">The evolving single market could only create the desired incentives by developing in parallel the legal and institutional infrastructure which normally exists for a national market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This implied common legislation and regulations, law enforcement mechanisms, decision-making capacities and majority voting rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">It was only by broadening the scope of majority voting and establishing a closer link between this rule-making function and the democratic process that the Single Market was finally achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Examples are provided in many fields: banking, the liberalisation of the market for public utilities, competition policy, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.47,0)">15.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.12,0)">Second, the role of institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Within a nation-state we know perfectly well that the policy function cannot rely exclusively on rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There is, and there must be, always room for exercising discretion, sometimes broader sometimes narrower, depending on the circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In recent years, most economic thinking has come to advocate a narrowing of discretion, but not its total suppression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.6,0)">No-one would argue that the law does not need interpretation or that the central bank, even if it has a rule, can dispense with deciding whether the interest rate should be changed or not, whether this should be done this week, or next week, or in three months from now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">To exercise discretion institutions are indispensable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.7,0)">Institutions could in theory be regarded as superfluous if there were only rules which do not leave any room for discretion in their interpretation or implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.35,0)">However, while national systems normally had an excess of discretion and their policy-making has moved from discretion towards rules, at the international level we have a lack of discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.55,0)">This is because we lack the institutions to which the exercise of discretionary power is entrusted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.98,0)">This lack, in turn, is due to a reluctance to confer sovereignty upon institutions which are above the nation state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">If we now look at economic policy from the angle of "rules versus discretion" and/or "rules versus institutions", the European experience provides a significant example of the capacity for institution building and for creating possibilities to exercise discretion at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">In other words, in Europe we have created a capacity to cope with the phenomenon of internationalisation at the European level which the world community has not achieved to a comparable degree.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In my view this is a major lesson which can be learned from the European experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.97,0)">Without a degree of supra-nationality, without the same decision-making efficiency which is normally granted to national powers, the policy side of the internationalisation of the economy cannot function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">It will not come as a surprise to you that I mention the European Central Bank and European System of Central Banks as the most advanced example and experience in this field today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">To be in a central bank which takes decisions on the basis of a "one person, one vote" rule is an astonishing sign of the extent to which this strengthening of supranational institutions has been accepted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.27,0)">"One person, one vote" means that the discussions about monetary policy in Europe are conducted, and actions are decided, by persons and not by countries or institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.87,0)">Just as it used to happen at the national level and as it happens in the US or the UK.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.19,0)">16.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Third, economic federalism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The European experience is more advanced than the globalisation process because the European Union provides for a system in which public policy functions relating to economic life are distributed among different levels of government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.15,0)">There are at least three, probably four, levels: the supranational   level, the national level, a sub-national or regional level - die Länder in this country - and probably the cities or municipalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.77,0)">In my country the regional level is rather weak, the municipal level is strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">From an intellectual point of view, economic federalism is a fascinating subject because it relates to the definition of the area in which a good is in fact public, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">whether it is a local public good or whether, at the other extreme, it is a world public good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is clear   that the problem of the skies  , for instance relate to a world public good, and so is the preservation of life in the oceans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Air and water are also world public goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.2,0)">However, not all public goods are public in the same sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">If, ultimately, the essence of a policy function in the economy is to pursue a public good or a public interest, and if it is true that "public" may mean different things for different communities and that the optimum is to be neither below nor above the level at which a good need to be recognised as public, then a multi-tier system of governing the economy is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">I believe Europe represents an interesting albeit complicated and still evolving human experiment in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.23,0)">V. CONCLUSION 17.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me conclude by attempting to look ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Europe is a shining example of how far it is possible and necessary to go as integration of the national economies proceed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In a way it also shows that one can go all the way in satisfying the needs of a single economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It was the idea of "sweet commerce", to use the words of Montesquieu, which was to re-unite people after religious wars via the prosaic and concrete channel of human interest, as distinct from human passions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is, in a similar vein, the idea of a single economy that was followed to re-unite the European people into a Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">However, if this path is followed through, it leads beyond pure economics into both the political and the cultural spheres.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The full implementation of a single market ultimately implies the need for political institutions which would need the necessary legitimacy to provide rules for the economy, and to satisfy the policy side of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.0,0)">And it also impinges upon areas which are more in the field of culture than in the field of economic life, such as human rights, health protection, recognition of professional qualifications, intellectual property, social systems, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In fact, it is not surprising that there is such a spillover from the economic field into the political and cultural domains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.83,0)">For a human being is one single being, and the three areas of human activity and interaction - economic, political, cultural - cannot be neatly extricated from one another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Today we are witnessing how Europe provides an example of the areas in which the gap between the economic aspect of europeanisation and the other aspects of human relations - the political and the cultural aspect - have been kept relatively narrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The European integration process has made it possible to avoid endangering some of the fundamental equilibria in society and in historical development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">At the global level there is a much wider gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">In a way, the European experience provides an example of how the global experience would - at least ideally - need to evolve in order to ensure that the huge improvement in well-being and living standards which globalisation is producing is not put at risk by insufficient developments beyond the economic fields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">I am inclined to think that it is vital that we work towards narrowing this gap, precisely in order to preserve the continuity of this very healthy process.</span>
