    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.13,0)"> Evolution or revolution?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.08,0)">The impact of a digital euro on the financial system Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a Bruegel online seminar Frankfurt am Main, 10 February 2021 Throughout history, innovations in money have challenged and altered the structure of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Time and time again, innovations have given rise to debates about the risks they pose and the rewards they bring, as well as the role of central banks in building confidence in money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Paper banknotes are a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As they were easy to carry, they made commerce more straightforward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">But their success did not come easily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.18,0)">Attempts by central banks to issue banknotes in the 17th century resulted in too many being issued and even defaults, raising questions about their effects on stability and, ultimately, on the credibility of the sovereign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Yet modern banknotes eventually enhanced the benefits of central banking for society at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.48,0)">Similar debates emerged with the rise of bank deposits in the 19th century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Advances in recording and communication technologies helped deposits become popular, consolidating the role of banks in money creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">But this also raised awareness that confidence in money depends on the stability of bank deposits, leading central banks to take on the role of lender of last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.95,0)">In today’s discussion on the digitalisation of payments, these debates sound familiar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.18,0)">Some fear that digitalisation, if not properly governed, could crowd out cash over time, create instability and even threaten monetary sovereignty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Central banks are therefore considering whether they should innovate themselves, by offering sovereign money in digital form to the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">At the ECB we are considering whether to issue – alongside euro banknotes – a digital euro: a digital form of money that, just like cash and unlike other means of payment, would be a claim on the central bank instead of a claim on a private intermediary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">But we must fully understand the economic, financial and societal implications of issuing a digital euro: we should consider how we can achieve the benefits while preserving the stability of the financial system and meeting the needs of Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.83,0)">Today, I will discuss the main effects a digital euro could have on banking intermediation, financial stability and the international financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">And I will consider some key design options that could address the risks involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.15,0)">Benefits in the context of the digitalisation of financial services The increased use of the internet, supported by rapidly growing computing power, has affected the entire economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">In the field of payments and financial services, the past decade has seen a rising number of providers and innovative technologies and products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.15,0)">At the same time, we have seen a profound shift in payment preferences, with the use of cash in retail payments declining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Even before the pandemic, one in two Europeans said they would prefer to pay digitally in a sh   , “From the payments revolution to the
