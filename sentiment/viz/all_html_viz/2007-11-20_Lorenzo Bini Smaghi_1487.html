    <h1> The value of central bank communication </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB Financial market speech series Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen permanent representation of Hessen in Brussels Brussels, 20 November 2007 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Lorenzo Bini Smaghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)"> The value of central bank communication Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBFinancial market speech series Landesbank Hessen-Thüringen permanent representation of Hessen in BrusselsBrussels, 20 November 2007  It is a great pleasure to be here tonight to speak on this special occasion since we will be discussing issues related to both economics and architecture, with one theme in common, the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">After my speech, Professor W. Prix of COOPHIMMELB AU will present the results of the planning of the new headquarters of the European Central Bank in Frankfurt, a fascinating project that will create a world landmark – the “Home of the Euro”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The ECB Values The brief for the architectural competition, dated April 2003, stated that: “ The design should reflect the values we regard as essential…We are committed to transparency, integrity, excellence and efficiency”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Prof. Prix will explain shortly how his project fulfils the main “values of the ECB”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.14,0)">However, as you will see in a few minutes, Prof. Prix deviates a bit from the competition brief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.58,0)">He totally forgets about the values of Integrity and Excellence and replaces them with two new ones which were not in the brief: Stability and Communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.77,0)">This discrepancy was evidently not considered as a sufficient reason to disqualify him from the competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">He still gets away with it, even after winning the competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I actually find it interesting to compare the two lists of values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.86,0)">It could reflect a difference between, on the one hand, the image that we, in the ECB, would like to project and, on the other hand, what people outside the ECB see as our most important values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.46,0)">Let’s start with the two values from the original competition brief that have been dropped by Prof. Prix: Integrity and Excellence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.36,0)">There are only two possible interpretations for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.26,0)">The first is that they are simply to difficult to express in architectural form and COOPHIMMELB AU dropped them hoping that nobody would notice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.27,0)">The second is that these values are so obvious for an institution like the ECB that they are simply taken as given - “Ca va sans dire”, one would say in French.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Indeed, what could one expect from the ECB if not Excellence and Integrity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I suppose we could all agree on this, so we can move to the two new values that Prof. Prix added to the list and were not in the remit: Communication and Stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let’s start with stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Stability, from our standpoint, is not a value, it’s an objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Indeed, our primary task is to achieve price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">However, if you think about it, for the people of Europe, stability – and in particular price stability – is a value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">All polls show without any doubt that in all countries of the Union people are firmly attached to price stability, and rightly complain when it is not achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Price stability might therefore be an objective for the ECB but, for the general public, it is a value that the ECB must express in all ways, including through its premises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The other value added to the list is Communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.11,0)">That’s not really a value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It’s an instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The ECB communicates its objectives, its strategy, its decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It’s a way to be accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It’s a way through which transparency is achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">How can it thus be considered as a value?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Communication is a “Value” There is no doubt that the public wants the ECB to report on what it does to ensure stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Prix to elevate Communication, to turn it into a value and make it a central part of his architectural project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I think that we - at the ECB - should take this kind of suggestion seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I would actually like to devote the rest of my speech tonight to the issue of central bank communication, in connection with the ECB’s other main values, as perceived by the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Indeed, communication is key to achieving Transparency, Accountability and Efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Why communication is essential to ensure Transparency and Accountability should be pretty obvious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">With respect to Efficiency, I would just like to point out that, in today’s world, central bank communication can be as important and effective as the traditional instrument of monetary policy, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.21,0)">the interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.63,0)">Why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.34,0)">Because inflation expectations are an important determinant of agents’ behaviour in the labour, product and capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.45,0)">By affecting agents’ expectations, central bank communication, if appropriate, can reinforce, or even replace, policy action conducted through the interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Communication is effective if it affects agents’ expectations in a desired way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">To be effective, communication has to be clear and credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.31,0)">Communication is nevertheless a difficult instrument to use, possibly even more difficult than changing the interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">There are several reasons for that and I will elaborate further on the basis of the experience of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The central bank communicates with at least three different target groups: i) financial market participants; ii) other institutional actors, in particular in the political sphere, and iii) the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The type of communication differs significantly depending on the audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.91,0)">However, such an easy distinction cannot always be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.6,0)">This is a constant challenge for policy makers, especially in an environment like the euro area, with 13 – soon 15 countries, with different cultures, languages and traditions, where even words, when translated directly, can have different meaning and provoke different reactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me analyse one by one the challenges the ECB faces in its communications with the different counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Communicating with financial markets Central bank communication is important for financial market participants because it forms the basis for their extrapolations regarding future policy actions, actions that might impact on the value of financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">The objective of the communication to this target group is to achieve at the same time efficiency and transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Central bank communication is efficient if it enables market participants to understand the monetary policy that the central bank intends to implement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.88,0)">If market participants align their expectations with what the central bank intends to do, any policy change will be significantly less disruptive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Transparency means that communication is aimed at all market participants; nobody has preferential access to information so that no market distortion occurs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">Central bank communication with financial markets is based on a fixed and a variable component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The fixed component is the definition of the price stability objective – below but close to 2% inflation over the medium term – and the analytical framework that characterises the reaction function of the central bank to the changing environment so as to achieve its objective – the so-called two-pillar strategy of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.27,0)">The variable component of central bank communication concerns the assessment of the changing economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.94,0)">This is the most delicate part because, as I mentioned previously, it affects market participants’ information set that is used to make extrapolations about interest rates and thus a whole series of asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.05,0)">Such communication presents two challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.17,0)">On the one hand, it is not always easy for market participants to distinguish between central bank communication and what I would call “noise”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.72,0)">On the other hand, central banks have to be aware that if their communication is badly interpreted, market participants may be led to make wrong decisions, with potentially large economic losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.18,0)">Ultimately, if market participants have difficulty understanding the central bank, this might undermine the credibility of the central bank itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As a consequence, central bank communication with financial markets should be based on two requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">First, market participants should be able to distinguish between information and “noise”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Second, central bankers should provide markets with information, while avoiding “noise”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">How can this be achieved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I would put forward four simple principles, which should apply in general but even more so in times of financial turbulence as those we are currently experiencing: First, central bankers should be aware that their communication can, whether they like it or not, “move the markets”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.98,0)">Second, central bankers should communicate in a way that moves the markets only on rare occasions, when there is a clear case of misalignment between market prices and expected central bank action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Third, when there is such a mis-pricing and communication is needed, it should be coordinated and occur through a single channel, coming from the institution’s top decision-making body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.95,0)">Fourth, if markets are accidentally moved, it is likely that a communication mistake was made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.15,0)">As a consequence of these four principles, markets should learn not to move in response to communications that are not explicitly designed to have that effect, in particular if they do not take place through the channel indicated in the third principle just mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.88,0)">If markets do nevertheless move under these circumstances, they do it at their own risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.96,0)">It’s not always easy for market participants to distinguish between communication relevant for them and other type of communication that central banks regularly provide, for instance with a view to their domestic audiences, which might have different tones and emphasis, as I will argue shortly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">By and large, communication between the ECB and financial markets has worked fairly well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Markets have learned over time how to distinguish between relevant communication and “noise”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.02,0)">The main source of information is the statement made by the ECB President at the start of the monthly press conference, right after the meetings of the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This communication provides a clear opportunity to explain the policy decision, the underlying assessment of economic conditions and the supporting framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Empirical analysis has shown that the Press conference helps market participants to understand the message.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.25,0)">It has occurred however at times that markets have been moved by “noise” or communication that was not intended - or should not have been intended – to move the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">On these instances, corrective communication took place in a timely fashion to eliminate the misperception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">For instance, in mid-November 2005 the President of the ECB made clear in a speech that the ECB was ready to increase interest rates two weeks later, thus aligning expectations and avoiding surprising market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In May 2006 market participants were expecting an acceleration of the pace of interest rate increase, based on scattered   rumours and “noises”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.26,0)">The ECB President advised market participants not to give importance to stories from anonymous sources or to individual statements, often made out of context, for their assessment of the future ECB policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Communication has been instrumental also in the midst of this summer market turnmoil, to help market participants distinguish between measures directly linked to the implementation of monetary policy and those aimed at restoring the proper functioning of the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In particular, the ECB indicated its intention to intervene in the money market to reduce the variability of the overnight rate as long as this is deemed necessary, including around the year-end when market participants are expecting a tightening in the demand for liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This communication has contributed to reduce the tensions in the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.11,0)">One issue which is debated by academics and market participants is whether there are limits to the amount of communication that a central bank should provide to the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.09,0)">In this context, the ECB has refused to give explicit guidance on the path of future interest rates over a horizon longer than a month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The reason is that, in our view, it is not appropriate to make firm commitments in a world of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">One could of course make conditional forecasts, based on the information available at the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Some central banks have started to do this, by announcing the future path of interest rates over a horizon of two years or more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">However, the case has still to be made that this information really benefits market participants in a consistent way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.5,0)">Since this type of announcement is conditional on the information available at a specific moment in time, it is valid only at that precise moment and bound to change shortly after.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.42,0)">Market participants will thus regularly ask the central bank whether the published forecast is still valid or not, and in the latter case in what direction it is moving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.88,0)">Under these circumstances it is not easy for a central bank to avoid such discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.92,0)">Why would it be appropriate to publish the interest rate path only three or four times a year rather than six or eight, or even monthly, or any time a policy-maker addresses an audience?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">What is more important for the proper conduct of monetary policy is that market participants have a good understanding of the analytical framework used by the central bank to conduct its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This allows market agents to make their own forecast of the interest path, based on their understanding of underlying economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.09,0)">If the central bank revealed its own forecast of interest rates, market participants might be less inclined to draw up their own forecast, which would then make it difficult for them to assess the future conduct of monetary policy, especially when that policy deviates from the forecast because of unexpected developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.74,0)">The central bank would not be in a position to assess whether inflation expectations are appropriately anchored at a level consistent with its objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Communicating with political authorities The main objective of the central bank communication with the other authorities is to ensure proper accountability, which is a prerequisite for independence, and to improve the efficiency of economic policy overall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The communication between the ECB and the political authorities takes place within a clear framework, laid down in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The ECB interacts with the European Parliament, through regular hearings by the ECB President and other members of the Executive Board on a whole range of issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The European Parliament adopts, on its own initiative, a yearly resolution on the actions implemented by the ECB, in which it explicitly comments on monetary policy and other tasks of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.54,0)">Such a report is not required by the Treaty and is not the customary practice of most other advanced countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.92,0)">The ECB and the Eurogroup interact frequently, with the President of the ECB attending the monthly Eurogroup meetings and the President of the Eurogroup joining the meetings of the ECB Governing Council whenever he can.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Discussions cover a whole range of issues, while fully respecting the independence of the institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">One issue which has been made clear from the start is that monetary and budgetary policies should be conducted autonomously, although taking into consideration all the information made available by the other policy maker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The coordination of monetary and economic policies, a concept often examined in the literature, in practice entails an exchange of information on the economic conditions underlying policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is not an exchange of pre-commitments, a tit-for-tat in order to achieve a desired common objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Indeed, the primary objective of the ECB is price stability, while other goals of economic policies, such as growth and employment, are the responsibility of the political authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.77,0)">This interpretation applies also to central banks which formally have more than one objective, like the US Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.13,0)">Alan Greenspan, in his recent book The Age of Turbulence, writes that the Fed has never committed to any interest rate move in exchange for budgetary or other policies, much to the disappointment of some Treasury Secretaries, in particular Brady under the Bush   administration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.06,0)">Although there is a clear framework within which the ECB and the European political bodies are expected to communicate, there are at times undesirable slippages in public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.28,0)">This is a peculiarity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.43,0)">In most other countries, the political authorities never communicate in public on issues related to monetary policy, even less on interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The independence of the central bank is considered as an asset and never questioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Again, Greenspan in his book explains why the US President, or the Treasury Secretary avoid commenting on interest rates, thus allowing the Federal Reserve to effectively deal with inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Beyond the reasons given by Greenspan, two others deserve mentioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.24,0)">First, a cacophony of statements on the tactics and/or strategy of monetary policy coming from different institutional actors adds unnecessary “noise” to the system, to the possible detriment of monetary policy’s overall effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.01,0)">Second, statements made by politicians may backfire, in the following sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.17,0)">History has clearly shown that statements coming from actors other than the central bank almost invariably call for a monetary policy loosening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.74,0)">Under such circumstances, the risk is that the central bank may feel inclined, for reputational reasons, to follow a marginally more hawkish stance than it would otherwise do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.56,0)">Such a possibility was effectively expressed by former ECB President Duisenberg when he quipped that “central bankers are like cream – the more you whip them, the stiffer they get”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Alan Greenspan describes his encounters with different Presidents who committed to respect the independence of the Fed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.24,0)">Robert Rubin, former Treasury Secretary, writes in his book, In An Uncertain World, how he advised President Clinton never to speak about interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">He also recounts how, in the weekly meetings with the Fed Chairman, the two never discussed monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The same approach is followed in most other advanced countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.9,0)">In the euro area, however, some people adopt quite a different attitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.56,0)">Some politicians across the political spectrum have no inhibition about advising, commenting on or even asking the ECB outright to move in one direction or the other – mainly one direction!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">- as if they knew better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.14,0)">The independence of the ECB, and its primary objective of maintaining price stability is even questioned at times, as if the Treaty could be regularly amended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.82,0)">How should central bankers respond to such remarks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Athanasios Orphanides, Governor of the Central Bank of Cyprus and, come January, a fellow member of the Governing Council of the ECB, made an exemplary comment on this matter to the Financial Times recently: “ What the founders of the ECB incorporated into its mandate is the essence of what we have learnt from monetary history in the past 100 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.19,0)">The clarity of the mandate makes it easier in my view to take the correct monetary policy decisions with much greater confidence, which allows monetary policy to best contribute to the welfare of nations.” In other, less diplomatic words, I would say that over 100 years of monetary history show that when monetary policy is left in the hands of politicians the outcome for society is worse, both in terms of inflation and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">That’s why in all advanced countries central banks are independent and have clearly stated price stability as being their overriding objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Fortunately, this has been reaffirmed in the EU’s Reform Treaty and hopefully this discussion will come to an end, at least for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.38,0)">But why do politicians in the euro area comment on interest and exchange rates, although they know that their chance of influencing the ECB is practically zero?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Well, to develop Greenspan’s reasoning, politicians who ask the ECB to move, or not to move, naturally want to be heard primarily by their domestic audiences and to be seen as influential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.86,0)">Not having influence might however undermine their credibility in the eyes of their electorate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.04,0)">So why do they persist?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.19,0)">There can be three explanations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.03,0)">I repeat: explanations, not justifications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.73,0)">The first one is that, unlike financial market participants, politicians and other social partners have difficulty in understanding the forward-looking nature of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.17,0)">In particular, they don’t always understand why monetary conditions have to be tightened on some occasions even if inflation has not increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.58,0)">“Why are you putting up interest rates if there is no inflation?” is a question that I am often asked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.13,0)">Evidently, if you wait for inflation to rise, then it will be too late and very costly to bring it down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Interest rates are increased in order to prevent inflation from rising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.41,0)">The success of recent years in keeping inflation low in the euro area might have come at a cost: economic agents, in particular politicians, may have forgotten or underestimated what it has taken to achieve this result, including increasing interest rates when needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.65,0)">The absence of a significant financial constituency in continental Europe could be a reason why - differently from other countries like the US and the UK - politicians continue to make statements about monetary policy and interest rates without being excessively penalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.49,0)">The second possible explanation is the frustration felt by politicians, who are expected to refrain from speaking on monetary policy while the ECB and the national central banks can express their views on a whole range of issues, including budgetary and structural policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.1,0)">I have to confess that I felt this frustration myself at times when I was sitting on the other side of the table, working for the Italian finance ministry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.16,0)">Is there a remedy to this asymmetry?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.89,0)">As I mentioned, allowing political bodies to speak about monetary policy would only be confusing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.66,0)">It would create uncertainty about the institutional set-up of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It is not done in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.78,0)">Should then the ECB stop talking about fiscal and structural issues?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.62,0)">I put this as a question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255.0,0)">Who would benefit from this censorship?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In continental European countries, central banks are traditionally asked to express their views on their countries’ budgetary policies, sometimes even in a formal address to parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This is considered, by some of the political authorities themselves, in particular parliament, and the public at large, as a way to get an independent assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">In Italy, for example, the central bank Governor has the role of “senior economic adviser” to the government and parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is also the experience in the US, where the Chairman of the Federal Reserve is called by Congress to express his views on specific public finance issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It seems to me that various groups in society are interested in asking the ECB and the national central banks for their views on budgetary and other issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I guess therefore that European politicians have to accept this asymmetry, as other politicians around the world have done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The third explanation is that the blame-Europe game, which includes “blame the ECB”, has been a popular one for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.39,0)">It has actually had devastating effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.93,0)">First, it has undermined people’s trust in European institutions, as the rejection of the Constitution in France and the Netherlands showed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.33,0)">Second, it has exacerbated the relationship between the various institutions themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.41,0)">The ECB is often asked why it doesn’t publish the minutes of its meetings, as other central banks do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.08,0)">It is indeed true that other central banks, like the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, do publish the minutes of their meetings and their voting records.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.62,0)">But these central banks live in institutional environments different from the ECB’s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.82,0)">As I mentioned, in these countries the political authorities do not continuously try to influence or pass judgement on monetary authorities; they, and that includes their heads of state, do not criticise the central bank, let alone individual members of the Governing Council, in public speeches, including in front of the parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.15,0)">Their parliaments do not vote on the policies of their central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.31,0)">This would be totally unheard of.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It’s a different story in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Here, the respect for the ECB’s mandate and decisions is not yet a fully established principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.3,0)">Publication of the minutes of the Governing Council meetings would be premature, at this would expose the individual members to public discussions in their own countries, while their accountability is with the whole Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The institutional framework that Europe has given itself needs to be trusted and respected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This framework stipulates not only that the ECB is independent but also that the political institutions and bodies of the European Union and the Member States “undertake to respect the principle   and not to seek to influence the members of the decision-making bodies of the ECB”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is the task of the political authorities to show the example and display that trust and respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Communicating with the public Communicating with the public has two main objectives: Efficiency and Accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.41,0)">It is, in my view, one the most challenging tasks, for a number of reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.58,0)">The first is the language issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Unlike other central banks, the ECB has to use 11 languages to speak to the 317 million people who live in the 13 euro area countries, each of which has different cultures and traditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.6,0)">In addition to the sheer quantity of languages, there is the problem of so-called “false friends”: words that look similar in different languages may have different connotations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.71,0)">For instance, the word “risk” seems to be much more neutral in Anglo-Saxon languages than in Romance languages, where it tends to have a negative meaning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.91,0)">For example, the concept of “upside risks to growth”, which is just a statistical concept related to probability distribution, sounds like contradiction in Romance languages as it combines both a positive and negative connotation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the Eurosystem, the national central banks play a key role in communicating with the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The Governors of those banks, who are members of the ECB Governing Council, pass on the common message to their national audiences and explain the policy of the ECB and how it contributes to achieving price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Communicating with the public can have an impact on agents’ behaviour, thus increasing the efficiency of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.78,0)">Such communication has to strike a balance between two rather incompatible objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">On the one hand, the central bank should raise awareness of the potential inflationary risks and warn against any behaviour that could jeopardise price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">On the other hand, it should also reassure the public that all necessary action will be taken to ensure that price stability is maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.78,0)">This requires a delicate balancing act between creating alarm about risks to inflation and being complacent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.09,0)">Any marked shift in one direction or the other may undermine the credibility of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.69,0)">Again, the appropriate balance may differ across countries and cultures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.18,0)">For instance, the German public seems to have become used to being constantly warned about inflationary risks and would interpret softer language as a weakness of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.3,0)">In other countries, however, the same words may lead to think that the central bank is somewhat “obsessed” with inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Communicating in the face of unexpected price shocks, like the rising oil and food prices we are currently experiencing, is one such “tightrope act”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.18,0)">This kind of shock affects price levels, and thus inflation, without the central bank being able to counteract it immediately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Indeed, while an increase in the price of oil or primary agricultural commodities pushes up end-prices for consumers within a few weeks, the central bank’s weapon for fighting inflationary pressures, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.66,0)">the interest rate, takes at least a year to have an effect on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.69,0)">Raising interest rates today affects inflation one year from now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.71,0)">It has no impact on today’s inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.16,0)">So what should a central bank do when faced with, say, an oil or food price shock?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.74,0)">The answer is: it depends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.91,0)">If the shock is one-off and temporary, it affects only relative prices, so there is no need for a monetary policy reaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Inflation would increase only mechanically, to account for the relative price change, and would come back to normal when the adjustment is completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">If, however, the shock triggers further reactions by wage earners and firms, who will want to pass on this increase to other costs and prices, inflation might increase on a more permanent basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Monetary policy needs tightening in this case to bring inflation back down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This solution is less efficient and more costly in terms of foregone output and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The optimal solution is that economic agents consider oil and food price increases as a once-and-for-all “tax” that cannot be offset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">How can this optimal solution be achieved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Communication is key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It has to raise awareness of the inflationary problem but without causing alarm because the shock can remain temporary and be re-absorbed if agents behave properly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.33,0)">If the central bank’s message fails to convince agents not to engage in second-round effects, the temporary inflationary pressures may become permanent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.08,0)">The central bank has then no other choice than to tighten monetary policy to counteract these pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.4,0)">Convincing agents to accept the “tax” of higher oil and food prices without compensation is not easy, and understandably so for the most vulnerable members of society who suffer most from these increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.8,0)">On the other hand, the alternative of letting inflation get a grip is much worse, as inflation hurts precisely those whose incomes are less protected, and the cost of containing inflation is higher once it has become entrenched in agents’ behaviour and expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Experience in the euro area suggests that inflation can be kept in check, even in the face of these shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.66,0)">In the last few years, the price of oil has more than quadrupled, but the impact on inflation has been temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">There have been no substantial second-round effects, and inflation has remained under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">This shows that Europe’s economy has become more flexible and that European households and firms have been able to distinguish between temporary and permanent cost pushes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It is important that this continues to be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.68,0)">It must be made clear to the public that monetary policy can only affect the general price level, not relative prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Other policies should aim to compensate for the income distribution effects of relative price changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">For instance, the constraints on agricultural production under the Common Agricultural Policy should be removed, the use of alternative sources of energy should be encouraged, and so forth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.26,0)">Another issue which has been challenging for central banks’ communication with the public at large has been the discrepancy between measured and perceived inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This, by the way, is not only a phenomenon limited to the euro area but has been experienced in many other countries, which provides further evidence that the euro is not responsible for inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">In recent months we have seen a new spike in inflation perceptions, reaching levels last seen in January 2004, coinciding with the increase in food prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.52,0)">Several studies have investigated the difference between inflation perceptions and measured inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.25,0)">One explanation is that, in a world of uncertainty, people attribute more importance to price changes that affect goods that are more frequently purchased, so-called small-ticket items like bread, milk and other diaries, and even petrol, than those like apparel and electronics whose prices have fallen but which are purchased less frequently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.34,0)">The perception of higher inflation, which is often fuelled by the media, is a concern because it affects inflation expectations and increases the likelihood of second-round effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.32,0)">It can also undermine the credibility of the central bank and its primary objective –to achieve price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is therefore essential that citizens have a correct perception of the underlying inflationary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Concluding remarks In an uncertain world, in which people face a variety of shocks and changes in the environment, communication is not only an instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is also an asset valued by the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.34,0)">Central bankers have to communicate with great care, being aware of the damage that a misunderstood message or “noise” can inflict on financial market participants, households and business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is particularly the case in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Not so much because its economy is different or subject to different shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.75,0)">The reason is that communication is more difficult in an area with cultural, historical and linguistics differences and in a political environment that is much more complex than in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.85,0)">The risk that Europe and the euro are blamed for any negative economic development is omnipresent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.96,0)">It’s a convenient scapegoat, to distract the attention of the public from internal problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">We all, not only central bankers, but also academics, politicians, government officials, journalists, at national and European level, are responsible for explaining economic developments that are affecting the millions of citizens in our countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Only in this way can they regain confidence both in themselves and in the institutions that govern their countries and Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Thank you very much.</span><span style="background-color:

Bini Smaghi, “With or without prejudice to price stability?”, speech at the Barclays annual conference, London, 24 May 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The issue has been widely examined in the literature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Blinder and others,   “How do Central Banks Talk?”, ICMB/CEPR Geneva Report on International Economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">For a more recent analysis of both conceptual and practical aspects of central banks’ communication, see for example Geerats, P.  , ‘Transparency of Monetary Policy: Theory and Practice’, CESifo Economic Studies,  94.</span>
