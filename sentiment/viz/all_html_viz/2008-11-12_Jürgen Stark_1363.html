    <h3> Speaker: Jürgen Stark </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)"> Growth and productivity of the financial sector: challenges for monetary policy Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBdelivered at High-Level BCL Policy PanelLuxembourg, 12 November 2008 Introduction I would like to thank the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg for the invitation to speak here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">It gives me great pleasure to congratulate the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg on its tenth anniversary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">It is a great honour for me to contribute to the Pierre Werner Lecture and to address such a distinguished audience on this occasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.6,0)">Depending on one’s perspective, this is either the worst or the best time to address the question of productivity in the financial sector and its implications for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I lean towards the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.9,0)">The current financial crisis is now wreaking havoc and the economic outlook is extraordinarily difficult to assess.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.4,0)">It is also a time when the market model is increasingly being questioned, not only by the usual suspects but also by a broad spectrum of economists and non-economists alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.01,0)">That the financial sector is now experiencing a negative shock is an understatement to say the least.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In some respects, the financial landscape is already rather different from only half a year ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.63,0)">What would we say if a non-financial sector were hit by a huge negative shock?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Typically, the sector in question would need to adjust itself to leaner times, often resulting in some combination of outsourcing to countries with lower costs and increased focus on automation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Low-skilled jobs would tend to become fewer, and highly skilled jobs would tend to gain in importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.87,0)">That some sectors shrink and others expand is quite normal in a dynamic market economy and there are examples of shrinking industries as well as of expanding ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.82,0)">In the short-to-medium term, I think it is a good bet that the financial services sector will shrink significantly and that the events now unfolding will change the financial landscape for years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">In the longer term, developments are more open and will be shaped not least by the policy responses under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I would like today to discuss the role of financial innovation in the economy and its implications for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The role and performance of services and financial services in the economy In the last few decades we have experienced a sustained trend towards services as a share of GDP at the expense of manufactured goods    .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Financial services have been an important part of this trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">At the aggregate euro area level, the financial sector accounts for a remarkable share of about 6% of total industries, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">including manufacturing, in terms of value added, with an average growth rate of more than 7%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">These numbers, however, mask a substantial heterogeneity among countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">In some countries the services sector has expanded to a considerable size, while in others this is not the case - the range is from Luxembourg, where the financial services sector accounts for more than 16,8% of value added, to countries such as Spain where it accounts for about 4,2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This leads us to the following questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.53,0)">To what extent are financial services at the service of the real economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.5,0)">Are they to a considerable extent disconnected from other sectors?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.02,0)">As yet these are open issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But when assessing the financial sector it is useful to consider more than its development in terms of size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The development of the role the services sector plays may be even more important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Financial services are critical to the allocation of capital in the economy and provide the means to channel inter-temporal decisions of savers and borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.79,0)">The manufacturing sector has declined in line with the growing importance of the service sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">However, owing to its productivity growth, it has been able to produce more goods with less labour input.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Likewise, growth and productivity of the financial services sector are important in their own right as a contribution to overall economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">However, it is also the role of this sector to be at the service of the real economy, by channelling resources to the most productive investment opportunities, those that are most significant for the smooth functioning of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Financial services allow the exchange of risks and the transfer of capital to prospective entrepreneurs; they enable households to choose investment profiles according to their needs and attitudes to risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.2,0)">Financial development and innovation The bumpy road from innovation to development It is well known that innovations do not translate one-to-one into productivity growth and that many other factors matter too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">In the financial sector, much innovation has been spurred by the interaction between banks and other financial intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Innovation in manufacturing and retail is about reducing costs, inventing new products and markets often as a part of a process of Schumpeterian “creative destruction”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Innovation in the financial sector is largely about risk – how to slice it, how to package it and how to trade it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">You can think of it in two dimensions, innovation in products , illustrated by new types of securities, and innovation in processes that can be related to new means of distributing securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Both of these dimensions have benefited from advances in information and communication technology  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">ICT has made the creation, valuation and exchange of complex financial products possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.06,0)">It has also affected the core of financial intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">But the increased efficiency has come at the cost of lack of transparency, the result of certain risk-management practices rather than computer software.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">As regards the first dimension, the innovations in products, derivatives stand out the most and are indeed at the epicentre of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The hedging strategies that are now commonplace would not have been possible without the advances in derivatives and ICT.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">On the lenders side, one of the more important effects of technological innovation on financial services is the abundance if not overabundance of real-time information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.8,0)">Since the costs of obtaining information have gone down dramatically with the advent of ICT, so have the costs of being in a particular market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The proliferation of derivatives did more than just reduce entry costs into a particular market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It also contributed to the second dimension of innovation, the innovation in processes, by changing the way certain types of securities changed hands and transactions were being conducted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This was most visible in the explosion of securitisation, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">the complex process in which risky securities were bundled together and then “tranched” again and again in an increasingly long chain of permutations and combinations which allowed risks to be customised and enabled issuers to reach an ever increasingly large investors base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">However, I would like to make two points here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.26,0)">First, it is difficult to precisely pin down the link between financial innovation and productivity in financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.73,0)">Just as productivity in the services sector as a whole is difficult to measure, it is especially the case in the financial sector: It is not easy to identify some kind of rough proxy for innovation because there is an almost infinite amount of data on the emergence and growth of new financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And if you consider productivity as being the efficiency with which financial services are provided it is not evident how this can be separated from improvements for example in infrastructure or ICT.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Second, while it is clear that financial innovation plays an important role in strengthening the investment chain and in efficiently managing risks, it has not had a smooth history, a point perhaps less necessary to emphasise today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.95,0)">With all its benefits for the economy, it is rather prone to wild swings and excessive volatility from time to time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.07,0)">There have been excessive asset price development, that have been difficult to reconcile with the fundamentals, not to mention bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The current crisis has even led a well-known economist to call this process “destructive creation”, a phrase which certainly seems to capture the mood of the times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.51,0)">Lax institutional framework led to several problems It is now widely recognised that the regulatory framework on the supervisory side and the risk management methods of the financial institutions have been lagging far behind financial innovations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">However, the challenges posed by financial innovation for market participants, supervisors, rating agencies and, last but not least, for investors have been huge: First, the boost in innovation in financial services was associated with new products and processes of increasing complexity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.54,0)">The derivatives have now become their own worst enemy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Their complexity combined with rapid growth of new types has been such that not only were borrowers unaware of the underlying risks but also, remarkably, the creators of these products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.18,0)">There is also the complexity or increasing in-transparency of the increasingly longer chains of intermediation and re-intermediation through “securitisation”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.39,0)">This made a further proper assessment of the risks even more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.11,0)">Indeed, recent advances in the field of behavioural finance indicate that, excessive complexity may lead to investment decisions being based on a rudimentary information set, not infrequently the last bit of information in the chain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.45,0)">For all the sophistication of mathematical finance, human beings have, by nature, a limited ability to acquire and process the relevant information from an over-abundance of information, much of which is in fact irrelevant for the decision at hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">While behavioural finance draws on research from psychology and other fields in cognitive science to support models of decision-making, I think we need to look no further than our own Inboxes with the emails we get every day to be convinced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.49,0)">Second, the abundance – or over-abundance – of real-time information may have created a great variety of trees but they have been so dense as to hide the wood itself and, just as with processed food, too much sugar has been added, which we know is not good for our health!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Third, the innovation boost came hand in hand with agency problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.61,0)">The agent, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.06,0)">the originator of the loan, had little incentive, if any to act in the interest of the holder of the loan  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.01,0)">It is often the case that banks have less incentive to control the credit quality of a loan they sell than of a loan they retain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.63,0)">A bank that has   monitored firms/borrowers’ projects has information about the pay-off coming from a prospective project, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">if it is likely to fail or succeed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This prompts the question whether the bank’s incentives to sell the loan are in line with risk control otherwise used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.25,0)">The recent experience of the sub-prime meltdown suggests that agency problems contributed to a deterioration of the loans’ underwriting standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.05,0)">They probably also played a part in the relatively large credit access to borrowers with weak financial positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Overall, it was the idiosyncrasy of the instruments combined with the overlay of technology that allowed lenders and borrowers, originators, securitisers and re-securitisers to be increasingly exposed to the full spectrum of shadow risks that they had originated, passed on and taken over again when unbundled in new forms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The institutional and regulatory framework was not able to keep all these developments under control and to ensure a smooth process of financial innovation with sufficient transparency as regards the new products and processes, with appropriate incentive structures, adequate risk management practices and a proper system of checks and balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.49,0)">Implications for monetary policy The financial sector is relatively small but has a large impact on overall productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">It is not only in this capacity, however, that financial sector productivity is extremely important for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I would like to highlight three aspects in this context: the role of financial sector productivity in the transmission process, the implications for monetary policy of shocks to productivity in financial services, and, finally, I would like to make a few remarks about monetary policy issues in turbulent times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The level of productivity in the financial sector is important in terms of both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is my first point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.4,0)">The following thoughts are necessarily tentative as it is unclear at this stage which components of recent financial innovation will survive the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I will assume in the following that innovations such as securitisation and structured credit products will remain with us also after the crisis, although this would necessitate that the paramount incentive problems which are at the root of the current crisis be properly addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.82,0)">The most traditional channel is the interest rate channel, whereby changes in central banks’ key, very short-term interest rates are reflected in the interest rates that banks pay on deposits and charge on loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">There is evidence that financial innovation has led to a stronger and faster pass-through from changes in policy rates to banks’ interest rates, in particular for banks which are very active in securitisation and derivatives markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The second channel is the so-called bank lending channel, operating via the effect of a monetary policy change on the asset side of banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.48,0)">For example, a monetary policy induced reduction of banks’ reserve holdings could lead to a contraction in loan supply if banks are not fully able to replenish their reserve holdings through the issuance of securities or deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">In this respect, “true sale” securitisation, in which the underlying credit is removed from the originating bank’s balance sheet, has provided banks with a formidable instrument to conserve on bank capital and reserves and to expand the asset side of their balance sheet through leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.55,0)">This development has weakened the traditional lending channel, to the extent that a change in monetary policy working through a change in bank reserves might not lead to a change in loan supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.22,0)">However, in situations in which the securitisation market grinds to a halt, such as is currently observed, the effectiveness of the bank lending channel may reassert itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.28,0)">The third channel is the balance sheet channel, relating to the balance sheet position of banks’ borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.35,0)">Via its impact on interest rates and, indirectly, on a vast array of asset prices, monetary policy can affect the net worth of borrowers and hence banks’ willingness to supply loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.77,0)">It may thus alter the credit premium that banks charge on loans over and above the rate at which they can collect funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.11,0)">The net effect of financial innovation on the balance sheet channel is somewhat ambiguous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.2,0)">On the one hand, new tools to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers might have contributed to compressing the external finance premium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Also, and perhaps most importantly, credit premium determination might have become largely independent of the creditworthiness – and the value of collateral pledged by – individual borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.79,0)">The explosion of sub-prime loans is a very telling example of this tendency of credit terms to become disconnected from the credit history and the balance sheet position of borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.23,0)">On the other hand, the more continuous pricing of credit market products offered by credit risk transfer instruments as well as the parallel move to fair-value accounting standards may have accentuated the sensitivity of the external finance premium to changes in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.08,0)">The fourth and last channel I will mention is the so-called risk-taking channel, relating to the potential impact of monetary policy on the risk-taking attitude of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">An important element in the run-up to the current crisis seems to have been banks’ tendency to target a specific leverage ratio or a certain risk metric  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In an environment of low interest rates and low inflation conducive to higher asset valuations banks might have been tempted to take on additional risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">There is no sound evidence that one can disentangle empirically this channel from the more traditional balance sheet channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.44,0)">So, it is premature to draw inferences on this dimension in any direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">However, one might presume that such mechanism might contribute to making bank behaviour more pro-cyclical and less predictable than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.04,0)">To sum up, financial innovation in the recent past has affected the various transmission channels of monetary policy in different ways, sometimes strengthening and sometimes weakening these channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Some of these mechanisms, such as the large diffusion of securitisation, have certainly increased the productivity of the financial sector, if measured by the ability of financial intermediaries to leverage capital and liquidity to expand their operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.47,0)">However, securitisation has also meant that the traditional chains of reactions that monetary policy used to rely upon to influence credit conditions might have become more tenuous and more difficult to predict.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.65,0)">The empirical evidence is yet too fragile and has mostly been derived for samples covering periods of booming securitisation and derivatives activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It remains to be seen whether these findings apply over the entire economic and asset price cycle or only during periods of low financial market volatility, ample liquidity and benign risk levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.66,0)">The second point elaborates on the question of how shocks to productivity in financial services are transmitted to the economy and what the implications are for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.28,0)">As productivity shocks are unobservable, there is considerable uncertainty about both their magnitude and persistence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Part of this uncertainty can be addressed by distinguishing transitory from permanent productivity shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.72,0)">The ECB’s focus is on the inflation effects of productivity shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.4,0)">The impact on inflation depends on supply and demand effects: As regards supply effects, negative productivity shocks contract – at least temporarily – the supply of goods or financial services and thereby tend to increase prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">D emand effects work through the wealth channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.29,0)">If economic agents perceive a negative productivity shock to be permanent, they will feel poorer and reduce their spending in proportion to the perceived decrease in wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.27,0)">If, however, they perceive this shock to be transitory, economic agents’ perceived wealth will remain more or less unchanged and the fall in demand will be muted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.23,0)">This suggests that transitory negative productivity shocks will be associated with some degree of excess demand, pushing up inflation, whereas permanent negative productivity shocks could be associated with either excess supply or excess demand, depending on the perceived decrease in wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.52,0)">Is what we are experiencing right now a negative shock to financial sector productivity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.52,0)">And, if so, is it permanent?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.52,0)">It is not easy to answer these questions because of the high level of uncertainty we face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.5,0)">Confidence in the private sector has been heavily affected, in particular after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, suggesting that the decrease in wealth perceived by agents around the world is very large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.64,0)">What can central banks do in this situation of heightened uncertainty?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">The short answer is: reduce uncertainty by providing a firm anchor for private sector expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.81,0)">This is precisely what the ECB has been doing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And this leads me to my third point: monetary policy in turbulent times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Our monetary policy strategy is rendering us very valuable services in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">In particular, the monetary analysis helps us to obtain a robust assessment of the balance of risks to price stability and, ultimately, to adopt the monetary policy stance that is appropriate in order to fulfil our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In these challenging times, core principles derived from the cumulated experience of central banks over a very long period of time have been the firm basis that has guided the monetary policy of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Allow me to briefly mention the most important of these principles: First, monetary policy must be given a clear and unambiguous mandate to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Second, the central bank must be credible in its commitment to deliver this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Third, the central bank must be independent of political influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Fourth, so as to maintain its legitimacy, an institution endowed with independence to pursue a specific public objective must act in a transparent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Fifth, monetary policy must maintain a medium-term orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Sixth, monetary policy must be underpinned by a comprehensive analytical framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Given the importance of maintaining credibility and a medium-term orientation, such a framework must include a thorough analysis of monetary and credit developments, reflecting the necessarily monetary nature of inflation over the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Finally, a clear distinction must be maintained between the determination of the monetary policy stance required to maintain price stability and the provision of liquidity to the money market, the so-called “ separation principle”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">These principles should be the cornerstones of monetary policy-making in normal times but, arguably, become even more important in a time of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In this respect, I would say that our monetary policy, while being pragmatic, has consistently followed these principles and has thus been able to address the challenges that the financial market tensions have brought about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Allow me to briefly illustrate this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Our single, clear and unambiguous mandate has ensured that attention has remained focused on the attainment of our objective of maintaining price stability, at a time when other considerations could have come to the fore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">At the same time, our monetary policy strategy has ensured that the appropriate medium-term orientation of monetary policy has been maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In particular, the monetary pillar embedded in our strategy ensures that due attention is paid at all times to medium-term developments in nominal variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The identification of the policy-relevant signal in monetary developments requires a detailed examination of bank balance sheets, complemented by the analysis of other sources of financial information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This is instrumental in understanding market developments, monitoring financial innovation and assessing its implications, for instance, for the transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">In this respect, a thorough and broad-based monetary analysis not only provides relevant information on risks to consumer price inflation, but can also support the early detection of financial imbalances and asset price misalignments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Finally, by having a clear separation between the monetary policy stance, which as explained, has maintained the appropriate medium-term orientation, and its implementation through liquidity operations, we have proved able to act in the liquidity management domain rapidly and, when necessary, significantly, to support the functioning of the money market that is central to the implementation and transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Concluding remarks Allow me to summarise my remarks with the following points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.62,0)">The long phase of heightened risk appetite has now come to an end, with effects over the foreseeable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">We have observed and will continue to see a consolidation of the financial services
