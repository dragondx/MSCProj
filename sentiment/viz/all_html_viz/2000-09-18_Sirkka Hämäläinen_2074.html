    <h3> Speaker: Sirkka Hämäläinen </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)"> The euro and the dollar - new imperatives for policy co-ordination Speech delivered by Ms Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at conference "Transatlantic Financial Policy Co-ordination in an Age of Global Capital Markets", at the European Institute, New York, 18 September 2000 Ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I should like to thank the European Institute, and its President Ms Jacqueline Grapin, for inviting me to provide my remarks for this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I find it particularly interesting to do so because the theme of the conference "Transatlantic Financial Policy Co-ordination in an Age of Global Capital Markets", touches upon an issue which represents an increasing challenge for policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This is certainly very true for central bankers, and especially for those central bankers whose currencies perform an international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">On the one hand, our mandates and our institutional objectives are defined in "domestic" terms, while on the other hand, the fields in which we operate to achieve these objectives are increasingly global.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Financial markets, where we conduct our operations and which are at the core of the transmission process of monetary policy, are indeed global markets nowadays.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This raises the issue of whether we can achieve our domestic objectives with domestic policies, or whether the globalisation of the economy calls for a similar globalisation of economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I shall concentrate my remarks on this topic around two propositions: First, the globalisation of financial markets requires reflection on the co-ordination of basic rules rather than the co-ordination of policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Second, in the context of interdependent economies, global stability can be achieved if there is a similarity of policy objectives across different areas, but individual policy-makers primarily concentrate on keeping their own houses in order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">As I discuss these two propositions I shall, if I may, use for illustration purposes some elements of the European experience in these fields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Globalisation and the need for co-ordination of basic rules When talking about globalisation, it may be a good idea to start by defining what we mean by this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">After all, cross-border economic transactions have always been part of our landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The degree of interdependence of our economies, the degree of internationalisation of production, trade and finance are without doubt greater now than at any period in history, but they are not without precedent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">So there must be something which is now different, which has justified the coining of the new word "globalisation".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.93,0)">One element of the answer may be the fact that, when we talk about globalisation, we refer generally to the "invisible" part of the economy: money, information, immaterial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Both in the United States and in Europe, this invisible part is becoming ever more important and the speed of interaction has increased dramatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">This is very significant, because it represents a much stronger challenge to the concept of sovereignty than in earlier periods of history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.05,0)">Traditionally, the notion of sovereignty is associated with the idea that economic activity conducted on the territory of one country is ultimately subject to the laws and regulations of that country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This implicitly assumes that it is possible to identify and, to a certain degree, to control the activity conducted in a country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.17,0)">This is increasingly difficult - even impossible - as regards the invisible or immaterial part of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">With the development of new technologies, information and financial transactions can circulate around the world in a matter of seconds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.88,0)">They cannot be stopped at national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The new concept "globalisation" can be seen as referring to activities which cannot be contained in the boundaries of the traditional national legal and regulatory systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">We should not underestimate the consequences of this concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Indeed, one reason why we welcome the development of cross-border economic relationships between countries is that it promotes the smooth functioning of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.36,0)">I did not choose the words I have just used at random.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">They are inscribed in the Treaty establishing the European Community, and underline our attachment to the principles of a free market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There is no questioning your attachment, in the United States, to the same principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, we should not forget that a market economy is not only an economic model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is also a model of social organisation, based on a number of rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.57,0)">I am referring here both to such basic elements as the respect of private property, or the obligation to fulfil the terms of a contract and also to more elaborate rules, such as the regulation of financial markets or financial intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Binding rules in these areas are essential to create a climate of discipline and confidence in the economic and financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.61,0)">Without this confidence in the system, there is no real economic freedom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">As some segments of economies have become global, it is sensible to ensure that at the global level there is a set of rules similar to those that we take for granted at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">One example, directly relevant for a central banker, is that the globalisation of financial markets has meant that financial stability is no longer a domestic issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This argues in favour of laying down - either at the international level or in a co-ordinated way at the national level - legal or regulatory rules which are as conducive as possible to the smooth functioning of the global financial system and to its stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Many fora, such as the International Monetary Fund   or the Bank for International Settlements  , are working on these issues and it is important that the rules they establish - whether related to capital adequacy requirements, transparency, or other topics - apply to all participants in the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">This represents an important and necessary field for co-operation among policy-makers, not only in Europe and in the United States, but all over the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">In fact, our experience in Europe argues strongly in favour of such an approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The process of European integration is different on many counts from the process of globalisation of the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In particular, European integration has been politically driven, but it has also been taking place among countries which are exceptionally homogenous from a cultural, economic and political point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">Yet, in spite of this traditional homogeneity, there are national differences and it was felt very early on that economic integration could not be successful without a set of common rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In Europe, such common rules are achieved through the use of Community legislation, which is imposed at a higher level than national legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Policy co-ordination: Independence in interdependence Let me now come to my second proposition, which is that, in the context of interdependent economies, the primary concern of monetary policy-makers should be to keep their own house in order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This may seem paradoxical, because I have just advocated the need for common rules beyond the national level in a number of fields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In addition, I represent the ECB, which has been established as a consequence of the fact that 11 countries - soon to be 12 with the accession of Greece - have decided to go beyond monetary policy co-ordination by adopting a single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Allow me to try to explain this apparent paradox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Paul Volcker said in January this year that "if we are to have a truly global economy, a single world currency makes sense".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.11,0)">However, he immediately added that he would not live to see this single world currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I do not know whether we shall one day have a single world currency, but I am quite certain that I shall not live to see it either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.66,0)">Indeed, in order to be able to introduce a single currency among European countries, a number of stringent conditions had to be met.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">First, of course, there needed to be a high level of convergence between our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Second, a strong consensus on the objective of monetary policy was necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Based on the negative experience of high inflation in many European countries in the 1970s and 1980s, a strong consensus had indeed emerged on the monetary policy objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Finally, and this is very important, there needed to be a solid perception of common interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">What I mean by this is that the European people needed not only to agree on the objective of price stability, but also on the fact that this objective had to be defined at a pan-European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">They had to be willing to exchange goods and services among themselves against a currency, the euro, which would not be linked to gold or to the power of the state, and which has no value other than the confidence placed in it by them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In view of the sovereignty of the countries participating in the euro area, we do not have a single fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.3,0)">Every country has its own fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This reflects the view among Europeans that the terms of fiscal policy are better defined at the national rather than the Community level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.75,0)">This may relate, for instance, to different perceptions of what the emphasis of fiscal policy should be, such as education, defence, or public transportation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.51,0)">It may also reflect different views on the degree of social security and welfare to be provided through public means.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.27,0)">There are also differences in structure between different countries on such issues as, for instance, labour market regulation or pension policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.24,0)">Therefore, according to the principle of subsidiarity, fiscal policy issues remain the responsibility of the national - and sometimes regional or local - authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This, however, should in no way be misinterpreted as an obstacle to the smooth functioning of the single currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A centralised fiscal policy is not a requirement for the conduct of the single monetary policy, to the extent that the decentralised policies are efficiently co-ordinated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">There is a broad agreement that fiscal policies should be "disciplined".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This is the purpose of the Stability and Growth Pact of the EU countries, which is quite similar to the US concept of a balanced budget target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Insofar as each EU Member State observes the terms of this Pact, fiscal policy-makers are free to adjust their policy to accommodate any shocks which may affect their economies in a different way to those of other Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">What we have here is what I would call, borrowing the phrase from Charles de Gaulle, a situation of "independence in interdependence".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the context of interdependent economies, there is a similarity of goals  , but independent implementation of the policy required to achieve these goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">This is conducive to the overall stability of the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">If I extend this example to monetary policies in the global economy, I find that there is a somewhat similar situation to that I have just described for fiscal policy in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Indeed, the goals of monetary policy are defined in broadly similar terms in the United States, Japan, the euro area and many other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">There is a wide consensus that price stability should be the main objective of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Even though our goals are similar, however, there is no single, global goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I think this argues strongly against accommodating, in the formulation of our monetary policy stance, international factors beyond the influence of external economic developments on domestic prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Rather, I firmly believe that by concentrating monetary policy on domestic stability in each region of the global economy, monetary policy-makers actually best contribute toalleviating global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This creates what I described earlier as a situation of independence in interdependence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.44,0)">On the one hand, the globalisation of the openness of our economies creates a situation of interdependence, because the balance of risks to price stability is also affected by external factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">On the other hand, a monetary policy geared towards domestic price stability must remain independent so that it has maximum flexibility to accommodate these external, as well as internal, developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Conclusion In conclusion, I should like to come back to Paul Volcker's prophecy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">He might be right, and we might one day have a single world currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Maybe European integration, in the same way as any other regional integration, could be seen as a step towards the ideal situation of a fully integrated world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">If and when this world will see the light of day is impossible to say.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.3,0)">However, what I can say is that this vision seems as impossible now to most of us as a European monetary union seemed 50 years ago, when the process of European integration started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The globalisation of the economy, by contrast, is already a reality today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Moreover, this is a situation that we must handle in the present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It is important to consider the consequence that the the smooth functioning of the global financial system and its stability requires that certain common rules are established at a global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">It is also important that we recognise that global stability will be enhanced if the goals and aims of macroeconomic policies are as similar as possible across the different regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Finally, I firmly believe that within this framework the best contribution that policy-makers can make to global stability is to keep their own house in order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.64,0)">Ladies and gentlemen,</span>
