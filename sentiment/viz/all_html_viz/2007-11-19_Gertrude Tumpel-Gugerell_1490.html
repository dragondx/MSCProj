    <h3> Speaker: Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)"> Going the extra mile to be ready for SEPA Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB delivered at 10th Euro Finance Week - SEPA Summit: “Ready for SEPA?” Frankfurt am Main, 19 November 2007 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great honour for me to open this conference, the SEPA Summit, which is organised for the second time in Frankfurt as part of the Euro Finance Week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Special attention in this year’s Euro Finance Week is given to the integration of European financial markets in a common regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Indeed, the title of this Week “European Finance and Insurance between Regulation and Innovation” is directly related to the SEPA project as SEPA is all about harmonisation, modernisation and innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">It is also a great pleasure to welcome you to Frankfurt, the city of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.97,0)">Frankfurt is often characterised as the smallest metropolis in the world, in which there is a lot to discover at close hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Indeed, Frankfurt is a European meeting place and an intersection for trade and finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">A perhaps lesser-known fact is that Frankfurt is also an important intersection for telecommunication and internet providers, as major data networks cross here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Indeed, 90% of German and 35% of European internet traffic is channelled through Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">We are, therefore, at the right location to discuss SEPA and the development of the European payment markets in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I would like today to express the views and expectations of the Eurosystem on the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But let me first take a brief look at past achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The 2006 SEPA Summit focused mainly on building up all relevant stakeholders’ commitment to SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Last year, the President of the ECB and myself underlined the opportunities which financial integration in general and SEPA in particular could bring to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">We also concluded that much more had to be done to reap these benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">I specifically called for a closer involvement and dialogue with all stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Since then a lot of progress has been made and I am glad to see that, in general, the SEPA project is well on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The basic SEPA components for euro payments have been developed, such as the SEPA credit transfer and the SEPA direct debit, as has the regulatory framework under the Payment Services Directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Each national community has set up a forum for stakeholders to discuss the upcoming changes related to SEPA, and a European forum has been established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">It is also impressive to see that many banks have made substantial preparations in order to launch the SEPA credit transfer in January 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It is expected that over 80% of banks representing the majority of credit transfer transactions   will be operationally ready.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The banks will demonstrate their commitment to SEPA at a signing event at the end of today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Financial integration is also progressing well in other fields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is a particular coincidence that TARGET2, the next generation of the Eurosystem’s large value payment system, will be launched today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">TARGET2 is an important milestone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">It will offer Europe a more uniform wholesale payment infrastructure, with a harmonised service level and a single price structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Thus, TARGET2 is another good example of progress in the creation of a common payments area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let’s now turn to this year’s SEPA Summit, which is called “Ready for SEPA?”, and rightly so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In my view, this question is not limited to the mere operational readiness of the industry to offer SEPA payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I consider the topic of this conference to be broader.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The question should perhaps be understood as, is the industry ready to create a “truly integrated” Single Euro Payments Area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The ECB sees SEPA as a major catalyst for more financial integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">SEPA will influence the payment landscape in Europe for many years to come and this will involve a re-think by all the parties involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.18,0)">Indeed, it is not enough to defend current market positions or current practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Rather, the point is that SEPA will benefit those who bring innovative services to their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">SEPA will benefit those who are future oriented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Today I would like to focus in particular on two issues, both of which are much discussed by banks and which are needed to create a truly integrated SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.54,0)">The two main questions are, first, what about the readiness of customers?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And second, what about the readiness of other payment instruments, in particular payment cards?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me first give you my views on the readiness of the customer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Readiness of customers?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">A parallel can be drawn with another major project, namely the changeover to the euro notes and coins in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.44,0)">Indeed, as with SEPA, many of the preparations for the euro changeover were not visible to the citizens, as they were carried out by technical experts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Furthermore, the banknotes’ security features were disclosed only four months before the launch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.62,0)">As with SEPA, it was difficult to predict how the customer would react.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">On the other hand, well before the euro changeover took place, the central banking community discussed customer readiness in depth with the aim to ensure acceptance of the euro notes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Well in advance of 2002, the Eurosystem started organising a “partnership programme” that involved the main bodies in the various sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">This partnership programme emerged from the “megaphone idea” and the understanding that communication on the changeover to the euro had to be at national level by the national public authorities, banking communities and end-user associations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Each sector was encouraged to inform their target groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Indeed, as if with a “megaphone”, the Eurosystem passed on a common set of key messages to target groups, and they in turn passed on the information to others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Applying the principle of subsidiarity in this context proved itself as the correct way to deal with differences in culture, language and institutional setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Another characteristic of the changeover was related to the timetable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.3,0)">All countries set an end date for the euro changeover, the dates were not harmonised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.57,0)">In some participating Member States the official changeover period was kept very short; in others it covered a maximum period of two months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Despite the absence of a harmonised timetable, the euro changeover in 2002 was a major success, and the whole changeover process was almost completed after only two weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This clearly shows that the clarity of the information on the end date given in the information campaigns had been key, and customers in fact did not want to wait until that final date to begin using the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The experiences of the euro changeover are very relevant for the SEPA project, which is comparable in size, complexity and political relevance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">I see, in particular, two main lessons to be learned from the changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">First, more communication on SEPA is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">I am not implying that the industry should carry out a similar launch campaign, but the industry should step up its efforts to foster customer readiness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">To be as successful as the euro changeover, the SEPA project must build up a closer “partnership” with stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Some national communities have already closely involved the end-users, and have published reports on the developments of the different stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">In Germany, for example, I have noticed that some of the larger banks have begun an advertising campaign on SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">I encourage other communities to follow these examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.81,0)">Let me also be clear on one related point: Banks should not try “misusing” SEPA, and blaming SEPA for any unpleasant changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In that case, we could end up with a similar debate on perceived price increases as we did after the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.66,0)">This would help nobody - neither the industry nor the customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Second, the industry should be clearer on the timetable for the “dual circulation” period of its instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The request for clarity on the end date also comes from end-user associations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Interesting in this respect is the ECB’s recent study in cooperation with the banking industry analysing the economic impact of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The study confirms that two main forces will come to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.18,0)">On the one hand, cross-border competition and new market participants could affect the revenue side of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">On the other, automation and electronic processes will enable banks to achieve efficiency gains and cost reductions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The study concludes that the dual implementation phase of SEPA should be as short as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">As initial investments and higher adaptation costs are necessary in the short run, it is for the banks to decide how they will adapt to the new environment in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Indeed, a shorter changeover to SEPA will allow banks to focus more on their offering of innovative products in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.66,0)">One of the more active SEPA communities, France, has already indicated an expected end date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">This is a positive example, and other communities should follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Should, however, banks need more preparation when they move to the new SEPA framework, the ECB and the European Commission stand ready to consider supporting measures, including regulation, if required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Let me now turn to the readiness of the industry for SEPA card payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I will briefly present some of the ECB’s views on cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Later today the panel will provide their views on the new cards landscape in SEPA and I am looking forward to an interesting discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Readiness of SEPA card payments?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Card payments are closely monitored by the Eurosystem because they are now the most popular non-cash payment instrument in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">According to our Blue Book statistics, more than 15 billion card payments were made in the euro area in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Between 2000 and 2006, we also noticed that the use of cards increased more quickly than the use of other instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The use of cards increased at an impressive rate of 15% per annum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">The impact of any changes in the card market is significant for all stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.85,0)">Given that the overall cost of payments at a point of sale ranges between 0.4% and 0.65% of GDP  , it is clear that any development in the card market also has major implications for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">An increased use of cards will reduce some of the costs related to other payments, such as cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">On several occasions, the Eurosystem has voiced its expectations regarding SEPA for cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">In particular, the card schemes should offer consumer choice, operate in competitive markets and avoid geographical segmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">In doing so, the Eurosystem expects that the SEPA for cards offers high efficiency and low prices derived from current best practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In my view, a clear long term strategy of a SEPA for cards is not yet developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The Eurosystem expects at least one new European card scheme which can compete with the international schemes in the SEPA environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I’ll address this issue more in depth in the following panel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">What I would like to stress, however, is that the Eurosystem welcomes the progress that has been made towards standardisation for cards, which, when implemented, will lead to the creation of a European market for terminals and for cards acquiring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The Eurosystem also welcomes the efforts of the international card schemes in preparing for SEPA and the SEPA changes they have already announced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">I also hope that the European Commission will soon formulate its view on interchange fees, so that uncertainties in this field are removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Before I conclude, I would like to concentrate on an important additional issue: innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Innovation As I stressed at the beginning of my speech, SEPA is all about harmonisation, modernisation and innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The SEPA project has come a long way, but the process is far from being completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">More modernisation and innovation is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.25,0)">The information and communication technology is continuously evolving and we cannot lean back and watch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">SEPA must evolve, and the SEPA products should be complemented with value-added services allowing customers to make payments, fast, easy and secure and, most importantly, as much as possible paper-free.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I am here talking about initiation and confirmation services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Combining these services with the SEPA payments will make the payment process fully electronic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.58,0)">End-users will spend less time on payments – and less time also means less money!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We refer to this perspective as the next stage of the SEPA project: eSEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">eSEPA promises significant financial benefits for banks and customers via: Cost savings Added revenue Customer retention through value-added differentiation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Let me quickly run through three examples: SEPA Online Payments The European Payments Council   has worked on a project that enables online merchants to offer their customers a convenient, well-know payment solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">It could become one of the convincing responses of the European banking industry to the competitive challenge posed by PayPal and similar new types of payment service providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">I would explicitly like to encourage the banking industry, and especially the EPC, to step up the work on the new payment methods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Mobile payments This is a market segment where the development in Europe is still in its infancy - although high expectations had been raised a few years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">On a global level, m-payment initiatives have now gained strong new momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The GSM Association has announced the next steps of its Pay-Buy-Mobile initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">This initiative builds on the infrastructure of the major credit card companies and aims at enabling global interoperability between contactless chip cards and point of sale terminals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">At the same time the EPC is looking for viable models of m-payment solutions for the SEPA market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Potential benefits could be for example an even higher level of payment convenience, speed and security experienced by the users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">These types of benefits are the reason why I think that the EPC’s official dialogue with the mobile industry should start soon, to define viable cooperative models and standards for this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">E-invoicing: I mention e-invoicing in the context of eSEPA because it offers a vast potential of benefits to users and providers alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For the private consumers, the most significant advantage may be convenience: just imagine that you receive your invoices electronically and can directly initiate their payments with one tick or click.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">This is already reality in some countries, but should become available across SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Even more benefits are possible for corporates, since settling paper invoices is usually a very cost-intensive process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Just imagine that 97.5% of all invoices worldwide are estimated to be paper-based!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.29,0)">Let’s think about the average unit cost for a biller per invoice and the average unit cost for a payer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.55,0)">Incoming invoices need to be copied, forwarded, entered into different systems and stored – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.28,0)">touched and managed by a large number of hands and transported physically between all of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">These procedures – and also potential mistakes happening along the handling chain - can be significantly changed by introducing electronic invoices that allow seamless automated handling, including direct links e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">to payment functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Approximately 27 billion invoices per annum are being produced in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">It is obvious that any change leading to their more efficient handling quickly results in billions of possible savings per year for the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">How to foster the development of European E-Invoicing has become an important topic for the European Commission, who is currently setting up an official working group to coordinate the standardisation approaches, to address the legal barriers as well as issues of trust and operational risk.. Let me now briefly conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Conclusion With just a few months before the launch of SEPA, banks are making preparations in order to be ready.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">I have been closely enough involved to see the tremendous efforts made by the banking industry, and I expect that the vast majority of banks will be operationally ready for SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.13,0)">Operational readiness is, however, not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Indeed, SEPA is the next step of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.66,0)">January 2008 will only be the start of this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">SEPA will enhance pan-European competition and foster integration, consolidation and innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">SEPA requires us to take a broad view that goes beyond operational readiness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In the coming months, we need to go the extra mile and make an additional effort to ensure the readiness of customers and the card payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We also need to think about the next steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">And there are, indeed, important further steps in this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Creative solutions will pay off!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.57,0)">Some years ago SEPA was an idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In 70 days, SEPA will be reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">I wish you an open and fruitful conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.97,0)">=</span>
