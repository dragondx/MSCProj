    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)"> The process of European financial integration: where do we stand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBCampus for Finance 2006, WHU Otto Beisheim School of ManagementVallendar, 13 January 2006 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, dear students, I would like to start by thanking the organisers of Campus for Finance 2006 for inviting me to speak here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The turn of the year is always a good opportunity to assess the past and glance at the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Today, barely two weeks into the New Year, I will do precisely this with a topic that is of interest to market participants, policy-makers and academics alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And it is a topic that is also of the utmost interest to the ECB: namely, the process of European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">I would like to give you my assessment of where we stand at present, and also highlight those aspects where financial integration could be enhanced further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.75,0)">I will structure my remarks as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First, I would like to explain why financial integration is important for the welfare of European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I will then briefly explain the conceptual background underlying our assessment of the state of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Finally, I will elaborate on the current state of financial integration in the euro area, based on the indicators recently published by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I will organise my assessment according to the different segments of the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In doing so, I will also mention some specific Eurosystem activities that aim to foster financial integration, and I will touch upon some of the EU policy issues in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Why is European financial integration important?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In 2006 Campus for Finance is focusing on the topic of “Fixed income – lending, borrowing, and taking risk”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Financial systems in general serve not only to channel funds from those who have a surplus to those who have a shortage of savings, but they also serve to trade, hedge, diversify and pool risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">These functions help us to understand the economic benefits that can be derived from financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">There are two widely accepted economic benefits of financial integration: first, the better sharing and diversification of risk; and second, the increase of the potential for higher economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me explain this in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">First, the better diversification and sharing of risk brought about by financial integration helps to fulfil the conditions for the optimality of a currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In recent years, an interesting development in the theory of optimal currency areas has been the idea that the optimality of a currency area is not necessarily something that needs to be achieved fully before monetary union; but something that may also be the result of monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The introduction of the euro clearly fostered financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">With the euro, economic agents from a given region can, by being able to invest more easily in other regions of the euro area, diversify the risk of potential shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Steps towards increased financial integration reduce the risk of local factors impacting on the income and consumption of a given region within the area, thereby helping to fulfil the conditions for an optimal currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Second, financial integration is a key factor in the development of the financial system, which, in turn, increases the potential for greater and more sustainable non-inflationary economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">By making markets deeper and more liquid, financial integration creates economies of scale and increases the supply of funds for investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The integration process fosters competition and the expansion of markets and intermediation, thereby leading to further financial development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Financial development, in turn, leads to lower intermediation costs and a more efficient allocation of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Allocating resources to the most productive investment opportunities will ultimately increase the potential economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">For example, a research study estimates the benefits from the integration of European bonds and equity markets to be around 1% of GDP growth over a ten-year period, or approximately €100 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">While these figures can be subject to estimation error, economic reasoning suggests that the overall benefits of financial integration will remain significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">As you know, Europe urgently needs to strengthen growth and increase employment, which are the two main goals of the recently renewed Lisbon programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The need to proceed with structural reforms in Europe is not confined to the “real” side of the economy, like the necessity to enhance flexibility in the European labour markets, but applies also to financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.55,0)">Financial markets that are not yet fully integrated imply a cost in terms of foregone economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Furthermore, as a central banker, I am very conscious of the fact that a well-integrated financial system is essential for the implementation of our monetary policy, as it enhances the smooth and effective transmission of monetary policy impulses throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.0,0)">Indeed, if the financial system were not fully integrated, the single monetary policy decisions may have an asymmetric impact on the different regions of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The degree of financial integration is therefore important in determining the effectiveness of this transmission: the higher the degree of financial integration, the more effectively this transmission will work in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Finally, I would also like to mention that financial integration is relevant for our task – as provided for by the Treaty – of contributing to the safeguarding of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Financial system stability requires the financial system’s principal components to be jointly capable of absorbing adverse disturbances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">It also requires that the financial system is facilitating a smooth and efficient reallocation of financial resources from savers to investors, that financial risk is being assessed and priced accurately and that risks are being efficiently managed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.09,0)">Inefficiencies in the reallocation of capital or shortcomings in the pricing of risk can compromise future financial system stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.13,0)">A lack of financial stability can therefore be related directly to inefficiencies that may arise from a non-integrated financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Being aware of the links between financial integration and financial stability is therefore essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">These links are twofold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">On the one hand, integrated financial markets offer better opportunities for financing and risk diversification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">As the pool of available assets for investment is broadened, potentially enhancing the heterogeneity of financial institutions’ portfolios, the ensuing wider spread of portfolio-related risks should reinforce the resilience and shock-absorption capacity of financial intermediaries, thus improving the soundness and robustness of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">On the other hand, financial integration implies a structural transformation of the financial system, including the creation of intensified cross-border financial links and therefore calls for new appropriate measures to ensure financial stability in a renewed integrated financial system context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">To summarise, the effects of financial integration on the stability of the financial system can be expected to be positive in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The structural transformation of the financial system through enhanced financial integration requires that we closely monitor the financial integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The conceptual background for the ECB’s assessment of the state of European financial integration I would now like to discuss the conceptual background for our understanding and assessment of the process of European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Under the Treaty, the Eurosystem acts “in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This general principle also determines the Eurosystem’s view that financial integration is first and foremost a market-driven process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In addition to this, the Eurosystem sees it as a basic task of public authorities to create a framework that is conducive to fostering financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">If the opportunities thus created have been exploited by market forces, true financial integration will have been achieved and its benefits been reaped fully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">To make these concepts operational, the ECB has adopted the following definition of financial integration: we consider the market for a given set of financial instruments or services to be fully integrated when all potential market participants in such market   are subject to a single set of rules when they decide to deal with those financial instruments or services,   have equal access to this set of financial instruments or services, and   are treated equally when they operate in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">While, in practice, we are facing a process of financial integration, this definition describes a state of full, or perfect, integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">By providing a benchmark against which we can assess the state of financial integration, this definition underpins our analytical and empirical analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">A natural basis for the development of quantitative measures of financial integration is to check the validity of the law of one price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The law of one price states that assets with identical risks and returns characteristics should be priced identically regardless of where they are transacted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.57,0)">The law of one price is in fact an implication of our definition of financial integration: if all agents face the same rules, have equal access and are treated equally, any price difference between two identical assets will be immediately arbitraged away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.56,0)">Still, there are cases where the law of one price is not directly applicable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.1,0)">For instance, an asset may not be allowed to be listed on another region’s exchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.25,0)">While the law of one price has little to say about this case, we would consider this to be an obstacle to financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Our wider definition of financial integration in fact also encompasses such obstacles to financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The current state of European financial integration, including some selected Eurosystem activities and EU policy issues This background information leads me now to the main part of my speech, namely to illustrate the current state and the evolution of financial integration in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Last September, the ECB published, for the first time, a set of indicators regarding the state of integration of euro area financial and banking markets, along with an explanatory report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">With this publication, the ECB aims to regularly measure and monitor financial integration in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">We consider two broad categories of indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.62,0)">Price-based indicators measure discrepancies in asset prices based on their geographic origin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Quantity-based indicators are used to investigate the extent to which investors engage in cross-border asset portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Such quantitative measures offer the advantage of being able to assess both the current level of financial integration and its evolution over time, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">whether integration is progressing, stable, or even regressing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">A number of previous speakers at the Campus for Finance 2006 have looked at specific financial market segments, inter alia the government bond market, corporate bond markets, equity markets, securitisation markets and debt markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I will now cover all these major market segments from the point of view of the state of their integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">I will also touch upon selected Eurosystem activities that aim to foster financial integration, and highlight some of the EU policy issues in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.33,0)">Our first publication covers the money market, the government and corporate bond market, the equity market and the banking markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">While the euro generally acted as a major catalyst for the integration of all these markets, the degree of integration differs between market segments, with integration being more advanced in those market segments that are closer to the single monetary policy, above all the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">So let me start with the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.63,0)">Our indicators for the euro money market measure integration on the basis of the dispersion of lending rates for actual transactions or rates offered by EONIA, EURIBOR and EUREPO panel banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The unsecured interbank deposit market was almost perfectly integrated right at the start of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.16,0)">The cross-country standard deviation of the average overnight lending rates among euro area countries was as low as three basis points in early 1999 and has since then decreased to just one basis point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.26,0)">Just to give for comparison a figure from the time before Monetary Union, let me mention that in January 1998, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">one year before the start of Monetary Union, the cross-country standard deviation was still higher than 130 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In fact, such integration is a sine qua non for monetary policy implementation, since only an integrated interbank market ensures an even distribution of central bank liquidity and a homogeneous level of short-term interest rates across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">And this rapid integration has been mostly supported by the establishment of the related payment system infrastructure, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">our TARGET system, which has been operational since the first day of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The launch of the single shared platform, TARGET2, planned for November 2007, will enhance financial integration even further, as it will provide a harmonised level of service and a single price structure for domestic and cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The running of this large-value payment system is a very concrete example of how we provide central banking services that are conducive to fostering financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Our indicators for one-month and 12-month maturities also consistently show a highly integrated unsecured money market, with the respective cross-country standard deviation of EURIBOR lending rates among euro area countries standing, since early 1999, at values not higher than, and normally below, one basis point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Finally, our indicators also confirm a relatively high degree of integration for the repo market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.67,0)">The EUREPO index was launched in March 2002, and since then, the euro area cross-country standard deviation of the one-month EUREPO rates has been around, and normally below, one basis point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.15,0)">The indicator for the 12-month maturity shows a standard deviation of around, and normally below, two basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">The decisive role of the euro in enhancing financial market integration is also visible in the interest rate derivatives markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">A particularly important segment is the euro interest rate swap market  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This has, in fact, become the largest interest rate swap market in the world!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.8,0)">The least integrated money market segment is the short-term securities market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The European commercial paper and certificates of deposit markets are segmented in several market places.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">But I expect that the current fragmentation will be reduced in the future as a result of the Short-Term European Paper   initiative, led by ACI – The Financial Markets Association.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The purpose of this initiative is to promote the convergence of standards and practices prevailing in the European short-term securities markets, which is expected to provide an impulse towards integration, thereby increasing the market’s depth and liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The promoters of this initiative expect the first STEP-labelled programme to be issued early this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">The Eurosystem acts as a catalyst and supports this market-led initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In particular, it will provide technical support for the labelling process for some time and will produce and publish STEP statistics on yields and volumes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I will now move on to the government bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Government bond markets have achieved a very high degree of integration, mainly due to the disappearance of intra-euro area exchange rate risk and the convergence of inflation expectations across countries by the time the euro was introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.82,0)">Since then, government bond yields in different euro area countries have been driven mainly by euro area-wide factors and news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">A simple way to quantify the degree of integration in this market segment is to look at developments in the standard deviation of yield spreads over time: the lower the dispersion, the higher the degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.2,0)">Our respective indicator shows a significant drop in the run-up to the start of Monetary Union and, since then, the standard deviation has remained close to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Another indicator is the “beta-convergence”, that is based on the economic intuition that the more integrated the market is, the more bond yields should react to common factors instead of local factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.06,0)">The “betas” represent the estimated correlation of changes in a government bond yield of a given country with changes in a respective benchmark bond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">It results that the betas varied substantially up to 1998 and converged afterwards towards the integration level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Let me stress here an important point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In assessing the indicators of the financial integration of European government bond markets, it of course has to be borne in mind that movements related to changes in the credit risk perceptions by the market do not signal a variation in the degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.06,0)">Such “local news” will continue to have an impact on bond yields in different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Integration of European government bond markets means that yields converge across countries to the extent that the underlying bonds have identical risk-return characteristics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.94,0)">A government bond of a country with a higher fiscal deficit is riskier than a government bond of a country with a lower deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Consequently, it is to be expected that yields in the first case are higher than government bond yields of the country with the lower deficit, even with perfect integration of government bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">There is, therefore, no contradiction between European financial integration, as promoted by our published indicators, and the ECB’s view that markets should accurately price different budgetary policies into bond yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">And, let me mention this by way of digression, as a result of the still existing different fiscal positions of Member States, we continue to observe the market participants’ perception of differences in credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Let me mention finally that ensuring the proper functioning of the overall fiscal framework would be an effective way of contributing to enhance the growth prospects of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">I will now turn to the euro corporate bond market, which has grown considerably since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">While this market had been predominantly open to the highest quality credits, it has since broadened to facilitate the funding needs of riskier issuers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The degree of integration of the euro corporate bond market is reasonably high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.11,0)">Typically, the yield on a corporate bond depends on a number of factors, such as the credit rating, time-to-maturity, liquidity and cash flow structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Our indicators for the state of integration of the euro corporate bond market are based on   models, investigating whether or not risk-adjusted yield spreads have a systematic country component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Our studies suggest that this market segment is fairly integrated in the sense that the country of issuance is only of marginal importance in explaining yield differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Other market segments have even more potential for greater integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">In fact, the euro area equity markets are still quite fragmented, but a gradual integration process is ongoing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">For example, our indicators show that stock prices across the euro area increasingly react to euro area-wide factors and news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Another indicator to measure the degree of integration in euro area equity markets is the relative importance of sector versus country-based investment strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The indicator is derived by calculating and comparing the cross-sector dispersion with the cross-country dispersion of equity returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The more integrated the euro area equity market, the greater the benefits of spreading investments across sectors as opposed to country-based equity investment strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Our statistics show that the elimination of intra-euro area currency risk has encouraged integration in the sense that the “home bias” in the equity holdings of institutional investors has been significantly reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Yet, the country effect is still too important for it to be concluded that the euro area equity market is fully satisfactorily integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">As regards the further integration of securities   markets, a prominent role should be attached to the securities clearing and settlement infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The Eurosystem strongly supports further integration in the securities infrastructure, the lack of which has also been identified by the so-called Giovannini Group as a barrier to integration that should be removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To this end, the ECB takes part in the work of respective expert groups set up by the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Furthermore, in the central bank’s role as a catalyst for collective private-sector activities, meetings are held with representatives from the banking and securities settlement industry of the euro area to discuss the further integration of the euro securities settlement industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">I would also like to highlight the work that we have been carrying out in cooperation with the Committee of European Securities Regulators  : last October we published standards for securities clearing and settlement systems in the EU that aim to adapt international recommendations to the European context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">These ESCB-CESR standards are conducive to the integration of EU capital markets, placing emphasis on common solutions and interoperability between systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Finally, I will move on to the banking markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Here, the degree of integration differs for the various types of banking activities, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.11,0)">capital market-related activities, interbank   activities, and retail banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Cross-border interbank loans and holdings of securities have, in relative terms, experienced substantial growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">While securities issued by non-monetary financial institutions of another euro area country accounted for only 16% of the securities held by euro area monetary financial institutions   at the end of 1997, this share has now reached almost 40%, pointing to a higher degree of capital market integration in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In addition, although loans granted between domestic MFIs still account for more than 50% of the total EU MFI loans, the respective euro area cross-border activity has increased from just 15% at the end of 1997 to around 23% at present  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">And last but not least, integration in retail banking has, by contrast, not progressed to any great extent, as shown by both price and quantity-based indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">For example, while the share of euro area cross-border MFI loans granted to non-MFIs stood at 2% at the end of 1997, this figure has risen to no more than 3.5% today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Moreover, as a price-based indicator, the cross-country standard deviation of interest rates on consumer credit has been rather high and constant, on average 0.9% over the past three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.92,0)">To give a final indicator for the level of retail banking integration, the cross-country dispersion of interest rates on lending for house purchase amounts to, on average, 0.5% over the past three years, with no clear declining trend visible as yet, thus confirming the picture of the not very benign integration of the euro area credit market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Following up on this final indicator regarding the cross-country dispersion of interest rates on lending for house purchase, let me also refer to a few initiatives regarding the further integration of the European mortgage market, which is important with an outstanding volume of more than €4 trillion in residential mortgage debt that corresponds to around 40% of EU GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">As the European Commission announced in its recent White Paper on Financial Services Policy 2005-2010 , where, among others, the further integration of retail markets in Europe has been targeted, it will release a White Paper this year on mortgage credit in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">With its earlier public consultation on this matter, the European Commission has launched a broad discussion about the possible benefits and ways of further integrating European mortgage markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The Eurosystem believes that this kind of investigation into the possible benefits of and obstacles to the further integration of European mortgage markets is warranted, and the Eurosystem published its observations in a recent contribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">More generally, this contribution can also be seen as an example of the Eurosystem’s role in providing advice on shaping the legislative and regulatory framework for the financial system to be conducive to financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">And as with securities markets, retail markets also need an integrated infrastructure in order to reap the full benefits of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.42,0)">European citizens’ cross-border banking activities, such as mortgage credit, also depend on the further developments in and costs of cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">In this respect, let me mention, as a final example of our contribution to fostering financial integration, the Eurosystem’s support, together with the European Commission, for the banking industry’s initiative to create a Single Euro Payments Area  , with which European citizens should be able to make payments throughout the euro area from a single bank account, and using a single set of payment instruments, as easily and safely as in the national context today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Acting as a catalyst for private-sector activities, the ECB actively supports this initiative by the European Payments Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">High-level coordination takes place between the Eurosystem and the banking industry, and the ECB has arranged a number of meetings involving SEPA end-users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">A large amount of work still lies ahead, for which we count on the industry’s commitment to deliver the results of the SEPA project as foreseen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">In this respect, I recall that the first SEPA milestone is that, by 2008, in parallel to national instruments, banks should provide to customers also SEPA instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">A second milestone involves that national infrastructures migrate to a pan-European payments infrastructure, via complete interoperability between SEPA compliant infrastructures, by the end of 2010, so that full competition applies to all euro area infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">* * * Ladies and gentlemen, dear students, An analysis of the state of European financial integration and the monitoring of its progress over time are prerequisites for possible action in those fields where the analysis has identified gaps and shortcomings, in order to reap the full economic benefits from financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Given today’s event and the number of students I see in the audience, let me also mention that the “raw” data and time series underlying our indicators are published on the ECB’s website and can therefore be accessed and used by all interested parties who would like to work in this fascinating area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">I strongly encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity and to make your contribution to our understanding in this important area of research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Events such as the Campus for Finance are very important to enhance the dialogue between academics and practitioners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">European financial integration, in which the ECB has such a strong interest, is indeed one area where academics and practitioners could usefully benefit from closer cooperation.</span>
