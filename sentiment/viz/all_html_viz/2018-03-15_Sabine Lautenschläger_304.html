    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.64,0)"> The banks and the market Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Lecture at the Florence School of Banking and Finance, Florence, 15 March 2018 Almost ten years ago to the day, the world of finance was shaken by a strong tremor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">On 16 March 2008, JP Morgan offered to buy the investment bank Bear Stearns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And it was time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.75,0)">Bear Stearns was in deep trouble: its share price had fallen by two-thirds since the beginning of that year; it was bleeding money; and it was basically shut out of the funding market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.1,0)">At the time, the failure of Bear Sterns was considered a major event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.35,0)">No one knew that the big quake was still to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.08,0)">It happened half a year later, on 15 September 2008, when another investment bank failed: Lehman Brothers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.52,0)">It pushed the financial system close to the abyss.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.48,0)">Trust evaporated, markets dried up, and around the globe, banks were sent reeling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.36,0)">All in all, it was the biggest financial crisis in decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.94,0)">It dragged down the real economy, which fell into what we now call the Great Recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.37,0)">In the euro area, economic output went down by almost 4.5% in 2009, while unemployment jumped by more than a quarter to 9.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Three years later, it reached 12%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.6,0)">In Italy, for instance, output fell by more than 5% in 2009, while unemployment peaked at almost 13% in 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.63,0)">These figures are alarming, but they tell us little about the people who lost their jobs, their homes and their future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.16,0)">Taking all this suffering into account, the crisis turned into a tragedy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.52,0)">As for its causes, I admit that the story I’ve just told is far too simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.42,0)">Of course, it was not the failure of a single investment bank that caused all this mayhem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.45,0)">The full story is much longer and much more complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">However, no one can deny that banks played a crucial role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.36,0)">It became obvious that they can pose a huge risk to financial stability and the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But at the same it’s an inescapable truth that we need banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Or, to be more precise, we need the services they provide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Why we need banks Who does an investor turn to when she needs money to start or expand a business, when she needs to hedge risks or wants to acquire another company?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.03,0)">Who does a saver turn to when he wants to deposit money?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.99,0)">Who does a family turn to when it needs a loan to buy a home?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Here in Europe, all of them would most likely turn to a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Banks provide a vital service to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.59,0)">Without them, the economy would not work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">All this leads us to a crucial question: how can we ensure that banks reliably serve the economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Long taken for granted, this has become the holy grail of banking regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">And it has become the ultimate goal of all the relevant reforms that have been undertaken since the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">And much has been done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">We have revamped the global standards for capital and liquidity – Basel III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Rules for banks are now much stronger than they were before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And the same is true for supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Just think of European banking supervision, which was set up in 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">All this will help to make banks more resilient, so that they can reliably serve the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.99,0)">But there is one thing which neither rules nor supervisors can do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.38,0)">They cannot prevent each and every bank from failing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.85,0)">And in my view, we should not even try to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.05,0)">The possibility of failure is inherent to any kind of business, and it is a core element of well-functioning market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.97,0)">No, it is not the job of supervisors to keep individual banks alive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.94,0)">We, in particular, must not lower our standards to cater for the weakest bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.39,0)">It would also be wrong to assume that each bank, even the weakest, just needs time to sort itself out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It would be wrong to assume that the local economy just needs to grow for a few more years for the bank to recover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.45,0)">The result would be weak banks that stagger on, zombie-like, barely able to survive in good times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.31,0)">In short: such supervisory forbearance distorts the market and weakens the entire banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.21,0)">Supervisors would become part of the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Obviously, we shouldn’t overdo it either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">If justified, banks should always have reasonable time to comply with new rules and standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">Think, for instance, of the transitional phases for the Basel framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But the standards themselves should not be weakened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">All this leads us to an interesting conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.61,0)">Obviously, it was a problem that banks failed during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.64,0)">But taking a long-term view, I would argue that it was also a problem that many weak and under-capitalised banks that did not have a viable business model did not fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">They did not fail prior to the crisis – even though they probably should have – and they could not fail during the crisis either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.03,0)">But not letting banks fail creates some huge problems further down the road.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.75,0)">Let’s discuss why banks should be able to fail, but often were not able to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.0,0)">Why banks must be able to fail   Why was it that in the past banks were often not allowed to fail?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.53,0)">The answer is simple: the failure of a bank can trigger a financial earthquake.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.2,0)">Banks engage in maturity transformation: they accept short-term deposits and make longer-term loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.7,0)">Banks depend on public trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.18,0)">If that trust disappears, they may suffer a bank run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.04,0)">And that can affect the stability of the whole system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This happens because banks are highly interconnected – either directly or indirectly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.67,0)">The failure of one bank may trigger the failure of other banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.46,0)">Such contagion can occur by banks being exposed to each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.93,0)">When a bank defaults on its debt, creditor banks suffer direct financial losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.13,0)">But contagion can also be more subtle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.4,0)">The failure of a bank may cause investors and depositors to wonder about the health of other banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.49,0)">Trust then evaporates and funding sources dry up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.18,0)">Even sound banks might find themselves in the midst of a liquidity crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.3,0)">This is what happened in the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.28,0)">Either way, a bank’s failure can infect the entire banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And in this respect some banks are considered to be riskier than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.51,0)">I am talking about banks that are big, complex, interconnected, and which cannot easily be replaced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.08,0)">Their failure can disrupt financial stability big time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Such banks are systemically important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.62,0)">If they fail, the financial system can grind to a halt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.36,0)">And not only that: the flow of credit stops, investment and consumption stall, and jobs are destroyed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.08,0)">The social costs can be huge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.69,0)">To prevent all this from happening, governments have repeatedly bailed out systemically important banks with public money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.2,0)">Even medium-sized banks were bailed out for fear of contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">But the short-term gain of preserving financial stability comes at a great cost in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.31,0)">The belief that banks would be bailed out whatever the cost created bad incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Banks got used to an implicit and costless government guarantee, which kicked in when things went wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.68,0)">Sound and prudent management was often considered less important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Banks could boost their profitability by investing in riskier assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">That way, they could reap higher returns, knowing that the risks would be borne by others, by taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.84,0)">And neither shareholders nor investors provided the necessary checks and balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.81,0)">They lacked incentives to monitor banks’ risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.01,0)">They often expected outsized returns, knowing that the banks would need to take equally outsized risks to earn these returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.21,0)">But they didn’t care too much; investors too lived in a world where profits were gained by the few but losses were imposed on the many.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.31,0)">Funding costs of systemic banks were too low, which allowed them to grow even larger, making them “too big to fail”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.84,0)">At the end of the day, banks and their investors had little incentive to act in a sustainable and forward-looking manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.73,0)">So banks must be able to fail for all the reasons I just mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.16,0)">Making banks fail again When’s the right time?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Against this backdrop, the aim of all the regulatory reforms was not just to make banks more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.56,0)">They also aimed to make banks fail again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.83,0)">But don’t get me wrong here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.99,0)">Failure is the least desirable option, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Above all, we need healthy and well-functioning banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.37,0)">But still, sometimes banks do fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">And to ensure that they can do so in an orderly manner, a European resolution mechanism has been devised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.54,0)">It defines the tools and the institutional set-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It forms the second pillar of the banking union alongside European banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.93,0)">But again, resolving a bank is just the very last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Thus, the new framework becomes applicable long before a bank fails.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.04,0)">It requires banks, for instance, to draw up recovery plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In these plans, the banks set out how they would overcome severe crises using their own resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Now, recovery plans are drawn up when the going is good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">When times are tough, the new framework offers some more tools, including early intervention measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.65,0)">Supervisors can use them if they see that a bank is about to get into trouble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.49,0)">The idea is to be intrusive and to make the bank officially aware of the supervisor’s serious concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">This helps to get the bank back on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Early intervention measures can be an important tool to prevent bank failures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In practice, however, it is challenging to use them, for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">First, because they overlap with some of our standard tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">To give you just one example, asking a bank for a capital plan can be either a standard supervisory tool or an early intervention measure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.86,0)">This overlap is a challenge as it often prevents us from applying early intervention tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We are bound to use the least intrusive tool, which is always the standard one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We always have to take into account the costs and benefits of our measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Assume that the supervisor, as an early intervention measure, asks the bank to draw up a capital plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.58,0)">The bank might then be required to disclose this request to the markets as it shows that the supervisor is seriously concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.76,0)">This might erode trust in the bank and, in the worst case, trigger a bank run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.15,0)">This would bring about the very crisis that the supervisor wanted to prevent in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.73,0)">If an early intervention measure does more harm to the bank than it does good, supervisors might be obliged not to apply the measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Instead, they could ask for the same thing, but frame it as a standard tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.66,0)">In that case, the bank would still have to draw up the capital plan, but would probably not need to disclose the request to the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Hence, the standard supervisory tools can be considered as less intrusive than the early intervention tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">So the overlap between the two tools should be removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">There should be a clearly defined set of standard tools and early intervention measures and a clearly defined escalation process leading from one to the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.55,0)">The second reason why it is challenging to use early intervention measures is because those measures are defined in the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive, or BRRD.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.61,0)">And as the BRRD is an EU directive, it has to be transposed into national law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.91,0)">The ECB must thus exercise its powers based on the national transpositions; and these vary from country to country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.1,0)">This creates uncertainty and inconsistency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">What we thus need is a harmonised legal basis from which we can apply early intervention measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Now, let’s go one step further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.03,0)">Imagine our bank gets into more serious trouble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In this scenario, there is one tool that helps to create a bit of breathing space for the bank and the authorities to sort things out – a moratorium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.76,0)">A moratorium allows the authorities to suspend all the activities of a bank for a short period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.67,0)">In a sense, it freezes time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A moratorium helps to manage a crisis in an orderly manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">It gives the bank and its shareholders time to find a solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is particularly useful during a sudden liquidity crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.65,0)">However, there is a practical problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.97,0)">Moratoriums are not part of the European toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.86,0)">In some countries they do exist; in others, they don’t.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.01,0)">And in any case, they are not harmonised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.27,0)">We need harmonised, short-term moratoriums in all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.3,0)">If, for instance, a cross-border bank gets into trouble, the supervisor in that bank’s home country can impose a moratorium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.26,0)">But what if the bank has a subsidiary in a country where only a court could impose a moratorium?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.08,0)">What if the bank has a subsidiary in a country where a moratorium cannot be imposed at all?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.42,0)">This is a serious stumbling block for crisis management at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.25,0)">This obstacle has to be removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.33,0)">Let’s return to our bank and assume that nothing helps and that the situation goes from bad to worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.57,0)">At some point, the bank will have to be declared “failing or likely to fail”, to use a bit of jargon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.04,0)">This is mostly done by the supervisors, and it is the most intrusive thing we can do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.3,0)">Declaring a bank “failing or likely to fail” has far-reaching consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.7,0)">It is a difficult decision which requires a delicate balancing act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.48,0)">As long as there is a reasonable chance of the bank recovering, a “failing or likely to fail” decision would put an undue financial burden on the shareholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.6,0)">But if the decision is put off for too long, the costs of an imminent failure start to mount up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.29,0)">This would hurt creditors and depositors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.19,0)">In extreme cases, it might even become a threat to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.77,0)">So, the “failing or likely to fail” decision must neither be taken too early, nor too late.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And in any case, it must be taken with great care.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.5,0)">There are four general cases which call for a “failing or likely to fail” decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Some of these cases are quite clear-cut and can be objectively assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.18,0)">Others are a bit less clear-cut – particularly when they refer to things that are likely to or might happen in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.53,0)">Thus, there is some room for discretion when determining whether a bank is failing or likely to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.68,0)">After all, each bank fails in its own way, so each case is different, and each decision needs to account for these differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We need to take all facts into account and assess them case by case, and not against a single yardstick.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In short, we must be proportionate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.41,0)">Imagine a bank breaches capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.37,0)">Then we have to ask how severe that breach is and whether it might just be temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.4,0)">If it’s just a marginal breach which could be healed within a reasonable period of time, it might not be proportionate to declare the bank “failing or likely to fail”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We also need to take into account that a bank depends on the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.88,0)">So how do they react?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.27,0)">A bank in trouble might quickly lose the trust of the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.87,0)">This could lead to a bank run, which requires supervisors to act differently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.15,0)">So, to sum up: “failing or likely to fail” decisions are not taken automatically but are based on expert judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">At the same time, they have to be taken case by case and in a proportionate manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.54,0)">All in all, they are the most difficult decisions a supervisor has to take.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And I can assure you that we do not take them lightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.72,0)">How to resolve a bank Imagine that we have declared a bank failing or likely to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.39,0)">What happens next?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.36,0)">Well, at that point the resolution authority takes over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.7,0)">In Europe, this is the Single Resolution Board, or SRB for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The SRB then has to answer two basic questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">First: are there any measures, private or otherwise, that could restore the viability of the bank?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.66,0)">If the answer to this question is “no”, the second question is: should the bank be resolved or liquidated?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.01,0)">And the answer to this question depends on a number of things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The objective should always be to ensure that the financial system is not disrupted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">If the bank performs critical functions, these need to be continued one way or another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.19,0)">In addition, measures need to be taken to prevent the bank from “infecting” other banks or the markets in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And finally, public funds and the bank’s insured depositors, for instance, need to be protected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">So, it is crucial to conduct what we call a “public interest test”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">If all these goals can be met by liquidating the bank, then that’s what will happen under national insolvency law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.25,0)">And this is something of a weak spot, because these laws still differ significantly across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">A minimum level of harmonisation is thus called for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.36,0)">In particular, the triggers for “failing or likely to fail” decisions and for liquidations need to be aligned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.73,0)">If they are not, banks that are deemed failing or likely to fail according to European rules might not be deemed as such under national insolvency laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.27,0)">This is obviously a huge stumbling block to the harmonised treatment of bank failures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.05,0)">If liquidating the bank has the potential to disrupt the financial system and therefore the public interest test is positive, the bank will be resolved at the European level instead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The SRB has various tools at its disposal for this and they are laid out in the relevant legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">All these tools ensure that a bank can fail in an orderly manner without disrupting the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">And this is the overarching goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.3,0)">Who foots the bill?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.9,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, I have talked about the decision to declare that a bank is failing or likely to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.08,0)">And I have talked about what happens after such a decision is taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.8,0)">The next thing I will talk about is money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.4,0)">Bank failures are costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.37,0)">So who foots the bill?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">“Not the taxpayers” is the first and most important answer I can give you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">After all, the main objective of the new framework is to spare taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.49,0)">Instead, it should be the owners and creditors who bear the losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I have already explained the reasoning behind this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But how does it work in practice?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.86,0)">The first thing to mention is that banks now have to hold more equity than they did before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">This means that each bank has a larger buffer to absorb losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.9,0)">And these losses are borne by those who provided the equity, the shareholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">So, higher equity means that the owners of a bank bear a larger share of any losses incurred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.8,0)">At the same time, failure becomes less likely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.6,0)">And if the bank does fail and needs to be resolved, there is the bail-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The bail-in is one of the SRB’s resolution tools, and it ensures that the burden of failure is indeed borne by the owners and creditors of a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The bail-in establishes what you might call a hierarchy of loss-bearers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.27,0)">First in line are shareholders, followed by holders of subordinated debt, followed by other creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.2,0)">The question is, of course: how much can be bailed in?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.55,0)">And the answer is: everything!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Well, in theory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In practice, there is a safeguard: the Single Resolution Fund, or SRF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The SRF is financed by banks from all 19 euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It was set up in 2016, and by 2023, it should amount to about €55 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In a resolution, the SRF can contribute up to 5% of the bank’s balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.41,0)">But it can only do so after shareholders and creditors have borne losses amounting to at least 8% of the bank’s total balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">So, shareholders and creditors have to bear a large part of the losses first, and then the banking industry as a whole can step in through the SRF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The basic idea of bail-in is quite clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.65,0)">But, as is so often the case, the devil is in the detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.86,0)">However, I will spare you that particular discussion and turn to three more general questions related to bail-ins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.3,0)">A bail-in ensures that losses are borne by the owners and creditors of a bank, by those who took the risk and earned the return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.25,0)">So the first question is: what if they were not aware – or were not made aware – of the risks they were taking?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.84,0)">For it is sometimes the case that retail investors are among those who are bailed in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.66,0)">These are not professional investors but ordinary people who were trying to build up funds for retirement, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.15,0)">For such people, a bail-in is not just a financial loss; it is a personal tragedy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.53,0)">We must avoid such tragedies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">But we must do so in a way which is in line with the basic idea of bail-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.93,0)">And this is as much a question of consumer protection as of financial education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In terms of consumer protection, we need disclosure requirements which are clear and easy to understand so that all investors are aware of the risks they are taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In terms of financial education, we must ensure that all investors have a basic understanding of finance, and in particular of the relationship between risk and return.In both areas, I see a lot of room for improvement in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And there’s more we can do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We could set a minimum threshold of €100,000 for investing in subordinated debt instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">This too would help to steer retail investors away from risky financial endeavours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Here, we would need a European approach, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.92,0)">If each country were to go its own way, the market for the relevant financial instruments would become too fragmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The ECB welcomes current proposals which foresee the introduction of non-preferred senior debt instruments and a general depositor preference rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">This would further facilitate bail-ins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.64,0)">The second question is: what happens if the Single Resolution Fund runs out of money?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.44,0)">What if there’s a major crisis, and the €55 billion is not enough to cover the losses?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Well, in such a situation we would need a common European backstop for the SRF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">And we need it quickly, and in any case before 2023, which is when the SRF will reach its target volume.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">European leaders committed to this when setting up the SRF, and they should stick to their commitment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The backstop could take the form of a direct credit line from the European Stability Mechanism to the SRF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The important thing is that it can provide both solvency and liquidity support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.46,0)">And now to the third and final question: has public support for failing banks really become a thing of the past?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">“Almost” is the answer to this question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.08,0)">And the rules are now such that any public support for a bank in fact triggers a “failing or likely to fail” decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.54,0)">There are a few exceptions, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">One of these is known as precautionary recapitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It allows governments to recapitalise banks using public funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.28,0)">But the scope for this kind of state aid is very narrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">First, it is only available to solvent banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Second, it can only be used to cover capital shortfalls which were identified in the adverse scenario of a stress test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.13,0)">And third, it can only be of a precautionary and temporary nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.49,0)">In other words, it must not be used to cover losses which the bank has already incurred or is likely to incur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.53,0)">I will highlight just one issue here which relates to the role of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">With regard to the first condition, it is up to the ECB to confirm whether the bank in question is solvent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It has some discretion here, as the European legal framework does not offer a specific definition of solvency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">So it is crucial that we have a consistent definition of solvency – a definition that not just covers a point in time but takes a forward-looking perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.43,0)">Even if a bank is solvent today, it might not be so in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.28,0)">In the end, it is the European Commission that grants or denies permission for precautionary recapitalisation, as state aid rules apply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Among other things, this entails burden-sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Shareholders, as well as holders of hybrid and subordinated debt, must contribute to reducing the capital shortfall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This ensures that the burden of failure is still borne by those who took the risk and reaped the return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Spotting problems and keeping them from mounting up Given the limited time we have, I have given you a very brief overview of what resolving a bank entails.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.81,0)">It is a gruesome and complex event, and one which is best avoided, but not at all costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.85,0)">To avoid failure, banks and supervisors must spot problems early on and address them quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Since the crisis, stress tests have become an important tool for helping us to do this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Stress tests basically assess how banks would fare in various hypothetical scenarios involving different future paths for the economy and the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Usually, there is a baseline scenario, where things develop as expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.94,0)">And then there is an adverse scenario, where they don’t: inter alia, GDP, unemployment and property prices are stressed two years ahead in this scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">So you can see that the key idea of a stress test is to assess how banks would cope if the going gets tough; it’s all purely hypothetical, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Stress tests allow us to make a consistent assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Each bank has to apply the same scenarios and calculate their impact in the same way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">This means that the results can be compared across banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">And stress tests provide a glimpse of the bank’s risk management in action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">How quickly can it process the scenarios and assess their impact on   the bank?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is important information about the quality of governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.38,0)">But the main focus of stress tests is on capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Do the banks have enough capital to absorb any losses in either scenario?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.32,0)">And the crucial question that follows is, of course: what if they don’t?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Well, let’s take a brief look at the upcoming stress test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This year, the European Banking Authority, EBA for short, will conduct a stress test involving the largest banks in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This test includes 37 banks from the euro area which are directly supervised by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">To obtain a fuller picture, we will, in parallel, stress-test most of the remaining large banks in the euro area, using the same scenarios and methods as the EBA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.14,0)">In respect of capital shortfalls, the stress test is not a pass-or-fail exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.39,0)">The banks do not have to meet certain thresholds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.86,0)">Instead, we supervisors will decide on a case-by-case basis whether banks have a capital shortfall, taking into account their individual risk profiles and their individual capital needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.28,0)">At the end of the day, stress tests may deal with hypothetical scenarios, but their results can have very real consequences for the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">They inform the work of supervisors, and they inform market expectations when the results are published, as they will be in the case of the EBA’s stress test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">They are also a moment of truth for the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.44,0)">More generally, stress tests help supervisors and banks to spot and remove weak points in banks’ resilience early on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.59,0)">If this is not done, problems can quickly mount up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.27,0)">A current example are bad loans, or to use a more technical term, non-performing loans, NPLs for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Banks in the euro area carry a total of €760 billion in such loans on their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.13,0)">And this is an issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.43,0)">Having large stocks of NPLs on their balance sheets prevents banks from doing their job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.53,0)">They have a hard time financing our economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.24,0)">ECB internal research has shown that banks with high stocks of NPLs indeed lend less than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It is thus important that banks resolve their NPLs quickly and decisively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And this is not just for the sake of the economy and the greater good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.76,0)">Failing to deal with NPLs also hurts the banks themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.43,0)">High levels of NPLs require constant attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And this takes time and energy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">So getting rid of NPLs would enable managers and staff to use their time more productively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">They could improve business models, shore up profits and make their bank more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.16,0)">So, failing to deal with NPLs hurts the economy and of course it hurts the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">That’s why we consider NPLs a top priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Getting rid of NPLs by restructuring, working out or selling them requires a joint effort by banks, politicians and supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Banks have to put in place the right strategies and execute them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Politicians have to improve the judicial and legal systems to allow a swift resolution of NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And we supervisors?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Well, last year we published guidance on how to deal with NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">On the basis of that guidance, we scrutinise the banks’ strategies and provide feedback.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">So we are keeping a close eye on how banks are addressing the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And today, we have published an addendum to our guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This addendum will help to ensure that NPLs remain a problem of the past once they have been dealt with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">To that end, it lays out how we expect banks to provision for new NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.94,0)">More specifically, it refers to exposures that are newly classified as non-performing as of 1 April 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The addendum is not a binding document, but it specifies our expectations and will thus serve as a starting point for our dialogue with each bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, Rest assured that I have not exhausted the topic of my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.4,0)">But I may well have exhausted you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.16,0)">So I will conclude quickly and painlessly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">First, banks are important for the economy, particularly here in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">That said, it might be good to add a bit more capital market to the mix; but that is a topic for another day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.83,0)">Second, banks must be able to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.54,0)">If they are not, the economy will suffer in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But if banks fail, they must do so in an orderly manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.39,0)">If not, financial stability will suffer in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">The new European resolution framework helps to make orderly failure possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.37,0)">Third, failure is the least desirable outcome, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">We need banks which are profitable and resilient in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Stronger regulation and supervision can do their bit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In the end, however, it is up to the banks themselves to ensure they lead long and healthy lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.76,0)">And with these three messages this long speech comes to an end.</span>
