    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)"> Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,Brussels, 23 September 2013 Madam Chair, Honourable members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, It is a pleasure for me to be back with your committee, shortly after the important vote of your assembly on the SSM regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">This vote has been preceded by intense interaction on the interinstitutional agreement on accountability and transparency, and I would like to thank President Schulz, your Committee and the negotiating team for the commitment to a successful establishment of the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Our two institutions share a common interest in a swift and effective implementation of banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The draft inter-institutional agreement ensures high standards of transparency and accountability, while safeguarding the protection of confidential information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">We will continue working with a similar constructive spirit in the months ahead and hope that this will allow a swift set-up of the Supervisory Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Today, I will first review recent economic and monetary developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I will then address the two topics that you have selected for our discussion: the impact of our non-standard measures; and the new tasks of the ECB in the reformed EMU architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Economic and monetary developments Since our meeting in July we have received positive data for the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Following six quarters of negative output growth, euro area real GDP rose by 0.3%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Measures of confidence and surveys of production have given some support to the view that euro area economic activity should continue its slow recovery in the current quarter, despite weak production data for July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Looking forward, economic activity should benefit from a gradual improvement in domestic demand, supported by the ECB’s accommodative monetary policy stance and strengthening external demand for euro area exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">However, unemployment in the euro area remains far too high, and the recovery will need to be firmly established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.39,0)">Annual euro area inflation declined to 1.3% in August 2013, down from 1.6% in July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Underlying price pressures are expected to remain subdued, reflecting the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand and the modest pace of the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Medium to long-term inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored in line with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be still broadly balanced over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Monetary and, in particular, credit dynamics remain subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.48,0)">The annual rate of change of loans to the private sector and, notably, to firms weakened further in July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.28,0)">Weak loan dynamics continue to reflect the current stage of the business cycle but also heightened credit risk and the ongoing adjustments in the balance sheets of borrowers and lenders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The significant improvement in the funding situation of banks since the summer of 2012 has not yet fed through into higher credit provision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Review of recent monetary policy decisions Against this background, the Governing Council has pledged to maintain monetary policy accommodative for as long as necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In order to re-affirm and clarify this conditional pledge, in a context of volatile money market interest rates, the ECB has introduced forward guidance in July, stating that it expects the key ECB interest rates to remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">This expectation, which has been reconfirmed in August and September, is based on a subdued outlook for inflation extending into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the economy and subdued monetary dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">We will maintain the degree of monetary accommodation warranted by the outlook for price stability and aim at promoting stable money market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">To ensure an adequate transmission of monetary policy to the financing conditions in the broader economy, it is essential that effective measures be taken to further reduce fragmentation of euro area credit markets and to strengthen the resilience of banks where needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Monetary policy contributes to these objectives, but it can only address impairments in transmission insofar as they are not related to more structural barriers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">By giving unlimited access to central bank refinancing against adequate collateral, our non-standard measures have been pivotal in relieving bank funding stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The collateral framework has been adjusted as necessary to ensure continued adequate risk protection for the ECB’s balance sheet, while at the same time promoting transparency, for example in markets for structured finance products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.87,0)">Ensuring that solvent banks remain liquid has contributed to avoiding an abrupt deleveraging which would have deeply damaged the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The Outright Monetary Transactions   announced a year ago have prevented risks of destructive scenarios with potentially severe challenges for price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">OMTs serve as a fully effective backstop, within the ECB’s mandate, and under formal conditionality so as to preserve the appropriate incentives for governments to ensure fiscal solvency and adopt those structural policies that can put the economy on a sustainable path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Over the past twelve months, confidence in the euro area has returned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">As a consequence, fragmentation in euro area funding markets has been receding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This improvement owes not only to the ECB’s non-standard measures, but also to progress by governments in improving the euro area governance and in pursuing reform agendas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Deposit outflows from stressed countries have been reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Market access for banks has improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.85,0)">Reliance on ECB funding support has been steadily declining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">These improvements are reflected primarily in the on-going advance repayments of funds by several banks which had borrowed from the ECB under the two three-year longer-term refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.19,0)">While repayment of central bank credit is certainly a sign of normalisation, the resulting reduction in excess liquidity can reinforce upward pressures on term money market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">We will remain particularly attentive to the implications that these developments may have for the stance of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The tasks of the ECB in the reformed EMU architecture Let me finally address the tasks of the ECB in the reformed EMU architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The Maastricht set-up has been substantially strengthened since the start of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Europe has reinforced fiscal and macroeconomic surveillance, created a permanent crisis management mechanism, the ESM, and has improved its institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">It is moving swiftly towards the Single Supervisory Mechanism   for banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">A key priority of the agenda for the last quarter of 2013 is to complement it by a Single Resolution Authority and Single Resolution Fund as proposed by the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The ECB strongly supports the envisaged timeline for the establishment of the SRM by 1 January 2015, which adequately reflects the urgency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Let me make a few remarks on the specific role of the ECB in the progress towards a fully-fledged banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Already in 2010, with the decisive contribution of your institution, the ESRB was created to oversee macro-prudential risks in the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The ECB ensures the Secretariat and thereby provides support to the ESRB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">This year, a further-reaching step is being made with the imminent launch of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The ECB is fully committed to assume its new responsibilities and to discharge accountability accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Preparatory work has started in order to ensure that the new tasks are performed at the highest level of effectiveness and professionalism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">While synergies between the new supervisory and existing monetary policy functions exist, the ECB will strictly respect the principle of separation between monetary policy and banking supervision, as foreseen in the SSM Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Such separation will ensure that the ECB will continue to fulfil its primary mandate of price stability in complete independence, in line with the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The effective separation of monetary policy and bank supervision decisions will be implemented both at the decision making level and at the technical staff level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">A separate Supervisory Board will be created to draft and enforce decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.55,0)">Furthermore, deliberations of the Governing Council on supervisory matters will be strictly separated from monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This separation between the two tasks will be underpinned by separated agendas and meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Finally, let me say a few words on the involvement of the ECB in the troika.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Back in 2010, we were asked by the Council to provide our technical expertise to the design and monitoring of EU/IMF financial assistance programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In the meantime, the ECB has been allocated a number of specific tasks by the ESM Treaty and EU secondary legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We act in liaison with the Commission to provide technical advice, based on our expertise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">As we have done in the past, we remain ready to share our views on the situation in programme countries with the European Parliament and to explain the advice provided as part of the troika.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">However, it is important to recall that the Eurogroup is the body which actually decides whether to grant financial assistance and under which terms.</span>
