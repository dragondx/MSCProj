    <span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)"> Time to act: clear objectives and a convincing roadmap for the Single Euro Payments Area Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBSpeech delivered at the Strategy off-site meeting of the Co-ordination Committee of the European Payments Council in Durbuy on 6 September 2004 Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much for inviting me here to present the ECB’s views on the Single Euro Payments Area – SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">For me, SEPA should be seen as an important contribution to the financial integration of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The introduction of the euro has created the necessary conditions for such an integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The success of the single currency would be incomplete if it were not underpinned by integrated payment systems, money and capital markets and a financial industry providing its services to a single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Moreover, the consolidation of the financial sector is essential if Europe is to meet its goal, as stated in the Lisbon agenda, of becoming the world’s most competitive and dynamic economy by 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The need to increase competitiveness poses a particular challenge for European banks, where the cost/income ratio is currently around 65%, compared with 60% in the US in 1996 and 50% now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.95,0)">The ECB’s observer at the European Payments Council Plenary, Mr De Geest, has informed me that the town you have chosen for this meeting, Durbuy in the Belgian Ardennes, is the world’s smallest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">However, I also learnt that this medieval town was, at one time, both protected and isolated from the world outside by its walls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">I also found out that it voluntarily decided to merge with neighbouring villages in 1977.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Thus, it was more important for its citizens to move beyond their borders and to become part of a wider community than to remain the world’s smallest town.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This process has many parallels with European integration: together we are stronger, and together we benefit from opening up our borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The ECB strongly supports your efforts and, like you, prefers a significant role for self-regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This needs to be credible, though.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Therefore, I consider this a crucial moment for the EPC to give fresh momentum to SEPA by reconfirming and clarifying its objectives for SEPA, as laid down in the White Paper, and by following up on the objectives with a concrete action plan and a clear timetable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As you know, the Eurosystem is currently preparing its third progress report on retail payments, to be published in October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">It will assess how well the banks’ project to establish SEPA by 2010 is advancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Our analysis and assessment may well be influenced by the results of your SEPA strategy discussion, and may depend on what you achieve here in the next few days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.43,0)">This is also why we have postponed publication of the progress report from July until October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.43,0)">The first part of my presentation today concentrates on the “what?” and the “why?” questions: what is the real meaning of SEPA?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">What are its benefits?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Why should it be achieved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To clarify these issues, I will distinguish between what SEPA means for the citizens   and what it means for you, the industry  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In the second part of my presentation, I would like to share some ideas with you on how to achieve SEPA, on what I perceive as the necessary steps on the way to SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">My purpose is to encourage a dialogue on how best to achieve the objectives and benefits we are pursuing with SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">You have already shown that you can deliver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Work on a great number of issues has moved forward: you have set up the EPC and its sub-structures, you have agreed on conventions for the Credeuro, the first Pan-European Automated Clearing House is working.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.85,0)">But there is no clear plan yet on how to go ahead with the entire project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.11,0)">National communities do not yet fully understand or sufficiently support the project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It is not really clear how the EPC could implement and enforce decisions taken within a regime of self-regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.76,0)">Some work items have been delayed and there seems to be no full agreement yet on the ultimate objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.15,0)">1 What does SEPA mean?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In the White Paper, the EPC expressed the SEPA objective as having payments within SEPA made by everybody “as easily and inexpensively as in his or her hometown”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.99,0)">What does this really mean for a citizen of Durbuy or any other euro area citizen?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">It means that a real SEPA is achieved when people can make payments throughout the whole euro area from one bank account, or by using one card, as easily and safely as a national payment is conducted today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">For the customer in the euro area, the choice of bank or location of account should make no difference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The citizen’s perspective of SEPA accords with the Eurosystem’s vision, which is that all euro area payments should become domestic, and reach a level of safety and efficiency at least comparable with the best-performing national payment systems today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.55,0)">The EC Regulation on cross-border payments in euro has reduced prices on cross-border payments to the level of equivalent domestic payments, but does not go far enough to reach a SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.98,0)">Customers cannot choose one account and one card for the entire euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.56,0)">Standards and business practices vary from one euro area country to another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.22,0)">Products, forms, and services still differ and in most cases are limited by national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">In this respect, it is important to recall the benefits of SEPA: enhanced services for all your private and commercial customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The Euro-Associations of Corporate Treasurers   have informed the ECB about the substantial efficiency gains that SEPA could bring about as a result of fully automated processing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.87,0)">It is estimated that fully processing an invoice in corporations with large paper-based processes costs between €35 and €60.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Full automation could reduce this by 70-90%   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Approximately one-third of these savings could be obtained in the reconciliation process with the help of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">When SEPA is fully achieved, a corporation will only need one electronic link to the bank of its choice in order to send all payments and receive all bank statements in one standardised format.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me now explain what SEPA means for the banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For the ECB it is not possible to accept a SEPA which consists of two parallel infrastructures: a national one and a cross-border one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This would preserve the existing fragmented payment infrastructure, which is a relic of the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">It would be supplemented by an infrastructure supporting the cross-border business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The ECB cannot believe that the large number of national automated clearing houses   constitute an economic optimum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">However, the ECB is not advocating one single European automated clearing house.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">The euro area is big enough for several competing pan-European ACHs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.61,0)">Therefore, the ECB is concerned that no pan-European ACH has gained critical mass so far, and that there are still no clear signs of integration among the fragmented national infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">More generally, the ECB is encouraging the banking industry to embrace the dual opportunity of financial integration – offered and catalysed by the euro – and of technological progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">These two exogenous drivers should be used to enhance the supply of banking services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">For benchmarks we only need to look at the Nordic countries, where the e-readiness is most developed in Europe and where e-invoicing is being implemented with the support of public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Your SEPA project will make you fit for the future if your vision incorporates these kind of ambitious benchmarks to introduce new competitive services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">2 How can SEPA be achieved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I now turn the second part of my presentation, the ‘how’ question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Achieving SEPA first of all means that the different payment instruments, such as credit transfers, direct debits and cards, must become pan-European.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.11,0)">I’m leaving cash out of consideration since people in the euro area already use the same notes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.92,0)">However, if we examine these instruments one by one we will find that the euro area is still far from being a domestic payment area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Credit transfers For credit transfers there is a standard called Credeuro, but this is only applicable to cross-border credit transfers up to €12,500.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">National transfers still follow national standards and business practices that are highly automated and efficient, but incompatible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Therefore, the unanswered question – and the EPC has not developed a convincing strategy on this yet – is how to turn Credeuro into a basic credit transfer service for all euro area-wide domestic retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">One necessary element here would be to harmonise the different local standards for the customer-bank interface by defining a single standard for electronic payment initiation and automated reconciliation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This would truly enable Credeuro to become the single standard for end-to-end credit transfers in SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In addition, it would be necessary to complement Credeuro with a service for same-day value payments   in order to achieve a level of service at least on a par with that of the best-performing national markets today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Therefore, the ECB wishes to remind the EPC of the objective in the White Paper: to achieve an enhanced service level for pan-European credit transfers, including same-day settlement by 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Thus, from 1 January 2008 at the latest, euro area citizens should have Credeuro and Prieuro as optional standards for domestic/pan-European credit transfers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.56,0)">Direct debits At present, direct debits are not even available at a pan-European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.01,0)">For the pan-European direct debit  , the challenge facing the EPC is to make up for initial delays on the project, which ultimately is aiming for Europe-wide use by 2010, with an intermediate goal being optional use for national payments by 1 January 2008 at the latest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Sufficient time would have to be allocated to secure the gradual migration of larger direct debit communities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Therefore, the ECB urges the EPC to pursue the PEDD project without further delay, since this is a necessary part of a true SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">To assist the EPC and to contribute to the establishment of a pan-European direct debit scheme, the Eurosystem, in its role as a catalyst for retail payments, is currently: evaluating the pan-European direct debit scheme presented by the EPC in terms of compatibility with national legislation in the Member States , in particular in euro area countries; and identifying obstacles for the implementation of the proposed pan-European direct debit scheme and, if possible, suggesting measures which could be included in the policy debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Card transfers Even before the introduction of the euro, there was a well-developed service for using cards in cross-border transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.18,0)">However, there tends to be a dichotomy between national credit and debit card and international credit card solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.1,0)">A pan-European proposal is lacking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Thus, we are still far from having a SEPA where any cardholder can use his or her card in any ATM or point of sale  , at reasonable cost, with no differentiation within the euro area based on country of origin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Therefore, the Eurosystem wishes to see improvements so that cardholders can use their cards the same way nationally and within the SEPA from 1 January 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.91,0)">This includes issues such as costs, technical security, merchant acceptance rates for cards Europe-wide, as well as fraud levels that influence customers’ trust and confidence in cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This, in my view, is clearly an area where there is a considerable room for improving services for customers and merchants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The EMV implementation provides a perfect opportunity for action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Thus, to conclude this analysis of the three major payment instruments   from a customer perspective, the euro area is still not a domestic payment area because none of these three is truly pan-European.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">SEPA can never be built on cross-border instruments alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">SEPA requires giving customers the possibility to use highly efficient pan-European payment instruments that work similarly both within the “small town”   and beyond its borders  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">However, let us assume that the EPC, within reasonable time, will agree on standards and business practices for each payment instrument in order to make them SEPA-compliant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Can we then also assume that the EPC will be able to make sure that the use of these instruments and practices does not remain confined to cross-border business?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Can we assume that SEPA will work with the present infrastructure without accompanying adjustments on the supply side?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Let me take the implementation of the common account identifier   as an example of the EPC’s ability to make banks commit to agreed decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We have noticed that the EPC has made progress, but only after confronting great difficulties and then for cross-border transfers only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The real challenge remains: implementing IBAN for all national transfers in SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">A number of major euro area banks may lead by example and commit voluntarily to IBAN for national use by jointly signing a letter of intent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.31,0)">It may be valid to ask how to judge this in the context of the fact that the authorities in Latvia, Poland, Romania and Slovenia have enforced the IBAN as the national and cross-border payment standard by regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">Currently, the national account structures are, in effect, trade barriers protecting the different national banking systems from outside competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Of course, just as every country has a common account structure for its currency, the euro area also needs a common account structure for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The implementation of IBAN also for national payments will facilitate consolidation of infrastructures across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Thus, IBAN is a key driver for change and requires a move from national to pan-European logic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Pan-European credit transfers   and pan-European direct debits   are crucial payment instruments for SEPA, and both require IBAN.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Therefore, the main open question, which is not sufficiently explained in the EPC Charter, is how the pan-European instruments, now being defined, will gradually replace the national payment instruments and practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">3 The way forward I understand that the transition from national payment instruments to pan-European ones is currently facing several obstacles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">Hence, I would like to put forward some ideas to break this impasse: Firstly, a SEPA for citizens should be achieved from 2008 by offering citizens and commercial enterprises the chance to use pan-European instruments also for national business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Thus, a customer could use formats and standards based on the PEACH standards for national payments as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Customers could make all their euro payments, national and cross-border, in one format from one account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">This could bring considerable cost savings, especially for corporate customers with payment traffic to and from several euro area countries, and allow the corporate treasurer to send all payments in one file and with one format to any bank for execution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This would enable the concept of a single treasury workstation to which information about all incoming payments from the 12 euro area countries could be sent in one file and with one format, enabling automatic reconciliation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For the first time, end-to-end STP   would become a reality at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">An additional benefit for the corporate customer would be that payments could easily be redirected to any bank in the euro area without making any changes to the format.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">For private citizens, the most direct effect of SEPA would probably be the replacement of national cards with pan-European ones that could be readily used in almost any shop or ATM in the entire euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">During a transition period, national services, standards and instruments could co-exist alongside their pan-European counterparts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This scenario would mean a gradual dismantling of the present barriers, which are based on specific national standards and business practices, and currently protect national infrastructures from outside competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">As we already have one infrastructure   that is PEACH-compliant, and may expect a few more by 2008, banks can implement SEPA for euro area citizens without major problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Assuming that this scenario works, the ECB would be relaxed about full SEPA completion for the industry in 2010, provided citizens could benefit in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">As a kind of parallel, citizens have benefited from a SEPA for cash ever since 1 January 2002, even if there is still work to do on the supply side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">As soon as major customers start to use Credeuro and PEDD for all their payments, a substantial shift of volume is expected into PEACH infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.98,0)">However, should the Eurosystem see that banks are having difficulties in implementing pan-European payment instruments, the ECB might find itself having to regulate in order to make SEPA a reality for citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.62,0)">But this would still not be enough to achieve a fully effective SEPA, as banks would still have two parallel infrastructures to support  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Therefore, the SEPA endgame would be to abolish redundant national infrastructures or transform them into PEACHes, which should be easier to achieve once customers are given the choice to use pan-European instruments domestically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.62,0)">If the final deadline for the endgame were to be reconsidered after the national transition plans had been presented, this would only be possible provided that customers did not suffer from the delay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.62,0)">However, any postponement would also have to be compared with the costs to society of keeping a parallel, redundant infrastructure with continuously declining volumes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Secondly, a SEPA for the infrastructure should be completed by end-2010 by ensuring that: the EPC has committed to the endgame of migrating national standards, business practices and infrastructures to euro area ones by end-2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">This would remove any doubt about the need for investment in the transition to pan-European payment instruments and to a pan-European infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The EPC and national banking communities will have to work out how this will be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">national SEPA migration strategies are developed to support the transformation of national infrastructures into PEACH solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">An agreement at EPC level on such scenarios should be accompanied by a clear communication of the final objective, such as reducing costs to at least the level of the most efficient national systems today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">As a logical consequence of the migration, the decisions on the next generation of national systems should be taken from a pan-European perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">They should become PEACH-compliant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">When an investment cycle comes to an end in a national infrastructure, two options should be considered: either to abolish it or transform it into a PEACH.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Here the system owners will have to choose between different solutions to fit their specific   migration plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">4 Conclusions In conclusion, I would like to stress again that the ECB prefers a market-first approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">I realise that, to achieve SEPA, it’s best for the EPC to be in the driver’s seat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">You, as bankers, know best what standards and business practices would lead to efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">However, even if the market does know best, it cannot be taken for granted that, for example, pan-European standards will be implemented by all euro area banks, especially if individual banks prevent the euro area from benefiting from necessary investments purely out of self-interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Therefore, the ECB will also continue to watch closely where self-regulation will work, and where it has its limitations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">I can assure you that we take our responsibility of promoting the efficiency of payment systems seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">For citizens and corporations, this means ensuring access to efficient pan-European payment instruments for all their payment needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">It also means taking advantage of the full potential of economies of scale and scope through a competitive pan-European infrastructure to achieve SEPA for the infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Full SEPA completion could be achieved in two steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The ECB expects SEPA for citizens in 2008 and SEPA for industry in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">This would be an important element in the integration of financial markets and contribute to ensuring the success of the Lisbon agenda by 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Therefore, the ECB would like the EPC to confirm its commitment to the SEPA White Paper in a letter of intent specifying what will be achieved by 2008 and 2010, and to state how it intends to arrive at these targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">The ECB would attach particular importance to such a letter of intent if it were to be co-signed by the CEOs of all the euro area banks that wish to support the EPC actively as a sign of their commitment to SEPA.</span>
