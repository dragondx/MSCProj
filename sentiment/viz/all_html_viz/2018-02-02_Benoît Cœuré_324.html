    <span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)"> The euro area’s three lines of defence Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the conference “Deepening of EMU”, Ljubljana, 2 February 2018 For a long time, the European Central Bank has been at the forefront of macroeconomic stabilisation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.8,0)">There’s broad agreement that without our unprecedented actions, the euro area would have fared far worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.88,0)">Even more people would have lost their jobs, and wages and prices would have stagnated for much longer, or would even have fallen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Although our actions were bold and unparalleled, we acted within our mandate, as confirmed by the European Court of Justice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.76,0)">The establishment of the European Stability Mechanism, and the progress made in setting up a banking union, have fixed some of the shortcomings in euro area governance and instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">These steps were important in easing the pressure the crisis has put on the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.79,0)">But many of the institutional failings that caused and perpetuated the crisis remain unresolved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.09,0)">Incentives to pursue sound policies remain too weak and stabilisation of shocks too difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.7,0)">These are deep-rooted issues that cannot be resolved by a few years of above-trend growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.67,0)">To assume that the current economic expansion will heal all wounds is naive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The euro area needs reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.7,0)">As the central bank of the euro area, the ECB should not interfere in the details of what is mostly a political debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">But we have a stake in the success of the current discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.0,0)">Without further reforms, the next crisis may well force the ECB to test the limits of its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.2,0)">Depending on the nature of the next crisis, policy action might require taking short-term rates much deeper into negative territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.35,0)">Or it might require purchases of assets that are riskier than public or corporate debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.09,0)">Or it may draw us dangerously close to monetary financing of governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.61,0)">As things stand today, and given member states’ still limited fiscal policy space, even a small downturn could create large economic and social costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It could, once again, test the cohesiveness of the currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.45,0)">Unless the euro area finds a way to change direction, to reform itself and to regain space for active macroeconomic policy, the same fractures we saw in 2012 could reappear and widen when the next downturn comes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Many ideas for reforms are being floated, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Some are bolder than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The recent proposals by German and French economists are a worthwhile attempt to bridge differences and surmount trade-offs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.61,0)">Today I will not offer another blueprint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">What I will offer instead are requirements than any euro area reform will have to pass.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I will call them the three “lines of defence” that any well-functioning monetary union depends on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">They are needed to deliver a stable currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">They are needed to protect the ECB and its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">And they are needed to keep belief in the future of the euro strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Flexible markets form the first line of defence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">They are indispensable for a currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">They reduce the need for macroeconomic stabilisation and curb contentious debates about crisis management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Markets that can absorb shocks efficiently do not waste costly political capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">And they create more policy space in downturns, for both fiscal and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">To bolster the first line, the way we implement economic policies needs to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.47,0)">The current system has clearly not delivered its intended benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Take the European Commission’s country-specific recommendations as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.78,0)">In 2016, less than 5% of the recommendations were implemented by Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.11,0)">Limited enforcement of the recommendations, rather than the incorrect identification of the main issues, has made the existing framework fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.63,0)">Why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.85,0)">Because recommendations from outside a country, even if correct on substance, are typically dismissed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.33,0)">Sovereign governments don’t accept what they see as diktats from Brussels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.89,0)">Economists should have known better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Incentives are the drivers of our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">So, if outside recommendations are perceived as being politically too costly, then we need to find solutions that promote national “ownership” of reform efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.29,0)">Money is not the answer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.26,0)">It is political incentives that need resolve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The other key domain to spur the catalyst function of our market economies is the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.63,0)">It is incomplete as we all know.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Take services as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">They account for over 70% of the EU’s GDP and an equal share of its employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">But we still face significant barriers when it comes to cross-border service provision in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The Services Package that was adopted about a year ago was a step in the right direction but more needs to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Efficient and integrated financial markets are part of the first line of defence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In the United States, around 60% of a shock to a state’s GDP is cushioned by financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In the euro area, the share is currently closer to 20%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.06,0)">Country-specific shocks remain unsmoothed to a large extent, mainly because cross-border equity risk-sharing is hugely underdeveloped in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">A true capital markets union could significantly help to diversify and reduce risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">It would thereby limit the financial burden to be levied by governments in the case of adverse shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">And it would broaden the scope of monetary policy transmission beyond the banking sector, making policy less vulnerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.16,0)">Finally, to avert banking collapses, governments in the past were forced to disburse large sums of public money in the pursuit of economic and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Completing banking union will reduce risks for taxpayers and break the remaining link between banks and national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">A European deposit insurance scheme is a precondition for a truly integrated banking system and single money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let us not forget that 86% of our money is created by commercial banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.25,0)">The transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy will always be incomplete as long as differences in depositor confidence prevail across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The second line of defence relates to the role of governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.15,0)">Even the most flexible and efficient markets cannot fully absorb very large shocks without imposing economic hardship on a considerable number of people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In other words, flexible markets come at a price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.1,0)">They increase uncertainty for employees and often require relinquishment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.67,0)">Uncertainty, for example, is born of the fear of a loss of employment or of not being able to respond to today’s fast pace of change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.8,0)">But it is also born of the fear that governments themselves have been pushed to the sidelines as globalisation has proceeded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.57,0)">Recent election outcomes around the world bear witness to this fear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.8,0)">The more exposed individuals are, the more likely a political backlash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Governments can mitigate these effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.96,0)">Unlike the United States, however, the European Union is not a federation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This means that, as a rule, stabilisation and the provision of security in the form of social services takes place first at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Keeping governments solvent is a precondition for achieving that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.55,0)">As we saw during the crisis, if perceptions of sustainability among markets decline, then counter-cyclical spending can quickly become constrained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">So we need to regain fiscal space, which means building adequate national fiscal buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The current broad-based economic expansion is contributing a lot to this end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.09,0)">But many countries are emerging from the crisis still bearing legacy burdens that could take decades to resolve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.01,0)">This leaves us vulnerable to divergence and fragmentation when a crisis strikes – and in some ways, even more so than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Fiscal consolidation therefore needs to go hand in hand with efforts strengthening our area-wide defences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Of course, the ESM is already an important safeguard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">But we need to enhance its competences in the field of crisis management and make it more agile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">This includes making full use of its existing instruments, such as the direct bank recapitalisation tool and precautionary financial assistance, and moving away from the unanimity requirement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">And in the long run, it means bringing the ESM into the community framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.22,0)">The stability of the euro area cannot be in the hands of one, or a few, Member States and their parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Ultimately, the ESM needs to be accountable to the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.19,0)">But union stabilisation cannot stop with the ESM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">The euro area needs a fiscal instrument that can help it cope with large shocks without having to rely excessively on the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Such an instrument would be the third line of defence of our monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">It would support aggregate demand in countries experiencing a crisis, drawing on common funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">It would thereby provide an additional layer of stabilisation that safeguards trust in national policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">EU solidarity would then take on a whole new meaning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Whether such an instrument would directly support national safety nets, or would instead undertake investment projects that create jobs and income, will be subject to much debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Whether it should be balanced by stronger market discipline will be even more heatedly debated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">These discussions will take time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">However important, they should not obscure what should be governments’ urgent priority: strengthening the first two lines of defence of our monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Achieving lasting economic stability must involve finding a balance of discipline and flexibility in our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This will both strengthen support for the euro and help alleviate the pressure and burden on the ECB in crisis times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.3,0)">Realpolitik will dictate the speed of reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">What we do need is broad agreement that they will be built on these three lines of defence, and visible progress on the first two.</span>
