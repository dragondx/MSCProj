    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)"> What lessons can be learned from the economic and financial crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat the “5e Rencontres de l’Entreprise Européenne” organised by La Tribune, Roland Berger and HECParis, 17 March 2009 Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs, the “Rencontres de l’Entreprise Européenne” were established – if I may interpret your mission – as a tribute to entrepreneurship, the engine of growth in Europe and, more broadly, in the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Looking around this room, I see myself surrounded by many entrepreneurial people who create the conditions for sustainable growth, who invest in both physical capital and human capital, and who are patient enough to wait for deferred payoffs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">As a central banker, I very much appreciate the medium-term orientation of business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.14,0)">The current crisis has exposed a different and less far-sighted kind of investment attitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I want to draw some parallels, and make some distinctions, between the two forms of economic activity and the lessons to be learned from them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Tonight, I would like to examine the roots of the current crisis and the policy responses, which are taken to address it and to inspire a new sense of direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">I will also explain what I see as the main factors that can provide the basis for a resurgence of growth in the not so distant future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">A future that will see companies and their employees in the real economy return to the forefront of economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.2,0)">Throughout, I will take inspiration from the words of Jean Monnet: “To abandon a project because it meets too many obstacles is often a grave mistake: the obstacles themselves provide the friction to make movement possible.”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Financial excesses In the last ten years, we saw a dramatic shift in influence away from entrepreneurship in the real economy to speculation and gambling in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.5,0)">The assumption and the hedging of genuine economic risk gradually ceased to be the main concern of international finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.77,0)">This is the risk that companies face when introducing innovative new products and new processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.53,0)">Over time, the creation and assumption of financial risk became the core activity of the financial industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.53,0)">This is the risk inherent in arbitrage and deliberate exposure to asset price changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.53,0)">At some point, the financial system seemed to be no longer there primarily to hedge existing economic risks, but more and more to create and propagate risks on its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">In the past two decades, financial innovation and liberalisation made important contributions to the overall productivity of our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">But as the demand for finance increased throughout the 1990s, intermediaries had growing incentives to develop innovative funding techniques.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The securitisation of assets, for example – the transformation of bilateral loans into tradable credit instruments – had tremendous potential to facilitate the diversification and efficient management of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">As such, it was a powerful and useful tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.51,0)">But securitisation also meant that banks and non-banks were able to sell credit – or place it off-balance sheet – immediately after it had been extended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This alchemy enabled lenders to expand the volume of their operations and conserve on capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.63,0)">Fatally, the same mechanism weakened lenders’ incentives for prudent screening and steady monitoring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.3,0)">The resulting declines in underwriting standards and lending oversight was one of the main sources of the excessive credit boom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.52,0)">The credit boom had three multipliers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.56,0)">First, ill-designed compensation schemes for loan managers reinforced the shortening of lenders’ horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.99,0)">In the eyes of many loan managers, the short-run gains from an expansion of credit obscured the need for any consideration of the potential losses that their institution could incur over the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.89,0)">Second, the complex structure of securitised products made it difficult for the ultimate holders to assess the quality of the underlying investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This perpetuated the boom, as it took time for investors to discover and reassess the underlying risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Third, international imbalances and their potential to encourage liquidity creation on a global scale acted as the macroeconomic – and perhaps most powerful – multiplier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.11,0)">A chronic shortage of savings in some of the world’s advanced economies was funded by an excess of savings in other parts of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.56,0)">These global macroeconomic imbalances contributed to the creation of international liquidity and therefore further fuelled credit and debt accumulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.26,0)">In the period before the start of the crisis, the oil and commodity price shock augmented the savings glut even further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.63,0)">The policy response The interplay of the forces that I have described went into reverse – suddenly, although not unexpectedly – sometime in the middle of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.49,0)">Liquidity dried up, and the entire financial sector was put under severe strain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.56,0)">The collapse of a major and highly interconnected financial player in mid-September of last year then turned the crisis of confidence into full-blown distress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">This development also triggered the economic downturn that we are currently facing, and that has created a need to restore confidence throughout the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.22,0)">The European Central Bank moved pre-emptively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">It ensured the continued functioning of the money market at the very first signs of the turbulences in August 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.32,0)">We have not shied away from action at any time since then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Our actions have been early, resolute and broadly based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.54,0)">What did the ECB do and why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And how did these actions support the financial sector and the real economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In times of distress, banks and other financial intermediaries instinctively reduce their exposure to risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Individually, they try to change the composition of their assets; they reduce illiquid investments and increase liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.85,0)">Collectively, this process leads to what is known as “deleveraging”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.14,0)">Banks’ intermediation is reduced in the aggregate, and loans to companies are curtailed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.7,0)">If this process unfolds in a disorderly manner, it can cause severe damage for borrowers and for the broader economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.19,0)">At the first signs of liquidity hoarding by banks in August 2007, the ECB took several measures to protect against a disorderly correction in credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.57,0)">Banks were not only concerned about the volume of liquidity that they could secure, but also about the horizon over which liquidity was expected to remain available to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Therefore, we provided liquidity with long maturities, as a way to insure banks against future liquidity shortfalls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This helped bolster public confidence that banks would continue to be able to meet their obligations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">At the same time, it encouraged banks – which, as you know, are so central to Europe’s financial architecture – not to discontinue lending relationships with their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Since the intensification of the crisis in September and October 2008, the ECB has – under profoundly changed global conditions, falling commodity prices and rapidly receding inflationary pressures – stepped up its crisis resolution measures, including through non-standard means, to protect the viability of our financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Again, our primary concern in the area of support to the financial sector has been to preserve the availability of credit for companies and households at accessible rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">One can therefore describe our policies as enhanced credit support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Under our generalised “fixed-rate full-allotment” procedure, in place since October, eligible euro area banks have been granted access to unlimited liquidity from one week to six months’ duration at our main policy interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Another non-standard measure has been the considerable expansion of the list of eligible assets that banks can pledge as collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">This has eased banks’ balance sheet constraints, and encouraged them to extend new credit or continue rolling over maturing loans to firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">As the inflationary pressures that we were still observing until last summer, receded rapidly, we have also been able to grant unlimited access to central bank credit at a sharply decreasing cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.17,0)">Our key policy rate has been reduced by 275 basis points since the crisis worsened in the autumn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">At present, the Eurosystem is providing unlimited refinancing at a rate of 1.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And sound and creditworthy banks can secure overnight credit at an interest rate which is in between the main policy rate, namely 1.5%, and the deposit rate, namely 0.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">At present the overnight rate is at a level unseen in the entire post-war history of European monetary affairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Being able to borrow at such low costs, banks can grant credit to other banks and to their non-bank customers at conditions that are very accommodative by historical and international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.9,0)">Thanks, in particular, to smaller spreads between the interbank money market rates and the OIS rates, the 6-month and 12-month EURIBOR rates are lower than the corresponding LIBOR rates for contracts denominated in US dollars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Enhanced credit support has also meant a considerable expansion of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The size of our balance sheet is currently around €600 billion above its pre-crisis volume.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This measures the size of the additional intermediation we are undertaking – substituting for the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The size of our balance sheet represents today around 16% of euro area GDP compared with 10% before the crisis; the Federal Reserve System’s balance sheet is around 13% of US GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The additional intermediation has prevented a seizing up of the whole credit market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.04,0)">Short-term interest rates on loans to households and businesses have declined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The pass-through of the ECB interest rates to the economy has proceeded in accordance with past regularities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">How does this policy course of enhanced credit support compare with the approaches of some other central banks grappling with tumult in financial markets?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Since mid-September 2008 the Federal Reserve has pursued a policy of direct “credit easing”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.6,0)">These measures are targeted at directly addressing instability or declining credit availability in critical non-bank channels of intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.11,0)">The euro area and the United States have significantly different financial structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">While the United States has a primarily market-based financial system, the euro area is largely bank-centred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.68,0)">A few illustrative figures give an idea of the differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">At the end of 2007, the stock of outstanding bank loans to the private sector amounted to around 145% of GDP in the euro area, but only 63% in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.61,0)">Correspondingly, the incidence of direct debt securities was 81% of GDP in the euro area and 168 % in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.42,0)">The structures of private credit outstanding in the euro area and the United States are almost mirror images: the recourse to banks on this side of the Atlantic makes up two-thirds of non-equity external finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.31,0)">On the other side, the equivalent proportion is only around 30%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This has important explanatory power for interpreting the approaches that we have taken in the euro area and in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">In the context of the euro area, guaranteeing firms and households a steady access to credit largely means ensuring the banking system has appropriate liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In the euro area, it is natural for “credit easing” to be implemented primarily through the participation of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.03,0)">As regards non-conventional measures, let me recall the following.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We have already decided upon a number of them, including the non-standard commitment decided at our last meeting to prolong the unlimited supply of liquidity at fixed rates as long as needed, and in any case beyond the end of 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Moreover, as I said in my press conference of 5 March, we are in an ongoing process of studying further measures and assessing the possible need for them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Reviewing our actions over the past few months, there is one further point that I wish to highlight: the central bank was not alone in tackling this financial and economic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">I have been deeply impressed by the action plan drawn up by euro area governments and the European Commission since last October within an extremely short period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.02,0)">In the past, some outside observers have questioned the euro area’s ability to act in a timely fashion in the event of a major economic emergency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Last October euro area governments and the European Commission demonstrated their strength and unity of purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Governments’ coordinated bank recapitalisation and guarantee schemes proved vital for preserving the viability of the euro area financial system in extremely tense conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The way forward Looking ahead to the resolution of this crisis, the following is a good starting point: we should start by distinguishing carefully between the many things that were wrong and need to change, and the many other things that were right and that we can continue to count on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.92,0)">A number of “monuments” and “totems” of the pre-crisis economic universe have now lost most of their value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">From this standpoint, the reforms proposed by the Financial Stability Forum and currently considered by the G20 should be implemented with vigour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">At the same time, other elements have maintained their worth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It is on these elements that we should build the future of this continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I will mention three assets on which we can count in this effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The first asset is our single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The euro has certainly proven its worth during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.52,0)">If the countries of Europe that now make up the euro area had been forced to withstand the financial turmoil alone, with their floating currencies, currency crises would have been likely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.52,0)">The crisis in the European Monetary System in 1992 and 1993 naturally comes to my mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">With the benefit of hindsight, we can see the introduction of the euro ten years ago as a forward-looking response to the challenges of today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And let us not forget that the process leading to the introduction of the euro owes a great deal to the prescience of President Valéry Giscard d’Estaing and Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, who in the late 1970s conceived the European Monetary System and the precursor to the euro, the ECU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">A second lasting resource for Europe is a macroeconomic policy framework oriented towards the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.38,0)">With hindsight observers now acknowledge that macroeconomic policies in some economies have in the past been insufficiently focused on medium-term stability and sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In the euro area policy commitments to price stability over the medium term and to the long-run sustainability of public finances helped, by and large, to contain the size of macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">This has contributed to job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.04,0)">In the past ten years, the euro area created more than 2 million jobs in excess of the number created over the same period in the US economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The third asset is a group of factors that have made our real economies in Europe successful in recent years: our openness to trade; our balanced and dynamic business structures; our talented and well-trained workforces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">None of these factors is single-faceted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.56,0)">It is well known that international comparisons of productivity growth started to paint a bleak picture of the euro area countries in the middle of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">While the measured pace of growth of output per hour worked halved after 1995 in our economies, it almost doubled in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">In trying to understand the causes of that poor performance we discovered that the share of the population in tertiary education was almost two-thirds higher in the United States than in the European Union and that US and Japanese performance was superior in terms of patents granted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">But we also discovered that the EU, and the euro area in particular, was home to at least two of the world’s innovation leaders – Germany and Finland – and that this country, France, together with Belgium is on a par with the United States in terms of the structural conditions required for innovation, investment in research and development, and the successful application of know-how.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Furthermore, we learned that the financial sector, a principal user of information and communications technologies, was the main source of the greater dynamism in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.72,0)">Conversely, a smaller share of that sector in total value added was seen as the main obstacle to the diffusion of such technologies, and thus a drag on overall productivity, in the euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Today, this much smaller share of financial services in the euro area economy can probably act as a partial protection against the recessionary forces that the downsizing of those activities is exerting on many of our international partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The openness of our economies, too, has been seen as a major challenge, not an opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Certainly, greater openness has meant that our economies have been more exposed to the international crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">But the trend towards global trade integration has resulted in a major adjustment of production patterns in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Many countries have profoundly adjusted their export portfolios according to their technological advantages and towards products that are more skill-intensive and more capital-intensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This upgrade of our production structure will make European firms better prepared to withstand a decline in trade volumes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.79,0)">From an economic perspective, resilience is a virtue, protectionism is a sin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.52,0)">Fiscal and monetary authorities constantly endeavour to shield their jurisdictions from shocks and disturbances that can destabilise economic behaviour and expectations, and thus damage aggregate incomes and collective welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But this must be done without building walls and fortresses around the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.37,0)">Open markets are the valuable result of a long and painful process of trade liberalisation that has lasted over 60 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">This process has dismantled barriers between countries and has included an expanding share of the world population in a network of exchange and growing economic prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.72,0)">And we know from past experience in the 20th Century that protectionism would be a recipe for economic disaster.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Conclusions More than ever, in the present very demanding circumstances, confidence is key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.22,0)">The global economy was hit in mid-September 2008 by an unprecedented abrupt loss of confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.32,0)">It was perhaps the first time in economic history that a single negative event was able, within a few days, to have a simultaneous and negative effect on all private economic agents in every economy, industrialised and emerging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.78,0)">This is why we are presently in uncharted waters, and the risk of abrupt economic and financial phenomena and unprecedented behaviour on the part of economic agents remains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Public authorities, executive branches, and central banks must do all they can to regain, preserve and foster confidence among households and corporations to pave the way for sustainable prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This calls for actions to be measured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">We must maintain the appropriate balance between the need to take immediate action commensurate with the gravity of today’s situation and the equally undeniable obligation to return to a path that is sustainable in the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Confidence of households and corporations today depends crucially on their trust in the capacity of authorities to preserve the soundness and sustainability of fiscal positions in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Confidence of economic agents today depends equally on their trust in the determination of central banks to preserve price stability – in Europe less than 2% but close to 2% - in the medium and long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">It is essential to achieve this balance between the measured audacity of today’s non-conventional decisions and the credible determination to ensure a path that is sustainable in the medium and long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.89,0)">Exaggerated swings without perspective would delay the return of sustainable prosperity, because they would undermine confidence, which is the most precious ingredient in the present circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Europe can count on the ECB to continue to strike the right balance between audacity and wisdom, in line with its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In acting in this way, the ECB will continue to offer a solid anchor of stability and confidence.</span>
