    <span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)"> Monetary policy in uncertain times Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat the Bank of Finland 200th Anniversary ConferenceHelsinki, 5 May 2011 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak at your conference on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">It is remarkable to think that the Bank of Finland will celebrate its two hundredth anniversary this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The ECB, as the youngest central bank in the world, but with such an extraordinarily solid historical legacy in the Eurosystem, looks at such a storied history in the European monetary team with pride.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This conference occurs at a point in time when central banks and governments of the advanced economies continue to face a wide range of challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">I would like to start by reflecting in front of you on a challenge that, at first sight, may seem not directly related to monetary policy: strengthening economic governance in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Strong economic governance – and therefore closer economic union – is however the fundamental counterpart to the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">With a centralised monetary policy but decentralised fiscal and economic policies – in the absence of a federal institutional framework - those policies have to be placed in a solid framework and appropriately coordinated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The duty of public institutions is to fulfil their mandate and, by doing so, to meet the expectations of the citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The ECB’s Governing Council has done so and fulfilled public expectations in line with its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Citizens in Europe expect overall stable prices and their purchasing power to be maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Over the first 12 years, the ECB has delivered an average annual rate of inflation of 1.97%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Citizens expect a stable economy and public authorities that are alert and effective in combating crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The ECB has taken unprecedented steps to mitigate the effects of the recent crisis on the real economy by ensuring the flow of credit to the households and firms and preserving financial stability – of which I will talk more later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In the field of economic governance, however, public institutions still need to make a ‘quantum leap’ to meet public expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">European citizens recognise the value of closer economic cooperation, particularly those in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Surveys indicate that, on average in euro area countries, more than four out of five euro area citizens are in favour of greater policy coordination between countries to overcome the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">This is something, which I consider very important: citizens want a stronger and better coordination of economic and financial policies in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The challenge facing policymakers today is how to deliver the deeper economic union that is so fundamental to EMU and to the expectations of its citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">All agree that the existing economic governance framework needs to be reformed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Fiscal and broader macroeconomic policies have to be consistent with rates of sustainable growth and price stability in a stability-orientated economic and monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">To achieve this, the Stability and Growth Pact needs to be reinforced and a strong surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances and competitiveness needs to be installed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Important negotiations are ongoing between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament to reach agreement on the legislative package to reform economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">For these reforms to reach the ‘quantum leap’ that is required, the following elements are essential: First, greater automaticity is needed in all surveillance procedures, including the new macroeconomic surveillance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.11,0)">The Council should have less room for halting or suspending procedures against Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.27,0)">Strict deadlines to avoid lengthy procedures and the deletion of escape clauses would further automaticity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">This is critical to ensure the credibility of the new framework and address spillovers in a timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Second, enforcement tools need to be more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">In addition to financial sanctions, political and reputational measures would help foster early compliance, as would the application of earlier and more gradual financial sanctions within the macroeconomic surveillance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.17,0)">Discretion to reduce or suspend financial sanctions is undesirable as it strongly reduces effectiveness and sets the wrong incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Third, more ambitious policy requirements would better match the current reality of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It makes sense for macroeconomic surveillance to have a clear focus on the euro area countries with large current account deficits, significant losses of competitiveness and high levels of public and private debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">As regards fiscal surveillance, ambitious benchmarks are needed when establishing an excessive deficit and in setting the adjustment path towards a country’s medium-term budgetary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Finally, the gap between the EU and national level must be closed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.35,0)">New procedures will not be sufficient if they are not solidly anchored at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Binding commitments by Member States to swiftly implement strong national budgetary frameworks are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In my view, the proposals agreed by the Council do not represent the significant leap towards closer economic union that is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">The European Parliament has been more ambitious in its approach, particularly as regards greater automaticity and the broader and more timely use of sanctions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">I hope that the ongoing negotiations over the legislative package will permit the texts to be significantly improved along these lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">I believe that the citizens of Europe count on the European Parliament to take a broader perspective and drive these changes forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">There are also some important areas in which care should be taken not to weaken the texts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.96,0)">In particular, softening the Stability and Growth Pact by introducing further exceptions or treating in a special way specific expenditure items, such as public investment, would create further room for unwarranted discretionary decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">It is also of crucial importance that the economic governance reform is fully implemented as soon as possible and without any transition period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Beyond fiscal and broader macroeconomic governance, it is important to remember that economic union comprises a third governance pillar which is equally important: the structural reforms embedded in the “Europe 2020” strategy and the Euro Plus Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Structural reforms are essential to elevate the growth potential of the euro area in the face of ongoing debt sustainability challenges and future age-related expenditures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A specific example where urgent progress is needed is the incomplete single market in services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">It makes full economic sense and it is urgent to complete the single market in the sector in which a very large majority of people in Europe work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">When EMU was first established, many people asked how monetary union could function effectively in a Europe of sovereign states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The answer is simple: it can function effectively with an appropriate economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It is fully recognised that this economic union must be one where countries that wisely follow a virtuous economic path are rewarded, and those that pursue unsustainable policies have to internalise the costs of their actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">At the same time, economic union implies interconnectedness, and it is in all countries’ interest not to exacerbate difficulties by creating uncertainty in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We look to an economic union where all countries face up to their individuals responsibilities, but also an economic union which remains guided by a common cause and destiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">* * * Turning now to monetary policy, the challenges central banks are facing in fulfilling their role of a stable anchor are large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">First, decisions have to be made in an environment marked by a very high degree of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.1,0)">Although operating in an uncertain environment is common business for central banks, I would argue that structural transformations of our economies, the ever-growing complexity of global finance and the overall process of globalisation are itself creating a multidimensional acceleration of change leading to increased uncertainty on the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In addition, in crisis times there is an elevated degree of Knightian uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.13,0)">The character of this uncertainty can not be calculated or modelled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Acting pre-emptively to avoid possible grave consequences of events for which a priori probabilities do not exist implies that crisis prevention is a crucial part of policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This leads to another challenge, which is the need to communicate clearly the actions taken in the realm of crisis prevention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.75,0)">The immediate decisions that appear necessary to avoid crisis might not be fully understood by external observers, including the general public for the simple reason that they do not see the counterfactual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.3,0)">When measures are wisely taken ex ante, precisely to avoid the unfolding of an acute crisis, then decision-makers’ face the problem of explaining their actions in the light of something that did not happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is yet one more reason for why the independence of central banks is absolutely key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It is essential to permit them to take the appropriate preventive decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">As the world around us is rapidly changing, swift action is often called for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">I have previously proposed a posture of “credible alertness”, suggesting that it was the best approach for a central bank to anchor inflation expectations firmly, while being ready to take action at any point in time without being the prisoner of previous commitments on policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The threat to act will be more effective the more credible the central bank has been over time in actually delivering price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">In addition, the knowledge that the central bank will normally make use of all available options – as circumstances dictate – to counteract situations that have the potential for undermining confidence and perturbing market conditions enhance control of private expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Our readiness to act prior to the crisis, during the crisis and as far as the existing use of standard interest rate measures is concerned also currently is clearly demonstrated throughout time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Allow me to elaborate a little bit on some of the actions taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">In the exceptional times of the past three years, the response to the crisis by central banks around the world has led to the adoption of non-standard measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">In the case of the ECB, the non-standard measures adopted during the crisis are precisely designed to help restore a more normal functioning of the transmission mechanism and contribute to recreating an environment where the “standard measures” can operate effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It should be clear what the non-standard measures of the ECB are not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">They can not be seen as liquidity measures to stimulate activity at a lower bound for interest rate, where they would act where standard interest rate policy fails.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Rather “non-standard” measures can co-exist with different levels of the policy rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The monetary policy stance is always chosen by the Governing Council to deliver price stability in a medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The non-standard measures have a clear purpose: ensuring that the standard measures themselves are transmitted as effectively as possible despite the otherwise abnormal functioning of some markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The types of non-conventional operation implemented by the ECB fully allow us to amend the monetary policy stance, in particular through a change in the interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.92,0)">In other words, decisions about interest rates can be separated from the non-conventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I refer to this duality as the “separation principle”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The non-standard measures have to be commensurate with what we are observing on the market, namely to help the transmission of our monetary policy to function better again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The standard measures are there to deliver price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">For example, the ECB has indicated clearly that interest rate increases could perfectly well take place independently of the timing of the phasing out of the non-standard measures - if those non-standard measures continue to be fully justified by the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The separation principle can be seen operating recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">On April 7 the Governing Council decided to increase the interest rate on the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem by 25 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">I was particularly pleased that this decision was taken unanimously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">That was of course a very important decision that the Governing Council was implementing as regards the “standard measures”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">At the same time “non-standard measures” were maintained for the second quarter of this year, particularly the policy of full allotment and a fixed rate for the supply of liquidity with a duration of three months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">*** Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">I am convinced that when central banks and governments take up the tasks that are before them then we will surmount the difficulties our economies are experiencing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.92,0)">But this is no time for complacency in any respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The ECB, for its part, will do all that is necessary to continue to be a solid and reliable anchor of stability and confidence in these challenging times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">And there is little doubt that the future will continue to present new and unexpected challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The citizens of Europe can rely on our strong determination to ensure a very solid anchoring of inflation expectations – something that is more important than ever in turbulent times.</span>
