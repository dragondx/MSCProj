    <h1> The monetary policy toolbox: evidence from the euro area </h1>
    <h2> Keynote speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 2020 US Monetary Policy Forum </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Philip R. Lane </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)"> Speech New York, 21 February 2020 The monetary policy toolbox: evidence from the euro area Keynote speech by Philip R. Lane, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 2020 US Monetary Policy Forum Introduction I would like to thank Chicago Booth for inviting me to speak at the 2020 U.S. Monetary Policy Forum, sponsored by the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, New York, New York.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The focus of this year’s US Monetary Policy Forum, the analysis of unconventional monetary policies, is relevant for many economies, including the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That said, while central banks face many common challenges, the evolution of economic, financial and monetary conditions in the euro area was also specifically influenced by both the euro area sovereign debt crisis that followed the global financial crisis and the European policy responses to these crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.93,0)">As a result, the euro area is at a different point in the monetary policy cycle than other jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The post-crisis monetary policy of the ECB shares many similarities with that of the Federal Reserve: having largely exhausted the conventional space for moving its policy instrument  , the ECB turned to a broad set of unconventional measures in pursuit of its statutory objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, there are important differences between the unconventional measures taken by the Federal Reserve and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.2,0)">In particular, the ECB moved into negative territory with its policy rate, employed targeted refinancing operations to promote credit growth and customised its asset purchase programme   to the specific context of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Our understanding of the propagation mechanisms of these measures and their efficacy in supporting the economy and the inflation process is steadily deepening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In my remarks today, I will discuss our experience with the non-standard measures in our monetary toolbox and explain our monetary policy reaction function in the current below-target inflation environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The nature of our reaction function is spelled out in our forward guidance, which provides a unified framework across our different policy instruments – with the guidance on the rate path at its centre – and facilitates automatic adjustment in market conditions in response to shocks that are assessed as influencing the future path of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.51,0)">The case for unconventional measures in a low interest rate environment Interest rates in advanced economies have been on a broad downward path for more than three decades and remain close to historical lows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As has been highlighted in many studies, the drivers of this long-term pattern largely boil down to demographics, productivity and the elevated net demand for safe assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.54,0)">As a result, the real neutral interest rate   has declined across advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.24,0)">For the euro area, recent Eurosystem estimates point to r* at zero or even below zero, which is a marked decline since the early 2000s  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Estimates of r* for the United States show a similar trend but remain at a higher level than in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.84,0)">While the factors that have reduced r* are beyond the control of the central bank, the fact that the level of r* is lower has significant implications for monetary policy: the short-term policy interest rate hits the zero bound more often and, when it does so, remains at the lower bound for a longer time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.45,0)">A recent ECB staff paper shows that, in a scenario where r* falls from 2 percent to zero, the incidence of hitting the zero bound almost doubles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.69,0)">Lower real rates reduce the available policy space to counter low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.61,0)">This may increase the time it takes for inflation to return to target and this delay may be compounded if a prolonged period of low inflation also erodes inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">and Penalver, A.    , “The natural rate of interest: estimates, drivers, and challenges to monetary policy”, Occasional Paper Series, No 217, ECB; and all works cited in footnote   The dark shaded area highlights smoother r* estimates that are statistically less affected by cyclical movements in the real rate of interest than the other estimates depicted here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy toolbox The Governing Council’s monetary policy reaction function is laid out in our forward guidance on the path of our policy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Together with the forward guidance on the rate path at the centre, this provides a coherent framework for the various non-standard measures which the ECB has deployed: negative interest rates, asset purchases and targeted long-term refinancing operations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Forward guidance Initially expressed in qualitative terms, the ECB’s rate guidance has evolved over time, with the current formulation made explicitly conditional on a set of criteria regarding the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The cross-country experience with forward guidance indicates that its effectiveness can differ considerably depending on the type of conditionality attached to the policy rate path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.6,0)">In particular, time-based guidance provided over relatively short horizons appears to be rather ineffective in reducing market uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Conversely, the evidence indicates that rate forward guidance over long horizons, or state-based guidance, is more effective in reducing the sensitivity of asset prices to macroeconomic news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The state-contingent formulation links the Governing Council’s expected interest rate path to at least two conditions regarding the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">First, inflation has to “robustly converge to a level sufficiently close to, but below, 2 percent within our projection horizon.” Second, this convergence needs to be “consistently reflected in underlying inflation dynamics”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The first condition is forward-looking: inflation has to be seen to be converging to a level sufficiently close to 2 percent well before the end point of the horizon: this is the meaning of “robust convergence”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.3,0)">The second condition is backward-looking: we have to see the robust convergence in future inflation confirmed and verified in actual measures of underlying inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Importantly, the decision we took last September has established a unified framework for our forward guidance across policy instruments that links the horizon of both our net asset purchases and reinvestments to our forward guidance on the rate path: net purchases are expected to continue until “shortly” before we start raising the key ECB rates; and reinvestments are expected to run “for an extended period of time past the date when we start raising the key ECB interest rates”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.51,0)">Whereas the forward guidance on the rate path acts on the expectations component of longer-term rates, the asset purchases especially affect term premia, as I will discuss in more detail later on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Evidence suggests that the enhanced forward guidance we introduced last September is well understood by market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.79,0)">The interest rate lift-off dates in survey-based measures largely coincide with the time at which inflation expectations two years ahead – the horizon of the ECB/Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections – are around levels close to, but below, 2 percent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">This indicates that the link between our interest rate forward guidance and the inflation threshold is understood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">More than that, thanks to its state-contingent nature, our rate guidance provides an automatic stabilisation mechanism that steers rate expectations – and expectations about our asset purchases – as a function of the evolving inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In practice, we have seen this automatic stabilisation function of our forward guidance operate effectively, with market expectations for a first increase of the policy rate accommodating short-term volatility in the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.64,0)">For example, the January 2020 Bloomberg survey pointed to a later lift-off date of the second quarter of 2022   in comparison with the Bloomberg survey of April 2019  , which coincided with the slight decline in Consensus Economics expectations for annual inflation in the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.49,0)">The latest observation is for January 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In addition to serving as an automatic stabiliser for policy rate expectations, the interest rate forward guidance is also the anchor for expectations of the net asset purchase and reinvestment horizons, as these measures are tightly linked to the interest rate lift-off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.05,0)">Changes in the inflation outlook that trigger a reappraisal of the lift-off date should therefore also affect the expected end date of net asset purchases and reinvestments, thereby stabilising the long end of the yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In fact, this tight link is reflected in the positive co-movement between short and long-term interest rates in response to news that affects the macroeconomic outlook  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">While the automatic stabilisation function embedded in the forward guidance accommodates any short-term volatility in the outlook, the Governing Council continues to stand ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner, in line with its commitment to symmetry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Overall, the available evidence suggests that the ECB’s rate forward guidance has been and continues to be an effective monetary policy tool and that the transmission of forward guidance to financial conditions and the economy has remained stable over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">In part, this reflects the strong explicit conditionality embedded in the ECB’s evolving rate forward guidance statement as well as the interaction with asset purchases and other instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Negative interest rates Within our forward guidance framework, the negative interest rate policy has played a key role in enhancing this automatic stabilisation by lowering the effective lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.02,0)">There was no playbook to guide the 2014 decision to push the deposit facility rate – which the ECB pays on bank excess reserves – into negative territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Subsequent cuts, including the latest in September 2019, have brought the deposit facility rate to -0.5 percent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">A corollary of relaxing the lower bound constraint has been that the propagation of negative interest rates through the term structure of interest rates is qualitatively different and more powerful than traditional interest rate cuts occurring in positive territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The difference comes from two effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.54,0)">The primary mechanism is the way in which expectations about the future path of monetary policy are reflected in market interest rates when the central bank reduces the overnight interest rate to very low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.38,0)">If the central bank reduces its policy rate to zero and makes it clear that it will not lower its policy rate any further, then this declared and self-imposed non-negativity restriction influences rate expectations among market participants: looking to the future, they will see rate increases as being more likely than rate decreases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.08,0)">As a result, the predictive density of the future rate path will tend to be skewed upward, and interest rates at longer maturities will tend to decline by less than the reduction of the policy rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.2,0)">By contrast, under a negative interest rate policy, where future rate cuts are possible, the distribution of rate expectations is more symmetric, putting downward pressure on longer-maturity interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.43,0)">Rate expectations can even be skewed downwards if the negative rate policy is flanked by communication that the interest rate might be reduced further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.62,0)">In this vein, the ECB’s forward guidance has reinforced the negative interest rate policy by stating that the Governing Council expects the ECB’s key interest rates “to remain at their present or lower levels for an extended period of time”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.54,0)">cit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.88,0)">The mean and the percentiles are shifted to the EONIA space by subtracting the EURIBOR3M-OIS3M spot spread.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The forward curve distribution in January 2013 was rather steep and truncated in positive territory, which reflected the view of market participants that rates could not fall below zero and only increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This mechanism is illustrated in   Evidence shows that the improving financing conditions stemming from negative interest rates are feeding their way into the real economy through increased bank loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">There is also evidence that negative rates have increased corporate investment: firms with large holdings of liquid assets that are exposed to negative deposit rates have increased investment compared with firms with small holdings of liquid assets that are less affected by negative deposit rates  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This effect is economically significant and estimated to boost corporate investment by as much as 1 percentage point per annum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.89,0)">,   The latest observation is for 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.97,0)">That the effects of an interest rate cut are more powerful in negative territory can also be seen when considering the “footprint” on the term structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Using high-frequency financial market data   to identify monetary surprises, ECB analysis shows that the transmission is more powerful than that of a standard interest rate cut in positive territory, since its effect on the yield curve extends to longer maturities, with a maximum effect around medium-term maturities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">, Gürkaynak, R. S., Motto, R. and Ragusa, R.  , “Measuring euro area monetary policy”, Journal of Monetary Economics,   162-179.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.07,0)">Moreover, as banks tend to consider risk-free interest rates with short to medium-term maturities as the reference rates for pricing loans to non-financial corporations, the pronounced effects of the negative interest rate policy also propagate through the bank lending channel: our negative rate policy has contributed to a significant decline in lending rates to non-financial corporations since 2014, which in turn has translated into higher loan volumes channelled to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The bank-based nature of the euro area economy lends itself to a swift transmission of interest rates to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.81,0)">At the same time, there is a clear friction in the pass-through of negative rates to depositors, especially to retail customers  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.32,0)">Taken in isolation, this friction weighs on bank net interest income and profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.09,0)">The latest observation is for December 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.56,0)">That said, the overall impact of the negative interest rate policy extends beyond the mechanical effects on interest rate margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.99,0)">Negative rates – especially in combination with the other elements in our policy package – support the overall level of economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This leads to higher lending volumes and lower impairment provisioning, while interest rate cuts also generate capital gains on existing securities holdings and improve wholesale funding conditions for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">From 2014 to 2018, the aggregate impact of non-standard measures was positive for the profitability of the banking system  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.27,0)">The latest observation is for 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.34,0)">Nonetheless, the Governing Council is closely monitoring the risk that the impact of negative rates on bank profitability may impair the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Moreover, the ECB decided last September to introduce a two-tier system for remunerating excess liquidity holdings, with the aim of supporting the bank-based transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The interest rate on such holdings is now tiered, with excess liquidity holdings up to six times the minimum reserve requirements receiving zero interest and holdings beyond that level remunerated at the deposit facility rate of -0.5 percent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The implementation of the tiering policy has been smooth: on the one side, it has reduced the direct cost of negative interest rates for banks and thereby helped sustain the pass-through of low policy rates to bank lending rates, while on the other side, money market rates have continued to be well aligned with the policy rate, thereby preserving the positive contribution of negative rates to the accommodative stance of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.58,0)">Finally, we are alert to the possibility that there may be a level for the policy rate below which a policy easing would have perverse effects and in fact lead to a tightening of bank credit conditions: the reversal rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The ongoing pass-through of easing measures to lower lending rates and continued credit growth indicates that the reversal rate is not currently binding for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.24,0)">While measured credit growth is decelerating, this reflects the demand for bank loans mirroring the slowdown in the economy, and there are no signs of supply-side restrictions due to banks seeking to retrench from lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.47,0)">In fact, bank credit standards in the euro area have been either loosening or steady around very supportive levels since 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">In line with this, since the introduction of negative rates, banks have consistently reported in the ECB’s bank lending survey that they view negative rates as supportive of credit creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Targeted longer-term refinancing operations TLTROs are an effective tool for providing credit easing and are particularly useful if there is a risk of the bank-based transmission mechanism becoming impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Banks can use TLTROs to refinance with the ECB over an extended horizon and at very favourable conditions, provided that they meet the lending targets set by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.55,0)">Under the second and third rounds of the programme  , borrowing rates in the TLTROs can be as low as the deposit facility rate – which is currently set at -0.5 percent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">TLTROs lower bank funding costs via two distinct channels – direct and indirect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The funding cost relief is direct for those banks that use TLTRO financing instead of more expensive market funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">In addition, the TLTROs have indirectly contributed to favourable funding conditions on capital markets through the scarcity effects generated by reduced bond issuance from banks that replace market-based funding with TLTRO borrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The effectiveness of TLTROs can be analysed by comparing the change in lending rates between those banks that participated in the operations and those that did not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The comparison shows that participating banks granted significantly more favourable rates to their corporate clients than their non-participating counterparts, which suggests a sizeable easing of financing conditions for firms, especially in vulnerable countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.93,0)">“Vulnerable countries” are Ireland, Greece, Spain, Italy, Cyprus, Portugal and Slovenia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">“Other countries” are all the remaining euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Asset purchase programme Finally, by linking the horizon of the APP – both in terms of net purchases and the reinvestment policy – to the forward guidance on policy rates, expectations on the purchase horizon of the APP adjust in line with the inflation outlook and automatically regulate term premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The transmission of our asset purchases in the euro area has been similar to the transmission of other central banks’ asset purchases in their respective jurisdictions, with the most pronounced effects at longer maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">While negative interest rates and forward guidance have primarily been transmitted through the expectations component of interest rates, asset purchases have primarily operated through the term premium component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">This is due to asset purchases affecting interest rates mainly by reducing the interest rate   risk borne by investors holding long-term bonds – the duration risk extraction channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">By purchasing securities with a relatively long maturity, the central bank frees up risk-bearing capacity among investors and fosters a rebalancing of their portfolio towards other, more risky, types of assets, including investment in productive capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.11,0)">In the euro area, our net asset purchases and reinvestment policy have led to substantial duration risk being withdrawn from the market, in the order of 20 percent of the duration-equivalent stock of current public debt in the four largest euro area economies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Based on a term structure model that incorporates the duration channel, we can track the time-varying effect of the APP on term premia as expectations on the purchase horizon change over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.93,0)">At present, the APP is estimated to be compressing euro area ten-year sovereign yields by more than 100 basis points  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">We are confident that the effects of our asset purchases continue to feed through to euro area financial conditions and support a more accommodative monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.52,0)">The experience we have built up over the last five years does not indicate that asset purchases entail diminishing returns over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This is corroborated by recent research applied to the US experience which suggests that, once anticipation effects are taken into account, the later rounds of large-scale asset purchases undertaken by the Federal Reserve remained powerful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">More specifically, the estimated average annual contribution of the unconventional measures to euro area inflation is between 0.3 and 0.5 percentage points  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.72,0)">The estimated level of real GDP at the end of 2019 without the package of unconventional measures is between 2.5 and 3.0 percentage points lower than the observed level, and employment is estimated to be about 2.5 million lower in the absence of the measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">,   While the current mildly expansionary fiscal stance is providing some support, the more fiscal policy contributes to boosting long-term growth potential and providing cyclical stabilisation, the quicker will be the effects of monetary policy interventions on inflation and the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">In this regard, it is worth keeping in mind that the macroeconomic impact of fiscal policy is particularly strong in an environment in which inflationary pressures are muted and the expected interest rate path is not very steep.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.1,0)">These factors have constrained conventional monetary policy space and required a profound expansion of the policy toolbox in order to ensure the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Our forward guidance on interest rates, which makes the evolution of our policy rates contingent on the robust convergence of inflation to our aim, captures our monetary reaction function in the current environment of low inflation and low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Our forward guidance links the various unconventional monetary policy instruments together within a coherent framework and is proving effective in guiding adjustment in the expected path for policy rates and longer-term bond yields in response to the changing outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">As I have demonstrated, the ECB has been willing and able to calibrate the combination of its unconventional policy instruments in directions and on a scale that gives sizeable support to the economy and continues to support the convergence of inflation to our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">At the same time, if fiscal policy were to play a more supportive role alongside monetary policy, it would lead to a faster return of inflation to our objective and contribute to raising the equilibrium real interest rate, thereby alleviating the constraints on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Finally, the long-term trends that are being discussed at this conference give all central bankers pause for thought in terms of their strategy and instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In this vein, we announced last month the launch of a comprehensive review of our monetary policy strategy, which we expect to be concluded by the end of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">I am grateful to John Hutchinson and Arthur Saint-Guilhem for their contributions to this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">For example, Ben Bernanke calculates that the combination of asset purchases and forward guidance can add about 3 percentage points of policy space for the United States, assuming a neutral nominal rate in the range of 2 to 3 percent, see Bernanke, B.  , “The New Tools of Monetary Policy”, presidential address at the American Economic Association Annual Meeting, January.</span><span
