    <h2> Clare Distinguished Lecture in Economics and Public Policy by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB organised by the Clare College, University of Cambridge Cambridge, 10 December 2009 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)"> Systemic Risk Clare Distinguished Lecture in Economics and Public Policyby Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBorganised by the Clare College, University of CambridgeCambridge, 10 December 2009 Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to have been invited by Clare College, Cambridge, to give this lecture in economics and public policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">One of the greatest challenges for economics and public policy at this time is to restore financial and economic stability, and to improve the future functioning of financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">A pre-condition for meeting this challenge is a deep understanding of the nature of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And that is the topic I have chosen for this lecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Systemic risk in Europe’s financial system is a very important issue for the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">And as an institution of the 27, through its General Council in particular, the ECB is one of the continent’s guardians of economic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">We are charged in particular with maintaining price stability in the euro area over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">But the ECB is also an active participant in the new agenda of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">As you will be aware, restoring financial stability and containing systemic risk in the future are at the heart of the supervisory and regulatory reforms currently being discussed here in Europe and elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">I am particularly pleased to give this lecture at Cambridge University, which has been an intellectual “powerhouse” for centuries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">It is said that the university has more Nobel Prize winners associated with it than any other institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.95,0)">Perhaps the most well known Nobel Laureate from Clare College is James Watson, who, together with Francis Crick, derived the structure of DNA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">DNA incorporates the building blocks of life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">As the recent instability illustrates, we economists still need to achieve as clear an understanding of the building blocks of financial systems – not simply the institutions small and large that populate them, but also the fundamentals of the rules and incentives that drive their behaviour; and, particularly, how they combine and interact with each other in the presence of amplification mechanisms stemming from leverage and other forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Let me mention two more recent Nobel laureates in economics whose work relates to my topic today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">In 1996, James Mirrlees of Trinity College won the Nobel Prize for his contributions to the economic theory of incentives under incomplete information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">In 2001 Joseph Stiglitz, who spent time in Cambridge in the 1960s, won the Prize for his analysis of the functioning of markets when information is asymmetrically distributed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I shall argue in my lecture that such information problems and the incentives that they provide for economic behaviour are one important element in the phenomenon of systemic risk, and therefore in the wide transmission of financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.58,0)">The nature of systemic risk So what is systemic risk?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.65,0)">In the context of our natural environment, it is the threat that the actions of millions of individuals, all acting in pursuit of their own interests, can cause a breakdown of the world’s ecosystem, a global catastrophe which will ultimately damage everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This, of course, is the topic of the international climate change negotiations this week and next in Copenhagen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.36,0)">Similarly, in the context of our economic environment, it is the threat that developments in the financial system can cause a seizing-up or breakdown of this system and trigger massive damages to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.25,0)">Such developments can stem from the failure of large and interconnected institutions, from endogenous imbalances that add up over time, or from a sizable unexpected event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.45,0)">A seizing-up of the financial system – or large parts of it – is what we experienced last autumn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.07,0)">The consequence was an economic freefall, a surge in unemployment and a massive increase in public debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.55,0)">So what is it about financial systems that make them prone to systemic risk?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The financial system is composed of intermediaries, markets and the infrastructure of payment, settlement and trading mechanisms that support them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Intermediaries are connected with each other through direct transactions, as in interbank markets, and through similar investment and financing decisions with third parties such as other intermediaries or end investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Financial markets, in turn, are connected with each other through the trading activities of financial intermediaries and through end investors active in more than one market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.73,0)">Systemic risk within the financial system relates to the risk that these inter-connections and similarities render emerging financial instability widespread in the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Even if the original problem seems more contained, important amplification mechanisms can be at work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This complex network of financial connections is extended through the savings and financing needs of all economic sectors, notably non-financial firms, households and the government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">By reallocating savings from individuals and sectors with a surplus of funds to individuals and sectors in need of funds, the financial system plays a central role in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.7,0)">So, systemic risk, in a broader sense, relates to the risk that widespread instabilities in the financial system translate into adverse effects on growth and welfare in the economy at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.92,0)">How is it that financial instability can be triggered by initially self-contained events, which are then transmitted so widely that the fallout ultimately reaches systemic dimensions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">ECB research by Philipp Hartmann and others, which has investigated systemic risk for at least a decade, suggests that there are three particularly important ways in which this can happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.46,0)">The first is contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.36,0)">The failure of one financial intermediary can lead to failures of other financial intermediaries, even when the latter have not invested in the same risks and are not subject to the same original shock as the former.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.91,0)">Second, widespread financial imbalances can build up over time and then unwind abruptly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Hyman Minsky described how in good times consumption and investment increase, generating income, which fuels the financing of more consumption and investment but also the neglect of increasing risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.51,0)">Even small events can then lead to a re-pricing of risk and an endogenous unravelling of the credit boom, which then adversely affects many intermediaries and markets at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.23,0)">Third, negative aggregate shocks can adversely affect intermediaries and markets simultaneously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.18,0)">Historical research has shown that many banking crises were related to economic downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.77,0)">There are a number of features of financial systems that make them particularly prone to these forms of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me just highlight three key ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.43,0)">The first pervasive feature of financial systems is what we call externalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">They particularly relate to the complex and dynamic network of exposures among major intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.76,0)">What in tranquil times is an efficient mechanism to share risk, can, in times of stress, become a dangerous channel for transmitting instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.22,0)">Two contracting parties do not have an incentive to take account of the effects of their risk-taking on third parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As a consequence, the risk at the level of the system may be higher than the sum of individual risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The second key feature of financial systems is asymmetric information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Financial systems allocate funds from agents who have them but possess no specific knowledge about promising investment opportunities, to agents who have knowledge about the opportunities but not the funds to engage in them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.25,0)">This creates an agency problem between the two parties, which may be handled more or less well through the underlying financial contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.32,0)">If contracts are incomplete and negative news arrive on some of the investment projects, but information asymmetries do not allow lenders to judge whether this also affects other investment projects, funding may evaporate for all projects alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.79,0)">The special nature of financial systems is not simply characterised by the presence of these two imperfections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.17,0)">Externalities and information problems are also present in other economic sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.58,0)">The additional problem in the financial system is that they can result in the third feature: powerful feedback and amplification mechanisms, which render their implications more severe and widespread.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.7,0)">Illiquid assets, maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities and leverage amplify the force with which problems of one intermediary are pushed through the complex network of exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.76,0)">Sizable amounts of debt relative to capital and short-term funding have more dramatic effects in situations of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.52,0)">For example, intermediaries’ losses can trigger “fire sales” of already largely illiquid assets, which reduce their values and cause losses to other intermediaries, as for example described in research on contagion by Hyun Shin and his co-authors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.88,0)">Moreover, funding and market illiquidity can reinforce each other, leading to vicious liquidity spirals multiplying the initial shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">These effects are further amplified due to asymmetric information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.76,0)">In the aggregate, they lead to the nonlinear adjustments that are so characteristic of financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.94,0)">The fact that such adjustments are nonlinear is particularly important for research and makes modelling extremely difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.61,0)">Such adjustments may cause violent regime changes, pushing the system from a state of tranquillity to a state of turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">One key element in phases of turmoil and crisis is speed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.14,0)">The rapidity of unfolding developments is often not modelled explicitly, but it is one of the greatest challenges for policy makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Financial crises are by no means new phenomena, but the speed of their transmission has accelerated tremendously over the past few decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.21,0)">While the unfolding of the sovereign debt crises in the 1980’s occurred over the course of years, the Asian Financial crisis developed, at its peak, over months rather than years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.81,0)">The last intensification of the present crisis, starting in mid-September last year, has spread around the globe in the course of half-days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Many factors have contributed to this acceleration, including the process of global financial integration, the increasing leverage in institutions, the technological advancements that allow for an instantaneous transmission of information world-wide and the accumulation over a long period of time of unsustainable global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.99,0)">In the eco-systems of our natural environment, feedback mechanisms are often prevalent, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.94,0)">As soon as one part of the system is adversely affected, this can take the form of an adverse feedback look destabilising the system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.24,0)">Amplification effects are not only important in the transmission of instability, but also in the build-up of imbalances that sow the seeds of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">A very important phenomenon in this regard is herd behaviour in investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.92,0)">For example, investment managers and loan officers may sometimes ignore valuable private information in order to mimic others when their own evaluation, their own remuneration or their own external reputation depends on their performance relative to the rest of the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.19,0)">This behaviour is individually rational but socially wasteful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Here at the University of Cambridge, the famous analogy that John Maynard Keynes made between newspaper beauty contests and financial market behaviour comes to mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.54,0)">I am also convinced that one of the main reasons behind herd behaviour in financial markets in general, particularly in times of crisis, is a lack of transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The fostering of transparency as concerns financial institutions, financial markets and financial products is therefore one essential policy lesson from the present crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Our latest experience with systemic risk Let me now apply the relevant elements of this framework on how to think about systemic risk to the present crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.28,0)">A particularly relevant source of systemic risk was the build-up of widespread financial imbalances – the second form of systemic risk I described – in the period of 2003 to 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The years prior to 2007 were characterised by low financial market volatility and risk premia, rapid financial innovation in credit markets, low interest rates across the maturity spectrum and ample liquidity conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In particular, rapid financial innovation led to securitisation techniques with thus far unknown complexities and to long and uncontrollable chains of intermediaries between originators and final investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Ratings agencies gained global power as the pricing of securitisation tranches was largely based on their assessment, while leverage mounted ever higher and a shadow banking system developed up largely unregulated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.32,0)">At the same time, mark-to-market accounting rules became increasingly widespread, while unsustainable external deficits and surpluses in some major economies paved the way for macroeconomic imbalances at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Information began to flow instantaneously around the globe and raised competitive pressure on all financial market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In this environment, banks and other investors engaged in a “search for yield” with the help of the new credit products and investment vehicles, circumventing existing regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The pace of this herd behaviour into ever more complicated forms of securitisation far exceeded the market’s capacity to solve a number of open issues of valuation, risk management and incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.03,0)">The result were widespread financial potential instabilities in the form of a highly complex, opaque and – as it turned out later – illiquid system of credit risk distribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.27,0)">Many investors were either ignorant or imprudent with regard to the risks that they had acquired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.45,0)">Contrary to conventional wisdom, this distribution led to much less diversification than thought and to some surprising concentrations of risks in a number of large and complex financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.58,0)">While mortgage market exposures, including those in US sub-prime mortgages, were part of the problem, it later turned out that the problem of bad assets was much more widespread.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.2,0)">The underlying risks started to materialise when house prices declined, delinquencies in US sub-prime mortgage markets rose, and the so-called ‘special purpose vehicles’ that held highly concentrated exposures to these markets came under pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.34,0)">In June and July 2007, credit default swap premia started to increase sharply, rating agencies downgraded a large number of asset-backed securities and collateralised debt obligations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.61,0)">Even AAA-rated CDO index tranches declined below par value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.57,0)">The eventual instability became systemic for the first time when money markets became impaired in early August 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.93,0)">The re-pricing of risks made the major intermediaries active in interbank markets aware that they might experience further losses in the future and that the same might apply to their counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.04,0)">Given the lack of transparency of the credit risk distribution system, asymmetric information was omnipresent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.11,0)">It became difficult for intermediaries to distinguish good assets and counterparties from bad ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.62,0)">This led banks to hoard liquidity as a protection against the risk of their own assets and counterparties becoming illiquid, rather than lending available funds in money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.32,0)">Such malfunctioning of the interbank markets makes the problem immediately systemic, as all major banks depend on those markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.3,0)">For central banks, there was no alternative to making sizable liquidity interventions aimed at keeping the system afloat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.19,0)">While this first phase of what we described at the time as “market turmoil” was indeed very challenging, the dramatic transition to a full-blown systemic crisis happened in September 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.91,0)">The failure of a very large US investment bank, in conjunction with other news and a series of events that increased uncertainty, led to a widespread loss of confidence in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.69,0)">As a consequence, the economic outlook worsened dramatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.01,0)">The economic models in use were not able to predict the sharp downward revisions of growth figures that followed over the subsequent seven months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.9,0)">The events of September 2008 clearly showed that in economic policy, we have no good understanding of the very rapid transition to an eventual systemic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.51,0)">In this sense, we were left alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.27,0)">Policy-makers had to rely on informal information, real-time data releases and their own wisdom and judgements on how the situation was evolving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">What have we learned from this experience in terms of identifying those structural trends in financial systems that are important for systemic risk?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">First, we need much more analysis of the implications of the business models of major intermediaries for the system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Some of the crucial factors, whose relative importance has shifted over time, include originate-to-distribute models, rising maturity mismatches and the combination of proprietary trading and investment advice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.29,0)">Second, in line with previous experiences we have been reminded that the very fast growth of innovative financial instruments and new financial intermediaries, in particular off-balance sheet vehicles, can imply significant risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Third, financial integration needs to be accompanied by reform of supervisory and regulatory approaches and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Major reforms in this area are currently being discussed in the European Council and European Parliament, including the establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.36,0)">Fourth, advancing financial consolidation raises the question of how to regulate and, in the event, wind down large and complex financial intermediaries whose disorderly failure could pose systemic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Fifth and finally, as financial sectors develop, households may take greater risks, for example in mortgage markets and, more broadly, in their pension investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">While this also raises issues of consumer protection, from a systemic perspective, it becomes increasingly important to know how resilient the household sector and consumption can be in such a situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Macro-prudential supervision: a policy response to systemic risk I have discussed the nature of systemic risk and our latest experience of it in the present crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Let me now turn to the question of how policy-makers can respond to systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Today, I want to focus particularly on the challenges for policy-makers of detecting risks of systemic instability materialising in the future, and of then containing these risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.36,0)">Detecting systemic risks early is the task of macro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I would like to focus on the analytical issues underlying this policy and stress three approaches, linking them to the three forms of systemic risk I discussed at the start of my lecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">First, there are large and complex financial intermediaries, or like-minded clusters of financial institutions, that play prominent roles in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">We can describe them as particularly important “nodes” in the financial network, which stand out through their risk, size and interconnectedness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The full understanding of their individual on- and off-balance sheet exposures and their lending and borrowing to each other is a crucial element in assessing and containing risks of contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Second, the extent and diversity of investment practices across all segments of the financial system requires particular attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.0,0)">For example, fast-growing credit to similar sectors or regions could be a sign of vulnerabilities building up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.86,0)">The imbalances might become unsustainable later and unravel in a disorderly fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.4,0)">This risk requires looking at early-warning signals in current market data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">For example, aggregate credit might grow at a pace that is disproportionate to the credit required to finance sustainable investment and consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.89,0)">The complete set of important intermediaries, markets and instruments also needs to be checked for early-warning signals, since similar risks could be hidden in different parts of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.38,0)">Third, current market data may not give the full picture of all relevant future scenarios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.74,0)">Detecting systemic risks early also requires stress-testing the system against extreme events and shocks that would surprise markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Such macro-stress tests help to make an assessment of the resilience of financial systems against shocks that have a low probability but a highly destabilising power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.34,0)">Compared to the vision of systemic risk that I have outlined so far, two weaknesses of the supervisory and regulatory approach that we had before the crisis stand out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.94,0)">For one thing, the old approach focused too much on individual risks and too little on interconnections across intermediaries and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">For another thing, it generated a lot of information about some types of intermediaries but much less on others  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.73,0)">This made it difficult to understand fully the pro-cyclical behaviour of the system in the aggregate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Even if we understand the nature of systemic risk and know the basic approaches for detecting its different forms, there are very important challenges for macro-prudential supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">One challenge is to be able to collect all the information that is necessary to identify systemic risks early.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It requires combining some micro-level data with and aggregate data from components of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This means covering major types of intermediaries, in particular large and complex ones, key markets and wholesale market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">To contain systemic risk, macro-prudential supervisors need to have a good understanding of all parts of the financial system that are relevant for the risks of contagion, the endogenous build-up and unravelling of widespread imbalances and macro shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.66,0)">Some of these data are more difficult to compile and bring together than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.53,0)">There are some financial sectors about which considerably less is known than about others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Compare, for example, banks or insurance companies with non-listed highly leveraged institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Although nowadays individual hedge funds do not seem to be a source of significant systemic risk, it is very important that the relevance of this industry for the overall cyclicality of the financial system is assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">A particularly complicated topic is measuring the interconnectedness among the systemically most important intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The implication is that an effective exchange of information between the functions of macro-prudential supervision and micro-prudential supervision is an essential element of identifying and containing systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">There will be strong demands on micro and macro-prudential supervisors to ensure smooth exchange of information under the post-crisis regulatory and supervisory regime we are striving to establish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.37,0)">Another challenge is more of an analytical nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The economic models we have at our disposal at present do not capture necessarily all relevant dimensions of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.11,0)">For example, despite progress in developing macro-stress testing frameworks, there are still limitations in how economic analysis captures the two-sided interaction between financial instability and the performance of the broader economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.57,0)">Standard macroeconomic models often do not have a well developed financial sector and are linear in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.69,0)">As I have noted, systemic instability involves major nonlinearities and, in any case, cannot be analysed without proper representation of the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.56,0)">There are many good finance approaches to the topic of financial instability, but they are often not aggregate enough to capture realistic features of the macroeconomy, including for example the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Speaking here in the intellectual “powerhouse” of the University of Cambridge, I therefore call on the academic research community to make major efforts towards a better integration of financial and macroeconomic analyses to address these limitations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">A final challenge is given by the policy instruments available to contain systemic risks beyond monitoring and warning about them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Macro-prudential regulation is a relatively new policy area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">We have much experience of how micro-prudential regulation affects the stability of financial intermediaries and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">A much more complex matter is using regulatory tools to stabilise the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Having said that, I nevertheless see very encouraging discussions and progress on this front.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">For example, the 2009 Geneva Report on the World Economy on “The fundamental principles of financial regulation” points the way to how regulators can determine higher capital requirements for financial intermediaries that exhibit features enhancing systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.04,0)">Additional capital for interconnectedness, leverage, maturity mismatch and asset growth will limit the scope for the externalities I was discussing before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">New initiatives are also under way to enhance the transparency of financial activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">These will help to limit the adverse effects of imperfect and asymmetric information on systemic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Overall, a great deal of work is going on at the Financial Stability Board, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and at other competent bodies to strengthen the macro-prudential dimension of financial regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">As with climate change, an effective policy response demands international coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.14,0)">Global warming has been called the biggest market failure ever; the present crisis has been perhaps the biggest financial market failure ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">We know from basic theory and practice that addressing market failure requires a major and coordinated policy response, both immediate and in the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.29,0)">Systemic risk and macroeconomic stabilisation policies I have identified the endogenous build-up and subsequent unravelling of financial imbalances, as driven for example by herd behaviour in investment, leverage to finance investment exposures and complex and opaque financial contracts, as a particularly relevant form of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.25,0)">While macro-prudential supervision is at the forefront of preventing severe asset bubbles from emerging, this may not be sufficient, given the macroeconomic components of cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Therefore, macroeconomic stabilisation policies need to make their contribution to reducing pro-cyclicality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.66,0)">Macroeconomic authorities have faced the challenge posed by financial booms and busts in two ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">First and foremost through solid institutions: the pre-emptive arm against system instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Stability-oriented macroeconomic frameworks have ensured price stability and economic prosperity in all developed countries for the last quarter of a century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Demand and real incomes have grown steeply, but steadily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Their steady course has instilled a wide sense of security in investors and savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The European stability culture can be seen as vindicated by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.09,0)">However, macroeconomic stability has not been a sufficient condition for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It cannot eliminated systemic risk altogether.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.3,0)">Macroeconomic authorities have therefore been frequently called on to provide remedial action, once booms have turned into busts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The aim of their action has been precisely to avoid the transformation of individual financial risks into systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.72,0)">Ex post remedial action has often been activated as soon as the financial firestorm has threatened the stability of the economic system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">But such action risks raising expectations that macroeconomic policy will always insure against tail risks, no matter how large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.34,0)">Expectations of this sort can contribute to an under-pricing of financial risk in subsequent phases of the financial cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">They can encourage concentration of market positions in the financial scene.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.54,0)">At the same time, the instruments of counter-cyclical policy have been used so intensely – and more so from one financial cycle to the next – that authorities might have tested the extremes of their control procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I am borrowing here from dynamic control theory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.1,0)">Repeated attempts to fine tune a mechanical or electronic system after a shock sometimes leads to “instrument instability” that makes the system spiral out of manageable bounds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Economic and financial systems, I suspect could have some structural similarities with physical systems, leading to the same kind of “instrument instability”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.55,0)">Moral hazard and policy instrument instability pose questions to which we are not in a position to a firm answer at this point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I would like to see these questions studied and debated in eminent academic institutions like this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.34,0)">Turning to actual developments, as I mentioned already, we saw perhaps the most appalling manifestation of such a threat in the autumn of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.4,0)">In the early phase of the present financial crisis, precautionary hoarding of liquidity brought to a complete seizure of many segments of the market for credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.25,0)">At the same time, panic sales of assets made market liquidity disappear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Market liquidity is high when traders can easily find a price, and that price is very close to what every other trader pays for the same asset at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.38,0)">In early October 2008 the market could simply not find a value for many of those securities that had been so highly priced only few weeks before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">To avoid a cascade of counterparty defaults, governments offered generous financial guarantees and injected fresh capital into the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Central banks increased their lending to replace the withdrawal of private lending – in interbank transactions and, sometimes, in the broader market for capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.1,0)">This concerted intervention very much attenuated the downward part of the cycle and blocked channels of financial contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In short, it provided catastrophe insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">There is no doubt that macroeconomic policy-makers’ interventions have had a stabilising effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Market compensation for risk has gradually returned to more normal levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.2,0)">The free-fall of the economy has been halted and turned around.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.54,0)">The financial crisis has not precipitated the extreme spiral of falling prices, rising debt burdens and chain bankruptcies that some economists had feared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.19,0)">For what concerns monetary policy, conditions are now stable enough that we can start to withdraw some of the excess support that is now not needed to the same extent as it was in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Concluding remarks Let me draw to a close.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.87,0)">An English proverb, echoed in many other languages, warns that sometimes, ‘you can’t see the wood for the trees’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Systemic risk is about seeing the wood, and not only the trees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.22,0)">Macro-prudential supervision, supposed to detect systemic risk and propose remedial action, has been devised because in a highly integrated and complex financial system, micro-prudential supervision alone can no longer guarantee financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The main challenge in systemic risk analysis is therefore to integrate all relevant perspectives, including those of economists, supervisors, regulators, accountants, securitisation experts, rating experts, risk managers and many others to take a holistic view on the system, its dynamics and its interlinkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.52,0)">As we have seen, small things can make a big difference and seemingly self-contained initial events can lead to a system collapse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We therefore need a detailed understanding of each part of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">At the same time, their complex interactions mean that we need to keep the big picture in sight, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.28,0)">We must not allow the understandably narrow focus of detailed knowledge to hamper insight into the system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Like researchers on the climate and the natural environment, we need to combine the micro and macro perspectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The academic research community can make a significant contribution in supporting policy-makers to meet these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">It can help to improve analytical frameworks for the early identification and assessment of systemic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">And it can contribute to discussions on the further identification and optimal use of macro-prudential regulatory instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Macro-prudential supervision is an important tool to contain systemic risks and thereby contribute to sustainable growth and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">The proposed establishment of a European Systemic Risk Board next year is a very important initiative in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Ensuring systemic stability will also alleviate undue pressures on monetary and fiscal policies to extend financial safety nets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The standard macroeconomic stabilisation policies can then focus more clearly on their primary objectives and thereby make their own best contribution to growth and well-being.</span><span
