    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)"> Retail payments at a crossroads Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at a joint conference by the European Central Bank and the Banque de France, “Retail Payments at a Crossroads: Economics, Strategies and Future Policies”,Paris, 21 October 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen  , It is a great pleasure for me to make some introductory remarks at this conference on the different roads that may lie ahead for retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">But first of all, I would like to thank the Banque de France for organising this conference jointly with the ECB, and for hosting it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">I am also grateful to Christian Noyer for opening this event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">I am sure we will spend two fruitful days having some valuable discussions and exchanges on the economics, strategies and policies of retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Four years ago, in 2009, the ECB and the De Nederlandsche Bank organised the first conference of this kind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The idea behind the conference was to foster the dialogue between academics and policy-makers in the field of retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The second conference was organised with the Oesterreichische Nationalbank in 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And this is the third conference in the series.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">It shows that we are committed to building on the progress achieved and keeping the dialogue going.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Before the crisis, the retail payments business went largely unnoticed as a substantial source of revenue in banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">During the crisis, as was outlined in the 2009 conference, the retail payments business had been resilient, providing reliable and regular revenues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">As a result, the subsequent realisation that banks with more stable funding models were better able to cope with the crisis has led in recent years to a greater recognition of the importance of retail banking and retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Indeed, one of the conclusions drawn at the 2011 conference was that retail payments have also become more socially relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Businesses and individuals must have cheap and easy access to basic retail payment services in order to pursue their economic activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">The further development of retail payments is a key factor in financial inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">I will come back to this issue later today in my panel discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.0,0)">That said, the social costs of retail payment instruments, including cash and non-cash payments, remain substantial, as a recent ECB study has shown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Those costs amount to almost 1% of GDP in Europe, with considerable differences from country to country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.62,0)">In the title of the conference we say that retail payments are at a crossroads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.83,0)">This means that the road we now follow will profoundly affect retail payment economics, strategies and policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Different roads may appeal in different ways to the various economic actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">One possibility would be to preserve the status quo and to implement only the changes needed to comply with the existing regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Alternatively, we could follow a road less travelled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Here, new economic actors may emerge and consumers may start to utilise more personalised, simple and secure payment services and applications offered by the information and consumption channels they increasingly   use, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">smartphones and the internet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Also, payment service providers may push forward into the uncharted territories of further retail payments integration and innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I would like to elaborate on the different roads ahead, considering integration first and then innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Retail payments integration Without wanting to pre-empt Michel Barnier’s keynote speech on retail payments and their contribution to the Single Market, let me say that retail payment integration in the euro area – and in Europe – has made progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Although there are still considerable efforts to be made, we are just a few weeks away from completing the migration to new European schemes that have been developed for credit transfers and direct debits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">It’s a big step forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.71,0)">But progress in the field of cards has been slower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">We are still far from a situation where “any card can be used at any terminal”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">To ensure a level playing field, national borders for cards licensing, issuing and acquiring have to disappear, and the consistent implementation of the separation of scheme management and processing has to be ensured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Some movement in this area is expected to result from the revised Payment Services Directive and Regulation on interchange fees for cards  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Regarding standardisation, despite some progress made during the last years, further work is required, as recommended by the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The question remains whether in future retail payments integration will be mainly a compliance-driven process or whether it can be pushed further, making electronic payments more widely used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Currently, there is evidence of cross-country convergence in the euro area, especially for cards, direct debits and credit transfers, and the speed of convergence has clearly accelerated for most of the payment instruments studied since the introduction of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Despite the convergence, however, there are still large differences in payment behaviour, starting with a choice between cash or cashless payments and then, say, selecting from a range of cashless payment instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.3,0)">For instance, the persistent use of cheques in some countries, even though it is steadily declining, shows that payment behaviour changes slowly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">This also means that cash remains an important means of payment in the foreseeable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Therefore, the Eurosystem continues in its efforts to protect the integrity of the euro banknotes and stay ahead of counterfeiters, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">with the introduction of our new series of euro banknotes, called the Europa series.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Promoting further integration of retail payments in Europe is seen as economically and socially advantageous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">There is empirical evidence that initiatives to integrate and harmonise retail payment markets boost trade and consumption and benefit the whole economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Data from 27 markets in Europe between 1995 and 2009 confirms that the shift to efficient electronic retail payments stimulates overall economic growth, consumption and trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This effect is most pronounced for card payments, followed by credit transfers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Deeper integration of retail payments is expected to bring about more price convergence among cashless retail payment instruments in the euro area, making those instruments more affordable and thereby promoting financial inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The Single Euro Payments Area   is instrumental in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Later this week, the ECB will publish the second SEPA migration report, which will highlight the progress accomplished and the remaining challenges as we come closer to the SEPA end-date of 1 February 2014 for migration to pan-European payment instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As recalled by the SEPA Council at its 23rd September meeting, the SEPA migration requirements set by law have to be fully respected without exception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Looking beyond the end-date, the ECB will establish and chair the Euro Retail Payments Board   as successor of the SEPA Council to contribute to and to facilitate the creation of an integrated, competitive, innovative and level playing field market for euro retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The ambition is for the ERPB to achieve a wider membership, strengthened mandate and a more output-driven approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">I look forward to the active participation of the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">At present, financial inclusion is lower in those countries which make less use of cashless retail payment instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Giving more people, especially those on lower incomes, access to financial services not only adds to economic growth, but also plays a part in reducing income inequality and poverty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">In this way, it can help to achieve higher social welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">At the same time, it can integrate payment flows that currently exist outside the formal financial sector and strengthen the social role of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.47,0)">This matters enormously as Europe is emerging from a protracted crisis that has put its social model under strain and shattered public trust in the financial industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">To sum up, I would say that there are strong economic, social and political reasons for retail payment service providers, users and regulators to aim for further retail payments integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">European regulation is essential in paving the way, but there are many other roads to follow for providers and users to reap the full benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Retail payments innovation As I said earlier, e-commerce and new communication and information media have set new challenges in terms of functionality and security for retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">They have also given providers of payment-related services new opportunities to compete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">These chances are valuable because, as we know, competition is good for business, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">it should provide users with more choices and better services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Unfortunately, these opportunities have not yet been fully exploited by the different market players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Innovative retail payment solutions in the euro area are still largely being provided by non-bank service providers, mainly for the payment initiation phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.97,0)">Banks – the traditional payment service providers – are at a crossroads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">They can either try to defend their existing products and leave this business segment to non-bank providers, or they can become more open and innovative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.05,0)">If they go down the first road, they risk ending up in the unpleasant situation of, say, bookshops confronted with the rise of online competitors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The ability to maintain a diversified business model, including through retail banking, will be key to the profitability and resilience of the European banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.24,0)">One reason for adopting a defensive posture may be that, until recently, most banks heavily relied on interchange fees for cards in their business model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.34,0)">But this business model is being increasingly challenged in a number of countries and jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I mentioned earlier the proposal for a Regulation on interchange fees for cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">This has the potential to break the stalemate that has occurred not only in the cards dossier but also on the innovation front.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Transparency and clarity with respect to the real costs and benefits of cards and other payment instruments are vital for a harmonised and innovative European retail payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.62,0)">Another reason for a defensive posture may be that banks face a coordination issue within their own organisations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.25,0)">For one thing, retail payments are often perceived as a cost centre, not as a profit centre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Moreover, innovations in retail payments require investments in IT as well as the will to challenge well-established and profitable business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.3,0)">Clearly, these are not easy things to do in times of financial distress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In the end, whoever provides innovative payment services should be mindful of two key issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">First, those services should be safe and protected against misuse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">For instance, it is necessary that clear conditions are established under which payment initiation services offered by third-party service providers can use access to existing online banking systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Second, innovative services should have the potential to become pan-European solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.9,0)">If we do not think about the European dimension right from the start, in a few years’ time we will face all the problems of having to merge multiple national solutions into a European framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">I said earlier that retail payments integration brings benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The same thing applies to innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Fostering retail payments innovation is socially important as it should help to lower costs and reduce entry barriers, and promote financial inclusion among the underbanked and the unbanked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Conclusion I have only touched upon a number of very important issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">I am confident that today and tomorrow, these issues will be explored in greater depth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Taken together, the speakers, panellists, chairs and discussants at this conference as well as you in the audience possess a vast body of knowledge and expertise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">If all those assets are put to good use in choosing the future direction, I am confident that the right road will be found.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Retail payments have reached a turning point as regards integration and innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">As in the famous poem by Robert Frost  , the road that will be travelled by will make all the difference – economically and socially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span
