    <span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)"> Stability and growth in the euro area – who plays the leading role?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, IEP Mittagsgespräch, 30 June 2017 Ladies and gentlemen, Most of us probably go to the theatre from time to time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.77,0)">And we are all aware that theatre is more than just entertainment; often it deals with the fundamental questions of life, with major conflicts and their resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Theatre holds a mirror up to life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.34,0)">In classical drama, this always follows the same structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.94,0)">The story evolves over the course of four acts and is then resolved in the fifth act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">And when we look at the story of the euro area, we see this very same structure – it is just the fifth act that remains to be written.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But let us begin by taking a look at the first four acts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.25,0)">The first act of a drama is the exposition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The audience is introduced to the characters and the circumstances in which they live.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.92,0)">In the case of the euro area, this act is quite long – it lasted from 1999 to 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.31,0)">In the second act, the tension rises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.93,0)">In the autumn of 2008, the global financial crisis hits the euro area; barely one and a half years later, Greece gets into difficulties – the beginning of the sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">The pace of the story picks up as it heads towards its climax.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.47,0)">The climax comes in the third act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.54,0)">We are in the year 2012, and it is no longer just about the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.39,0)">The sovereign debt crisis has spread to several euro area countries, and even some of the larger ones are under pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.11,0)">Some market participants and politicians are no longer ruling out the possibility that the euro area might break up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.67,0)">In the fourth act, the pace of the action begins to slow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The crisis has passed and the economy begins to recover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.74,0)">But in this act there is always a final moment of suspense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.76,0)">The action falters and tension rises again – think of the elections in France.bond And what now, ladies and gentlemen?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.69,0)">What is going to happen in the fifth act?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">How will the story of the euro area continue?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let us spend some time thinking about that question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.85,0)">Who plays the leading role – the ECB or policymakers?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The first thing we need to have, of course, is a main character.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Everyone would probably agree that the ECB is currently playing the leading role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, there would no doubt be differences of opinion regarding the nature of that role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.68,0)">Some would say that the ECB is a villain who picks savers’ pockets, who redistributes risk and wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Others would say that the ECB is a reluctant hero: when others fail, it reluctantly steps in and saves the world – or at least the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.04,0)">In my view, the ECB plays neither of these two roles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In fact, the ECB is allowed to play one role only, and that role is clearly defined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The ECB has to safeguard price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.13,0)">To be more precise: in the medium term, inflation should be below, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">I admit that it has been a challenge to live up to that role in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.34,0)">The weak economy and low inflation have obliged the ECB to pursue a very loose monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This includes the use of some unconventional instruments – bond purchases, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Even though I am critical of some of these instruments, an expansionary monetary policy stance was generally appropriate in order to fulfil our role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Nonetheless, I consider it imperative that monetary policy should return to normal as soon as can be justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.26,0)">This is because unusually loose monetary policy does not just have the intended effect, it always has undesired side-effects too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Among other things, it increases the risk of asset price bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And with time, these undesired risks become larger, while the desired effects wear off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Against this backdrop, monetary policy has to adjust at the right time, which is as soon as inflation is on a stable path towards our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.14,0)">We therefore look at how inflation is evolving over the medium term, not at temporary blips in one direction or the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Even if no stable trend is visible as yet, it is important to prepare for different times, for there is reason to be optimistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The euro area economy is recovering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">For the past four years, it has been growing slowly but steadily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">And the recovery has become more broad-based, while risks to growth are now balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Funding is becoming easier and easier for companies, more loans are being granted and more investments are being made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The mood among businesses and consumers is correspondingly good – relevant indicators are at their highest levels since the crisis started in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Thus, although inflation is not yet on a stable path towards our objective, all the conditions are in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.33,0)">It is just a question of time and patience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">That is why monetary policy should already be making preparations for a return to a normal stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">And it should adapt its communication accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">To sum up, the role of the ECB is to safeguard price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">That is important, but it is not enough for a leading role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">That part is for others to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And those others are to be found in the field of politics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I am referring to the national parliaments and governments in the euro area and to the European Union’s institutions – the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.42,0)">They are the main characters, particularly in the fifth act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Only they can take the story of the euro area forward in a way that is beneficial for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is only they who can bring about the much-needed reforms, and it is only they who have the democratic mandate to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.18,0)">For that reason alone, it is politicians who have to play the leading role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And it is you, ladies and gentlemen, you, the voters in the euro area, who stand behind them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">You elect the people who will decide how this story continues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.46,0)">The fifth act – how will the story continue?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.63,0)">Regarding elections, for some time we have had to watch as the mood of voters going to the ballot box has become increasingly critical towards Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">But, looking at the recent elections in France, it seems that this has now changed – and rightly so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">After all, a united Europe and a single currency have more to offer than some people may believe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And here, I am not only thinking of the economic benefits, but also of the political benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.47,0)">In particular, I am thinking of global politics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The global stage is dominated by large countries, such as the United States, China and Russia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">If we Europeans want to continue playing a role on that stage, and if we want to be heard, then we have to speak as one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">From climate change to security policy, we have to speak with one voice – ideally with the voice of reason.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">From this perspective, a united Europe does not look like an unnecessary luxury; instead, it looks like a fundamental necessity in order to ensure that the people of Europe have the ability to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And then there’s the economic side of a united Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The single market gives companies access to around 500 million consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">This allows them to reap economies of scale and to lower costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">At the same time, greater competition ensures lower prices, which in turn benefits consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">That is the basic idea of the single European market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The euro takes this idea one step further: a single currency for a single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Companies can do business across the entire euro area without having to worry about exchange rate risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">And I am sure that each of us appreciates being able to travel through Europe without having to change money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.75,0)">And it’s not just about travelling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.26,0)">In a united Europe, anyone can live where he or she wants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, as you may already sense, if I were able to write the fifth act of the euro area’s story, it would be very European.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">The citizens of Europe would seize the opportunity provided by the crisis and the new global situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">They would reflect on their similarities and move closer together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">True, that is easier said than done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">After all, Europe is very diverse: different languages, different cultures, different perspectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">But should that keep us from coming closer together and becoming a bit more European?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.27,0)">I don’t think so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Diversity enriches life – bringing together different perspectives and experiences broadens our horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">It also helps us to solve problems – both our own problems and those we share with others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It is no coincidence that the motto of the EU is “united in diversity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.49,0)">When we look at the economy, however, diversity becomes more tricky, particularly in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">And the countries of the euro area are indeed very diverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">They are diverse in terms of the specialisation and orientation of their economies – and this is certainly an advantage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">But they are also diverse in the sense that their economies differ in terms of efficiency and resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.6,0)">That can cause problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.78,0)">The crisis is a case in point: while some countries weathered it relatively well, others were hit quite hard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.43,0)">And if one member of a monetary union gets into trouble, it affects all the others as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In that regard, we are all in the same boat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.98,0)">The question is how to deal with it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Naturally, the first step is to try to prevent crises from happening in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Euro area countries have to become more efficient, and they have to become more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.97,0)">Even then, no one can rule out the possibility that a country might be hit by a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And that leads us to the question of how we deal with this risk, of who should bear what risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In essence, there are two options.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First, such risks could be shared via the public sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">That is what happened during the crisis: European taxpayers stepped in to help those countries that had been hit the hardest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Second, such risks could be shared via the market – this would certainly be the better option for taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let us take a closer look at all these things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">The architecture of the euro area – the ingredients for a successful fifth act The first step is clear: the countries of the euro area have to become more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.59,0)">But there’s a twist: members of a monetary union lack a crucial tool with which to offset economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.82,0)">They lack an exchange rate of their own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.31,0)">While countries outside a monetary union can devalue or revalue their currency to rebalance their economy, those inside a monetary union need to make adjustments through other channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, many countries first have to open up those channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">They have to make their economies sustainable and more competitive with the aid of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.19,0)">Take labour markets, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">In many countries, labour markets are rigid Flexible labour markets could help to mitigate shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.06,0)">They ensure that crises do not lead to persistently high unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">At the same time, flexible labour markets help the economy to grow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">They facilitate the change that is needed to reap the benefits of a united Europe and a globalised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">But if the benefits of flexible labour markets are truly to reach the people, there is something else that we need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We need a good system of education and training – one that starts in kindergarten and accompanies people for the rest of their lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The better this system is, the more flexible labour markets can be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As well as labour markets, the banking system also plays an important role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.28,0)">Only sound banks can cope when loans go bad in a downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.7,0)">And in a downturn, only sound banks can provide funds to promising companies and thus prepare for the next upturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">And here, a lot has been done since the crisis – even though some banks still need to do more homework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">All in all, banks in the euro area now hold much more capital and liquidity than they did prior to the crisis – they have become much more stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">At the same time, European banking supervision ensures that banks across the euro area are supervised according to the same high standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.52,0)">But of course all this cannot stop banks from failing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.21,0)">And nor is it supposed to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.65,0)">In a well-functioning market, companies with a business model that no longer works must exit the market – this is just as true for banks as it is for other companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.45,0)">And banks can fail, as we have seen in recent weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">So we have at least come one step closer to a true market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Alongside labour markets and the banking system, public finances also have an important role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">They too can help to mitigate economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.14,0)">One example is automatic stabilisers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.74,0)">In a downturn, the tax burden goes down – thanks to progression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">At the same time, social spending goes up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The former relieves the burden on the people, the latter supports them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Together, these effects help the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">They help the economy just as growth-enhancing measures by the government do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">All this requires sound public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">That’s why we always call upon the euro area countries to consolidate their public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And that’s why we always emphasise how important the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Their purpose is to keep countries from taking on too much debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Since the crisis, these rules have been strengthened – now it is important to apply them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">To sum up, countries with flexible labour and product markets, stable banks and sound public finances are in a good position; they are resilient, and they are efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.42,0)">But, as I have already said, even such countries can get into difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Not all risks can be eliminated, and not all shocks can be fully absorbed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.98,0)">And when 19 countries share one currency, all are affected if one gets into difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And this brings us to the question of how we should deal with those risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As I have already mentioned, one option is to share risks via the public sector – using taxpayers’ money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This was done during the crisis, and led to heated debates on the architecture of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">While we’re on the subject of the architecture of the euro area, there is indeed scope for improvement here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">For example, a European finance minister with strong powers could help to bring about national fiscal policies that are also in the interest of all European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Such a finance minister should then not just have a coordinating role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.23,0)">He or she should be able to take action if Member States deviate from the agreed path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">The minister could thus serve as an anchor for deeper economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">But irrespective of the things that could be improved in the public sector, we should not forget the private sector when it comes to the question of how we deal with risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Risks can also be shared via the private sector, through the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.38,0)">Then, if a country got into difficulties, it would not be European taxpayers who would bear the risks; it would be those who invested in the country – whether they invested in the state itself or in private companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">To make this work, investors would have to be able to absorb the potential losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And here, there are still a few things we need to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.59,0)">Take banks and public finances, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.79,0)">Governments often rely on domestic banks for funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.47,0)">If the government cannot service its debt, many credit institutions may also end up in crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.28,0)">The market is thus not in a position to bear the losses without getting into difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.21,0)">During the crisis, this led to a situation in which taxpayers had to step in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To resolve this problem, we have to take a look at the rulebook for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Currently, government bonds are treated as risk-free.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.05,0)">Thus, banks do not have to hold capital against them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.41,0)">This might tempt banks to hold too many of their own government’s bonds – given the associated risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.18,0)">But we all know now that government bonds are not risk-free.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">So it is high time that the rules were adjusted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We have to ensure that government bond holdings are backed up with capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.94,0)">The higher the risk and the more bonds of an individual government a bank buys, the more capital it would need to hold against them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Banks would then hold fewer government bonds in total and fewer bonds of any individual government, and they would have bigger buffers to absorb losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">If a country were to get into difficulties, the market would then be able to bear the losses without putting the burden on taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">At the same time, banks would develop an interest in sound public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.85,0)">Public finances that were not sound would be punished by the market – it would demand higher interest rates, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.05,0)">This would then force governments to keep their finances in order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">And we can pursue the logic of this further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">A capital markets union would offer the possibility to share risks – and to do so across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.93,0)">In a truly European capital market, risks could be borne by many shoulders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.02,0)">In this context, I am not only thinking of governments, banks and bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.85,0)">I am also thinking of private companies, savers and shares.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">A truly European capital market would make the monetary union more stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But the main aim of the capital markets union is of course a different one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">First and foremost, the capital markets union would help the economy to grow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Companies would no longer be restricted to domestic banks for funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">They could access sources of equity and loans throughout Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">At the same time, savers would have more options to invest their money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">All in all, it would be possible to fund the economy more efficiently and allow it to grow faster.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">For all these reasons, a European capital markets union is currently being built.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.3,0)">This is not something that can be done in a day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Capital markets are complex and diverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.74,0)">Exchanges, central counterparties, tax law, insolvency law – these and much more play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Creating a European capital market thus requires many different measures to be taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.75,0)">And, more than anything, it requires time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Still, that is no reason not to do it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The capital markets union has been an important project from the beginning, and, since Brexit, it has become even more important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, The first four acts of the euro area’s story have been written.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.56,0)">Now it’s all about the fifth act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">It’s about putting the crisis behind us for good, resolving the conflicts and arriving at a happy ending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In my speech, I have talked a lot about how we can deal with risks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.76,0)">But it’s not just about risks and stability, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It’s also about opportunities; it’s about growth and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Here too, Europe offers the best possible conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">And more and more citizens are beginning to realise that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">According to a recent poll, support for the European Union is on the rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.08,0)">That is a good sign but no reason to relax, because another poll shows that there are still differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.35,0)">According to that poll, the average citizen does not feel that he or she benefits from Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Our goal should therefore be to ensure stability and prosperity for all citizens of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">We have to achieve that goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">It may not be easy, but it is possible, and it will be worthwhile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In my speech, I listed a few of the things we can do to get closer to our goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The important thing now is to make a start and to begin writing the fifth act of the euro area’s story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As the German playwright Friedrich Hebbel said, “Drama should not present new stories, but new situations”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Many thanks for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Stokes, B., Wike, R. and Manevich, D., “Post-Brexit, Europeans More
