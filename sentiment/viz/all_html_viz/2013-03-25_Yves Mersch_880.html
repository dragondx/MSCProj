    <span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)"> Opening of the “New Face of the Euro” exhibition Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Banco de España, Madrid, 25 March 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen, On behalf of the European Central Bank, I would like to warmly welcome you to today’s event and thank you for having accepted our invitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">In particular, I would like to thank Mr Restoy for his kind words.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">I am very pleased that you have offered to host the “New Face of the Euro” exhibition in the Sala Chaflán of the Banco de España.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The exhibition focuses on the new series of euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.74,0)">They will start to appear in May this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Then the new €5 banknote enters into circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The hologram and watermark of this note show a portrait of a woman from the classical world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But it’s not Cybele, who you can see just outside this building.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.26,0)">I realise the madrileños among you could be disappointed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It’s Europa, a figure from Greek mythology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And that’s why the new series is called the Europa series.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But the exhibition covers more than that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">It’s a chance to learn about the money we have all been using for more than a decade now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A whole generation is growing up that has known no other currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">So younger visitors to the exhibition might be curious to see the peseta and the other currencies on display here that perhaps their parents have told them about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">And they will surely enjoy the kids’ corner, which offers a more playful way to learn about the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The banknote denominations – from €5 to €500 – show examples of buildings and bridges in different architectural styles down the ages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">They aim to highlight the common cultural heritage of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">And the new notes with the new element seek to strengthen that sense of belonging and commitment to Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">One of the main tasks of the central banks in the euro area is to ensure the integrity of euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">This means we have to steadily develop the notes to stay ahead of counterfeiters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">So the Europa series has some new and enhanced security features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.02,0)">They will be even more difficult to counterfeit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Over a period of several years, the Europa series will gradually replace the first series of euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">These new notes will be just as easy to recognise and to check.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Our single currency is a key step within the on-going process of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The euro banknotes have become the most visible symbol of that process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">The euro has become moreover a symbol of solidarity in times of crisis, with the euro area assisting countries that have to go through tough but necessary adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">With the support of their European partners the Spanish authorities have been decisive in embarking on a financial adjustment programme that has helped to clean the balance sheets of the weakest banks and recapitalised them with fresh funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">This has laid the foundations for a revival of the flow of credit to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Allow me a personal remark, that I have the greatest respect for the Spanish people who are experiencing hard times but are sticking to their commitments and responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, I sincerely hope that you will enjoy visiting the New Face of the Euro Exhibition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Without further ado, it is a pleasure for me to declare the exhibition open.</span>
