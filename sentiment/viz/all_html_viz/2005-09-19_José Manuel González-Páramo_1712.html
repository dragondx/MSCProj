    <span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)"> Regional divergence in the euro area Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,International Conference on “The Role of Government in Regional Economic Development”, rede  , Universidade de Vigo,Baiona, 19 September 2005 Dear colleagues, First of all I would like to thank the research group in Economics, Energy and the Environment and the University of Vigo for inviting me to Baiona and giving me the opportunity to participate in this stimulating event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The topic of this international conference that I am pleased and honoured to open is “The role of Government in Regional Economic Development”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Under this heading, most of the very interesting papers that will follow my presentation will discuss the design of policies that could help the poorer regions of a country to grow faster and converge towards the richer regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I will deal with this topic from a euro area point of view and take a macro perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.94,0)">In particular, I will concentrate on the issue of economic divergences in our Monetary Union and their policy implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">More concretely, I will endeavour to tackle three fundamental questions: are inflation and growth dynamics systematically different across euro area countries?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.35,0)">What is behind the observed differences in performance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.09,0)">What are the policy challenges related to these divergences?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The issue of how to deal with heterogeneity in a diverse single currency area has been an issue at the heart of the debate in Europe all along the road to deeper economic integration, and indeed well before the single currency was introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">This matter has attracted renewed interest in recent public discussion, in particular after media reports sounded the alarm about increased divergence of growth rates in the euro area in the last quarter of 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In this context, almost seven years since the introduction of the euro provide us with some perspective, albeit surely still an incomplete one, to deal with this topic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The terms of the debate are very familiar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.83,0)">While inflation and growth differentials are a normal phenomenon in any monetary union, their occurrence in the euro area context is combined with institutional and economic characteristics that are, to a large extent, unique, such as a lack of significant centralised fiscal transfer mechanisms and decentralised responsibility for fiscal and other economic policies, together with limited labour mobility and rigidities in labour and product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Against this background, monetary policy in EMU is conducted by the ECB with the primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area as a whole; it does not, therefore, directly address differences in national economic developments that may emerge across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">To deal with this issue, I believe it is important to first address the main facts related to economic differentials in the euro area and then to briefly analyse the factors that may explain those differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I will follow this structure in my presentation today and will then examine the implications for economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.05,0)">The facts: regional divergence in the euro area What are the main facts related to inflation and growth dispersion among euro area countries?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">A first look at the data shows that the dispersion of inflation across the euro area countries has broadly stabilised since the inception of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.23,0)">Looking back to the beginning of the 1990s, the degree of inflation dispersion, measured as the unweighted standard deviation among the 12 euro area countries, was characterised by a strong downward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.88,0)">The high degree of dispersion in the early 1990s – around 6 percentage points – was mainly the result of very high levels of inflation in a few countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.3,0)">Between 1994 and 1998, inflation dispersion declined, and in the second half of 1999 reached its lowest level since the start of the Stage Three of EMU, namely less than 1 percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Since then, with the exception of a modest increase over the period from 2000 to 2002, it has changed very little.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.44,0)">By way of comparison, it is worth noting that since 1999 inflation dispersion across the euro area has been fluctuating around the level observed for the 14 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.87,0)">At the same time, inflation differentials in the euro area appear to be very persistent, in the sense that many countries have systematically maintained either a positive or a negative inflation gap with the euro area average since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.12,0)">This persistence seems to be a feature specific to the euro area, where 7 of the 12 economies have recorded annual inflation rates either consistently above or consistently below the euro area average since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A first insight into the possible causes of inflation differentials can be gained by referring to their accounting components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.88,0)">For this purpose, it is useful to distinguish between internal factors – such as unit labour costs, profit margins and net indirect taxes – and external factors – such as import prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In 9 of the 12 countries, internal factors have been the most important contributors to the inflation differentials in relation to the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.03,0)">Import costs have also played a major role in a few cases  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">As regards the internal sources of inflation differentials, the main contributions have come from unit labour costs and the gross operating surplus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.39,0)">In Germany, France and Finland, in particular, below-average dynamics in both these variables have contributed significantly to the negative inflation differentials in relation to the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The positive gaps for Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain were the result of dynamics above the euro area average in both unit labour costs and profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The diversity of inflation rates among euro area countries also has an important sectoral dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Overall, the degree of dispersion in the upward movement of services prices across the euro area countries has been higher than that observed for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">At the other extreme, the rates of increase in non-energy industrial goods prices converged significantly throughout the 1990s, levelling off at a low degree of dispersion from 1999 onwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Let us turn now to economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.74,0)">A first look at growth dispersion within the euro area, measured by the unweighted standard deviation, suggests that it is not particularly abnormal, as compared with recent and past history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.08,0)">In fact, this growth dispersion has been fluctuating around the low level of 2 percentage points since the 1970s; since 1999 it has even experienced a slight downward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">As in the case of inflation differentials, euro area growth dispersion is not unusually large compared with that in other currency areas, although it shows a certain degree of persistence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Some euro area countries   have been, since the mid-1990s, persistently growing above the euro area average, while others   have been systematically performing below the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.65,0)">From a supply-side perspective, a growth accounting exercise, where overall GDP growth is decomposed into its different components following a standard production function approach  , suggests that total factor productivity has played a prominent role in explaining dispersion among euro area countries over the last 30 years, although its contribution seems to have decreased since the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In parallel, the contribution from capital has displayed an increasing trend while that of labour has shown a decreasing contribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.21,0)">Focusing upon demand components, total investment, exports and imports have shown a downward dispersion trend since the mid-1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.28,0)">If we look at the sectoral breakdown, agriculture and construction feature the highest dispersion, with no defined trends in any sector other than manufacturing, where a clear decline can be seen since the late 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This account of the facts related to economic divergences in the euro area can be further completed with a reference to the basic characteristics of European business cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.21,0)">A first insight into this issue can be obtained from the decomposition of real GDP into its cyclical and trend components, which shows that the current degree of dispersion in overall real GDP growth largely reflects lasting trend growth differences and not cyclical differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In addition, a close look at simple correlation coefficients of year-on-year GDP growth rates indicates that correlations across countries have increased in the last 30 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Moreover, on the basis of the analysis of monthly and quarterly industrial production data, recent research work concludes that synchronisation of European cycles is high and this strong co-movement dates from before the establishment of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.24,0)">From a different perspective, the quarterly chronology of peaks and troughs in GDP across European countries confirms that the euro area countries share relatively similar duration and amplitude of the business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Similarities seem to be the norm rather than the exception, with a complete cycle lasting on average about six to seven years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.65,0)">All in all, the main facts can be summarised in two conclusions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.78,0)">Current inflation and growth differentials among euro area countries are not large when compared with historical trends or observed differences in other currency unions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.12,0)">However, they tend to be persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.1,0)">The causes of regional divergence in the euro area In order to better discuss the origins of inflation and growth differentials, it is useful to make a distinction between three groups of driving factors:   transitory factors related to the convergence process;   factors related to long-lasting or permanent differences in national economic structures; and   policy-induced factors related to the conduct and operation of national fiscal and structural policies or to the various regional responses to euro area-wide policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The convergence process Starting with differentials that were caused by the process of convergence prior to Stage Three of EMU, the one-off convergence of nominal interest rates towards the low rates prevailing in the best-performing countries in terms of credibility was an important temporary factor shaping economic differentials in the first years of the euro area’s existence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The adoption of the euro led to a significant reduction in both nominal and real interest rates and in financial costs in countries that had experienced higher inflation rates in the past, as well as a higher degree of integration with the financial markets of the rest of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This contributed to a surge in domestic demand in those countries, exerting sustained upward pressure on prices, particularly in the non-tradable goods and services sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">A second important factor was the implementation of the Single Market programme in the first half of the 1990s and the subsequent introduction of the euro in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.06,0)">Both added to a marked decline in price level dispersion, mainly for tradable goods, which has also contributed to generating some of the inflation differentials observed in the first years of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Looking ahead, the importance of this type of price level convergence for euro area inflation differentials should diminish over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">While market integration and increased cross-border price transparency has led to convergence in the price of traded goods, a large proportion of consumer price inflation is accounted for by prices of goods and services that are not traded between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.4,0)">In this respect, the Balassa-Samuelson effect has often been discussed in relation to persistent inflation differentials in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.26,0)">At the centre of the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis are differences in productivity growth between countries’ tradable and non-tradable goods sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.56,0)">In essence, this theory states that countries with large differences between their labour productivity growth rates in these two sectors – due, for instance, to a process of catching-up in income levels – will also tend to experience higher overall inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.57,0)">The Balassa-Samuelson effect reflects an equilibrium phenomenon: since international competition puts downward pressure on prices in the tradable goods sector, upward price pressures arise only in the non-tradable sector and the resulting inflation differentials across countries do not need to be reabsorbed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.48,0)">Opinions differ as to the extent to which the Balassa-Samuelson hypothesis is relevant to the euro area, partly because it is difficult to quantify the effect with any precision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.23,0)">Overall, there is a growing consensus that this theory constitutes only a partial explanation for the persistent inflation differentials observed in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Moreover, the size of the Balassa-Samuelson effect for countries currently in the euro area is likely to diminish over time, provided that convergence in terms of GDP per capita among those countries proceeds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Finally, as regards the role of a catching-up effect in explaining observed growth differentials in the euro area, it is equally worth noting that gaps between euro area countries in terms of real per capita GDP seem very persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">There are no clear indications of a tendency for countries to converge toward a common level of income, with the notable exception of Ireland and to a lesser extent Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">To sum up, current and past differential developments in the euro area economies can be only partly explained in terms of a process of transitory convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">We should then look to the role played by other factors, more structural or more institutional in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Structural differences The facts presented thus far indeed appear to lend support to the argument that differences in economic developments between euro area countries stem to a significant extent from structural factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I will concentrate on two of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.29,0)">One first element that may have contributed to lasting inflation and output differentials in the single currency area relates to member countries’ differing exposure to changes in the determinants of the external trade and in prices of raw materials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.93,0)">Fluctuations in these factors coupled with differences between economies in the degree of openness, in the composition of international trade and in trade links with non-euro area partner countries might be relevant factors behind inflation and growth differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.94,0)">A second important structural factor relates to rigidities in wage and price-setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The process of adaptation to changing economic conditions typically requires the continuous adjustment of relative prices across regions and sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Such a mechanism, which is a normal and desirable feature of a market-based economy, may give rise to short-lived inflation differentials across the regions and sectors of a monetary union in the face of demand and supply shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.2,0)">However, the presence of rigidities affecting the price and wage formation mechanism delays the necessary adjustment and gives rise to distortions in relative prices after such shocks, thereby contributing to lasting inflation and growth differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Recent provisional evidence gathered by the Eurosystem Inflation Persistence Network – a research network studying the patterns, determinants and implications of inflation persistence in the euro area and its member countries – helps to shed some light on the importance of rigidities in the price-setting behaviour of firms in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.09,0)">For instance, the Network calculates that average consumer price duration – the time elapsing between two successive price changes – in the euro area is between four and five quarters, compared with an estimate of around two quarters for the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">This seems to indicate that, on average, there is greater rigidity in price-setting in the euro area than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.23,0)">Looking at the sectoral pattern, energy and unprocessed food prices seem to change most frequently, while services prices appear to be modified less frequently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.01,0)">If prices for services are indeed characterised by a systematically longer adjustment process, this could, given the large weight of this sector in the euro area economy, generate significant and persistent inflation divergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">This conclusion would seem to sit well with the evidence I cited earlier that the services sector   contributes significantly to overall inflation dispersion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">It is also supported by the evidence on the importance of unit labour costs in explaining differentials in changes in GDP deflators across the euro area, given that a large share of the total output of the services sector is accounted for by employment compensation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.02,0)">Overall, this suggests that a substantial part of the persistent divergence of price developments may stem from differences in wage developments and in wage-setting mechanisms across euro area countries, including – in some cases – the automatic indexation of nominal wages to prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The role of policies Finally, both euro area-wide and regional policies may have played a role in shaping the degree of heterogeneity in the currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.63,0)">Fiscal policies in particular could be one of the sources of output differentials in the euro area insofar the use of fiscal instruments had been inappropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">In this respect, there is some evidence that the pro-cyclical effects of the fiscal policies of euro area countries may have helped to increase cyclical differences in the recent past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.38,0)">Furthermore, recent evidence exists that large fiscal deficits tend to reduce business cycle synchronisation by creating idiosyncratic fiscal shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.38,0)">One such shock, which is the recourse to increases in indirect taxes and administrative prices, also has a particular bearing on the issue of inflation differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In effect, changes in administered prices, which account for around 6% of the HICP, and indirect taxes can generate inflation dispersion, at least in the short to medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In principle, monetary policy could also add to growth and inflation dispersion in a currency union via its differentiated transmission across countries, particularly in the presence of differing degrees of nominal rigidities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In this respect, however, there is no conclusive evidence of systematic differences in the transmission of monetary policy impulses across regions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.22,0)">The effects of monetary policy depend critically on the monetary policy regime in place, and the change in policy regime due to the introduction of the euro may have modified the transmission mechanism of monetary policy in the euro area, making it more difficult to properly and reliably extrapolate from historical experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.48,0)">Furthermore, in the public and political domains it has often been argued that the combination of uniform interest rates and inflation differentials imply different “real” interest rates across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.3,0)">It is maintained that such a difference might have a destabilising impact on national economies because, for example, countries with above-average inflation would experience lower real interest rates, which would in turn fuel domestic demand and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.43,0)">And countries with below-average inflation would suffer from higher real interest rates, resulting in further downward pressure on domestic demand and inflation and thereby adding to the original inflation and growth differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.36,0)">In my opinion, these views are to a large extent misleading since they neglect relevant economic considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.3,0)">First of all, the aforementioned argument is generally made with reference to ex post measures of the real interest rate, calculated by subtracting the currently observed level of inflation from nominal interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.46,0)">However, what matters for investment and consumption decisions are ex ante measures of real interest rates, namely the difference between market interest rates and economic agents’ expectations with regard to inflation developments over the relevant horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.0,0)">The dispersion across countries of ex ante measures of real interest rates is significantly lower than that of ex post measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.27,0)">In the case of long-term interest rates, it has been approximately half that of real interest rates measured using realised inflation since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.02,0)">Furthermore, again since 1999, the dispersion of ex ante measures of real interest rates has been about one-third of that prevailing before the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.35,0)">Second, and perhaps even more fundamentally, our assessment of the consequences of different real interest rates should obviously depend on the underlying causes, which could be manifold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">For example, if a country’s lower-than-average inflation rate is due to higher-than-average productivity growth, this would be an indication that the country in question has strong investment prospects, even if its real interest rate is higher than that of other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Finally, in a monetary union, where exchange rates among countries are by definition fixed, there are strong market-based forces that work in a stabilising manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In particular, if a country has below-average inflation on account of weak demand, it will gain a competitive edge in relation to other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Over time this tends to increase demand in that country  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">As shown in a number of recent studies, the competitiveness   channel, although slow to develop, eventually becomes the dominant adjustment factor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">It must be noted that, as a consequence of the prolonged inflation differentials observed over recent years, the euro area countries have experienced marked differences the evolution of the indicator of national competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.14,0)">At the same time, we need to be aware of the fact that this re-equilibrating mechanism could be effective only after an extended period in the euro area, and some of the persistent divergences observed may indeed be harmful if not timely addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The implications of regional divergence for the design of economic policies What can policy-makers do to tackle regional divergences?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.09,0)">Should we worry about regional heterogeneity in the first place?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Shocks, smoothing and policies A proper answer to the first question, in terms of the potential role for structural and fiscal policies and for monetary policy, requires that prior consideration be given to the size and nature of regional differences and to their effect on consumption and welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Several arguments could be put forward in support of taking a sanguine view on this matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.61,0)">Inflation differentials are not unusually large at present and may be partly attributed to transitory phenomena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.29,0)">Growth rate dispersion and output gap differentials are not higher than historically, nor are they abnormally different to those in the United States or other federal countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Further, although output per capita differentials have been very persistent over the last 30 years, the amount of risk sharing   has increased dramatically since the early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This implies that EMU is probably working and asymmetries in output should be less of a concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.51,0)">A more balanced view, however, would be that these arguments are true but do not tell the whole story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.52,0)">Dispersion in the euro area is larger than that observed across regions of certain individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.34,0)">In addition, as illustrated by the decline in competitiveness in recent years, the exchange rate channel seems to be operating in a very sluggish fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">An additional, related consideration centres on the nature of the shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.63,0)">The economic asymmetries observed among countries in a monetary union can be the result of either common shocks that propagate differently across countries or idiosyncratic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">This distinction is not only theoretically appealing but also crucial in terms of its policy implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.86,0)">If variations in economic activity between countries with different institutions, economic structures or economic policies are driven by a common cause, national or regional policies designed to counteract the variations may be ineffective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">If, on the other hand, asymmetries are the result of idiosyncratic shocks, then national policies aimed at influencing economic activity would have a role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This question is of particular interest in the euro area, where the use of a common monetary policy in response to idiosyncratic shocks is not feasible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Different attempts can be found in the literature to provide a solution to this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The results of recent papers that apply a VAR methodology allow us to conclude that country-specific shocks, more than euro area-wide or global shocks, are responsible for the output gaps in the euro area countries and may have a long-lasting effect, thus helping to generate persistent differences across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Structural and fiscal policies Thus national policies would appear to enhance the ability of countries to address shocks and divergences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Starting with structural policies, it is widely recognised that two factors are crucial to the smooth adjustment to changing economic conditions and the efficient functioning of the labour and product markets in a single currency area: first, the mobility of factors of production and, second, the flexibility of wage and price-setting behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.36,0)">On the mobility of factors of production, a clear dichotomy can be observed in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">On the one hand, the process of integrating capital and financial markets has already come a long way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">A continuous increase in cross-border financial and capital flows is being observed, as well as increasing competition in the provision of financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Further action is needed, though, to remove the remaining market segmentation and regulatory impediments to free competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">If we take the deep, liquid and unified US financial markets as a benchmark, it is patent that the euro area still has some way to go, especially as regards the integration of equity markets, the establishment of common legal and regulatory frameworks, and the consolidation of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Further integration of the European financial markets would help to reduce the volatility of consumption by increasing opportunities for risk sharing and consumption smoothing, and would also promote a more homogeneous transmission mechanism of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.72,0)">On the other hand, labour appears either to be too slow to react to wage and demand conditions or is prevented from doing so by persistently distorted price signals, leading to relatively low labour mobility between countries and regions, as well as between sectors and professions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This points to a need for more flexible labour markets in the euro area, particularly at the national and regional levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.97,0)">While some discernible progress with regard to labour market reform has been seen in almost all countries of the euro area over the past decade, labour markets still appear to be too rigid and unresponsive to economic conditions – as indicated by the persistently high level of structural unemployment and the low labour force participation rates observed in most countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">As regards the need to promote flexibility in wage and price-setting, it is crucial to continue the process of strengthening effective competition, for instance through liberalisation and deregulation, in order to improve the efficiency of price signals in the goods and services markets, and thereby enhance the efficiency of resource allocation in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Turning to fiscal policies, it is clear that proper fiscal reforms can also help to enhance the ability of individual countries to respond to economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">In particular, sound government finances are crucial to allowing a country to let automatic stabilisers work fully without running the risk of excessively high deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">This represents an important mechanism in the process of macroeconomic adjustment in response to regional divergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Historical experience shows that discretionary fiscal policies are – especially in view of the implementation and impact lags involved – a blunt and imprecise instrument when it comes to responding to cyclical fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.62,0)">It is thus particularly important that governments prevent discretionary policy measures from acting pro-cyclically over the business cycle, thereby exacerbating divergences across countries in the wake of asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">All in all, structural and fiscal policies that are aimed at fostering greater mobility of production factors, in particular labour, and more flexibility in price and wage-setting can increase the effectiveness of those re-equilibrating mechanisms that sometimes appear too slow to operate in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Monetary policy Moving to the side of monetary policy, I must recall that the establishment of the euro area spurred a far-ranging academic, but also political, debate on the proper design and conduct of monetary policy in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.72,0)">More recently, these discussions have also tended to focus upon the implications of inflation differentials for the formulation of monetary policy in a single currency area, particularly where such differentials are coupled with, or are the product of, nominal and real structural rigidities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">From this ongoing debate some important general conclusions can be drawn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">First, there is a broad consensus among academics, observers and policy-makers that monetary policy should focus on maintaining price stability in the single currency area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">It should thus anchor inflation expectations and contribute to increasing market transparency, thereby facilitating the necessary adjustment of relative prices across different countries or sectors in the presence of economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.99,0)">By contrast, it is widely recognised that assigning to monetary policy the additional role of directly addressing the balance between the sectors or regions of the single currency area in the process of adjustment to shocks would overburden monetary policy to the detriment of its primary role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.15,0)">This is particularly the case when, as discussed previously, asymmetries are mainly caused by idiosyncratic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In that case, national economic policies are better instruments to enhance the ability of individual countries to respond to economic shocks and regional divergences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Second, the very design of monetary policy can cater for regional or national diversity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In fact, the presence of long-term equilibrium inflation differentials across countries constitutes one of the central justifications for a central bank aiming to maintain the inflation rate in the currency area as a whole at a very low level, although not too close to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Third, it is important for the central bank to take into account regional and sectoral information on the source and nature of economic shocks, which includes monitoring and understanding the underlying reasons for inflation differentials, even if policy is formulated with a view to maintaining price stability for the currency area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Finally, by maintaining a medium-term orientation in the conduct of its monetary policy, a central bank can facilitate the necessary adjustment of relative prices across regions and sectors in the presence of asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me say that those principles are indeed present in the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">First, as laid down in the Treaty establishing the European Community, the primary objective of the Eurosystem is to maintain price stability for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">By keeping price levels stable, monetary policy contributes to the adjustment of relative prices and facilitates their role in guiding the allocation of resources across the sectors and countries of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">This is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to economic welfare and the attainment of high levels of economic activity and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">In May 2003 – as part of its review of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy – the Governing Council of the ECB clarified its price stability objective, explaining that, in pursuing price stability, it aims to maintain inflation rates “below but close to 2%” over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">By specifying that it aims to keep the inflation rate close to the upper bound of its definition of price stability, the Governing Council made it clear that this also takes into account the implications of inflation differentials across the countries of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">In particular, it provides an adequate safety margin to prevent some regions from structurally operating at negative inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.17,0)">It was thus recognised that inflation differentials could pose a risk for regions with structurally lower inflation rates in terms of the potential costs of adjustment associated with the possible presence of downward nominal rigidities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Second, while the ECB’s internal work, analysis and assessment of economic information, its policy deliberations and its decisions are fully aligned with the goal of maintaining price stability for the euro area as a whole, this does not mean that the ECB looks exclusively at euro area-wide information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In order to achieve its objective and, in particular, to conduct its broad-based analysis of the risks to price stability over the medium term, the ECB regularly reviews and analyses all relevant information relating to the various sectors and countries of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Thus, we closely monitor sectoral and national developments in order to better formulate our assessment of the economic situation and its likely evolution for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Indeed, it is essential that the monetary policy-maker is able to understand the source and nature of economic shocks – whether demand or supply-related, whether permanent or temporary – and to assess their effects on the economy as a whole in order to formulate the best possible monetary policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In this respect, the analysis of disaggregated information is crucial, as many shocks of euro area-wide relevance originate in specific countries or sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Finally, a key element of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy is its medium-term orientation, which implies that it does not attempt to maintain or restore price stability in the very short term in the wake of economic changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">This allows the ECB to formulate the best possible monetary policy taking due account of the nature of economic shocks and, at the same time, to provide flexibility for individual economies or sectors to adjust gradually after localised or asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.65,0)">Final remarks Dear colleagues, It is time for me to conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">I have today stressed a factual point: growth and inflation differentials among euro countries are far from being large, whether from a historical perspective or compared with other monetary unions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">They appear to be, however, relatively persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.91,0)">While differences across countries can be seen as a normal feature in any monetary union, lasting economic differentials that are the product of misaligned national policies and/or deep-seated structural inefficiencies may be damaging for the national economies and need to be addressed by national policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">In particular, it is crucial that countries pursue suitable structural policies aimed at enhancing their flexibility and adaptability to continuously changing conditions in the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">On the monetary policy front, by anchoring inflation expectations and increasing transparency, the ECB’s monetary policy is contributing to the adjustment of relative prices, thereby facilitating their role in guiding the allocation of resources across countries and sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">As an indication of the success of this strategy, I draw your attention to the fact that inflation expectations at the level of the individual countries are more closely aligned than observed inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Given the importance of expectations for future developments in wage and price-setting behaviour, this implies that a powerful mechanism has been put in place to help keep economic developments across the individual countries of the euro area closely bound together.</span>
