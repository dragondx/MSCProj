    <span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)"> Advancing financial market integration Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Government Borrowers Forum organised by the World Bank, Luxembourg, 18 May 2017 To foster European financial integration, the ECB has set sail under the European flag.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">And we will continue our journey towards European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Today, in this respect, I’d like to make three key points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">We need to better explore the potential of our integrated financial market infrastructure for securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">T2S has integrated the securities settlement business, bringing the economies of scale it needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Therefore we welcome the announcement of the international central securities depositories   to bring Eurobonds   to T2S for settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.61,0)">In the EU, issuance has remained a largely domestic business, often as a result of legacy structures and national rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">In a true single market, one could expect a Europe-wide primary market for securities to develop in order to ensure equal and unrestricted access for economic actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">We stand ready to examine the need for and potential of such a European issuance service together with potential users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">On central counterparty   clearing, we must consider whether recent geopolitical events require the Eurosystem to take action to ensure that we continue to adequately control the impact of offshore clearing activities on the stability of our common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Single market for capital To foster the smooth and effective transmission of monetary policy, an efficient and integrated financial system is key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Financial integration is essential for an effective monetary union and relevant to financial stability, to which we contribute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The Eurosystem’s task of promoting well-functioning payment systems, as part of its monetary policy mandate, is also supported by financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.17,0)">And it is not something we can take for granted: incomplete financial integration creates vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">This is why, in the past few years, fundamental steps towards an integrated and developed capital market have been taken at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The banking union and the capital markets union are important initiatives which have the potential to change the structure of the euro area’s financial architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">A single market for capital is needed primarily because it can improve the efficiency of credit allocation, it can enhance risk-sharing and it can foster diverse sources of financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Indeed, it would strengthen the economic resilience of Economic and Monetary Union as a whole by providing the ECB with alternative channels for transmitting monetary policy and by enabling capital markets to play a role in cushioning asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">However, to facilitate the mobility and free flow of capital and financial assets across Europe, it is essential that an efficient underlying infrastructure is in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">A lot has been achieved already, but still we need to ensure that we use the market infrastructure as effectively as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">TARGET2-Securities Nine years ago this month  , the Governing Council issued a proposal to all European central securities depositories   to join T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The project was backed by the European Parliament, but the ECOFIN Council specified three requirements:   the platform should be multicurrency;   participation in T2S should not be compulsory; and   access to central bank money should not be restricted for non-participating CSDs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Nine years on and the first roll-out phase of T2S is almost complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The system is multicurrency and the Danish krone is set to join in October 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The majority of European markets will be connected, although participation remains voluntary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">And some CSDs outside the European Union have even expressed an interest in joining T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This February, the successful migration of six CSDs from Austria, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg, Slovakia and Slovenia doubled the settlement volume in T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.26,0)">Today, a daily average of around 500,000 transactions is settled on the platform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This represents 90% of the transaction volume that is expected to be settled on the platform after the end of the full migration in September 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The volume is in line with the expected yearly forecast done by the Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The most recent survey from March 2017 shows that the overall volume growth for the next two years is anticipated to be 5.3% on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Additionally, when the Danish krone joins next year we expect the volume to increase by 5.5 million transactions per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">With the introduction of T2S, the average cost at market infrastructure level per transaction has decreased significantly – in particular for cross-CSD transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Our initial cost estimations showed that the average fee per domestic CSD settlement in the euro area was 73 euro cent while cross-border transactions were up to ten times more expensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.93,0)">The launch of T2S has brought the transaction fee per instruction down to 15 euro cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">However, T2S is built on a full-cost recovery principle and we continue to monitor the cost recovery prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Consequently, in the first half of 2016 a review of the T2S operating costs was launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Despite the positive market trend, we cannot rule out that the price list will need to be adjusted after 2019 and/or the cost recovery period extended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">T2S also created the momentum for an extraordinary harmonisation agenda which, for many markets, has been the key benefit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">T2S, together with the adoption of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation  , provided the push needed to drive the harmonisation process forwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The market used the project to create a single rulebook and harmonise the post-trade rules and practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The adoption of the ISO 20022 messaging standard, the single schedule for the settlement day, a harmonised settlement cycle of T+2 and a single intraday delivery-versus-payment settlement model in central bank money are but a few examples of the achieved harmonisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But T2S has also contributed to issues that go beyond the core T2S settlement functionalities, such as the harmonisation of the processing of corporate actions and the harmonisation of the different settlement finality rules in T2S CSDs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The large market players which have migrated to T2S have given us very positive feedback.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">T2S has not only harmonised the settlement of securities across Europe and brought forward post-trade harmonisation in at least nine out of the 15 Giovannini barriers, it has also optimised their liquidity and collateral management, which many regard as being the greatest benefit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">We can conclude that the benefits brought by T2S are widely recognised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Eurobonds The single securities settlement platform has also led to greater freedom in the mobility of securities, in particular for the purpose of collateralisation: this is true for all securities used in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.98,0)">An example of that is “Eurobonds”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Since the T2S launch, both Clearstream Group and Euroclear Group have publicly announced that their group   will give their customers the possibility to settle all securities on the T2S platform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">For market participants such as central banks, this is a key benefit, providing greater collateral mobility and greater liquidity efficiency  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In Europe the ICSDs are the main issuers of so-called Eurobonds or international securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Today, over 250,000 outstanding ISINs   are issued through the two ICSDs, with a value of roughly €9.2 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">From a European capital market perspective, these assets are important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">They account for about 25% of all outstanding marketable assets eligible as collateral with the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">I would like to see the announced strategy of the two groups to bring Eurobonds to be settled in T2S starting to take effect by 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.73,0)">Issuance As we see T2S roll out, it has become apparent that despite the progress towards a more integrated market, issuance has remained a largely national business across the EU, often as a result of legacy structures and national rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Indeed, the issue was first identified in the T2S harmonisation agenda in 2011 and remains relevant today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Recently adopted legislation, namely the CSDR level II, addresses certain aspects of the location of issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In particular, it covers the rights of issuers, allowing them to have their securities recorded in the CSD of their choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.98,0)">However, despite both T2S and the CSDR, fragmentation endures and a domestic issuance process at European level does not exist at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.28,0)">There are several possible reasons why the market has failed to generate a more integrated and efficient securities issuance industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.3,0)">These include legal constraints and, specifically, uncertainties arising from issuing in foreign jurisdictions, where some or all aspects of the issuer’s domestic law no longer apply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.87,0)">In addition, regulatory restrictions or domestic market practices may prevent issuers from reaching out to the whole EU investor base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.58,0)">Take, for example, restrictions on the location of primary dealers in sovereign debt or national registration procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The result is that – regardless of the launch of a single securities settlement engine   and the single legal framework   – the market has remained national, from the perspective of securities issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.73,0)">Debt instruments, even supranational ones, are issued nationally and issuers and investors often fail to reach each other across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Although ICSDs issue Eurobonds in a global environment, they remain in the context of specific market infrastructures  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.7,0)">This status quo restricts the investor base, in particular the pan-European one, lowers the level of credit allocation and risk-sharing, and hampers cross-border investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">In a true single market, a Europe-wide market for securities should exist to ensure equal and unrestricted access for economic actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">In this context, the establishment of a European issuance service, which would allow the emergence of a Europe-wide market, would be the next logical step to consider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Central clearing Central clearing is another area in which we should continue our efforts to promote European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Awareness has grown within the European Union of the critical importance of “where” and “how” these clearing houses operate and, as a result, these infrastructures have been under intense scrutiny recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Central clearing is a global financial activity, and major currencies such as the euro, US dollar and Japanese yen are traded and cleared worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">It is undoubtedly an important function within the global financial system, and ensures that investors can hedge their risks by accessing liquidity in multiple currencies across a variety of markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The euro is unique among major currencies, however, in that a significant number of systemically important classes of derivatives and securities are cleared to a large extent outside its currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.86,0)">Looking at the centrally cleared euro-denominated derivatives market, the picture that emerges from the data reported by euro area banks under EMIR is that CCPs established in the UK clear approximately: 95% of their interest rate derivatives transactions; 60% of their credit derivatives transactions; 30% of their commodity derivatives transactions; 25% of their equity derivatives transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Overall, in terms of notional amounts, more than 90% of the euro-denominated derivatives business of euro area banks is cleared via UK CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The importance of UK CCPs is not limited to derivatives, as they are involved in approximately 50% of the cleared euro-denominated repo business of euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">As I have said in the past, the risks stemming from this situation are currently adequately covered: the European Market Infrastructure Regulation allows the Eurosystem to assess and monitor risks through active participation in cross-border supervisory colleges, whose role and prerogatives are guaranteed by the authority of the European Court of Justice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">This framework is complemented by the dedicated Memorandum of Understanding signed by the Bank of England and the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.13,0)">The UK’s recent decision to leave the EU has called into question the ability of authorities such as the Eurosystem to ensure they can continue to adequately control the impact of offshore clearing activities while maintaining the stability of their currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The challenges arising from Brexit are still ahead of us, and authorities need to think carefully about how they can guarantee the stability of their respective currencies in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">For example, in the coming years, a better balance may have to be found between the global nature of central clearing and the need for certain systemically important clearing activities to be under the oversight of the domestic currency areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Naturally, the transition towards a new European and global clearing landscape could raise certain operational challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.43,0)">If poorly managed, it could increase the cost of central clearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">A clear timetable, good cooperation between regulators and careful preparation by market participants would be necessary to ensure a smooth transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">I believe that it is feasible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The European Commission will shortly be making legislative proposals to address systemic risk related to CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Naturally, we are willing to cooperate with the Commission within our areas of expertise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Conclusion In concluding, I want to reiterate the need to reflect on whether recent geopolitical events require the Eurosystem to take action to ensure that we continue to adequately control the impact of offshore clearing activities on the stability of our currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">To deepen integration and complete the Single Market, ambitious goals need to be supported by specific proposals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">We stand ready to facilitate a dialogue and take action on these specific proposals.</span>
