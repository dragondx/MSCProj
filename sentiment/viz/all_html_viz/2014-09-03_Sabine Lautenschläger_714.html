    <span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)"> Countdown to November: European supervision ready for lift-off Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Handelsblatt Konferenz “Banken im Umbruch”,Frankfurt am Main, 3 September 2014 *** Summary European banking supervision will draw on the long-standing experience of 18 – soon 19 – Member States and incorporate it into a new European supervisory culture, said Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank   in a speech at the “Banken im Umbruch” conference in Frankfurt am Main.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">A significant advantage of the new Single Supervisory Mechanism   is the possibility to make cross-country comparisons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">“I am not just thinking of the assessment of specific portfolios here, but also of the early identification of risks, which only become visible, or are at least easier to identify, in horizontal analysis”, she said.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The asset quality review has already given us a deeper insight into the banks’ procedures, thereby making it possible for us to check “which differences between banks are justified and to ascertain where we need to probe critically”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Ms Lautenschläger stressed that, although decision-making in the new European banking supervision will be organised centrally, the SSM can build on regional knowledge and experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">“As national supervisory authorities participate in the supervisory process, the ECB remains close to regional market and banking structures”, she said.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Also in terms of staffing, the SSM will bring together people from different supervisory cultures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The heads of Joint Supervisory Teams will come from a country other than that in which the institution it is supervising is established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">“In concrete terms: the head supervisor for Deutsche Bank will be a French lady; BNP Paribas will be supervised by an Italian man.” *** Ladies and gentlemen, In precisely two months’ time, we will usher in a new era in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">With the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism   on 4 November 2014, the European Central Bank   will assume key competencies in the field of banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">However, unlike the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins in 2002, this step towards further integration will not entail a major symbolic change that is tangible for all citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Nevertheless, the start of the SSM means progress, not only in European integration, but also in day-to-day supervisory work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The ECB – one of the world’s largest supervisors The ECB will take on the direct supervision of around 120 credit institutions and more than 80% of the aggregated balance sheet for the euro area banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In absolute figures, this means a total of more than €21 trillion as per 30 June 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In addition, the ECB will be indirectly supervising the less significant institutions, of which there are just over 3,500.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Here, we will shape supervision by setting binding supervisory standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">This will make the ECB one of the world’s largest supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">I anticipate that, over the next few years, the geographical area under our remit will expand and that the number of directly and indirectly supervised banks will continue to grow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">On the one hand, further countries will join the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">On the other hand, the regime of “close cooperation” gives EU Member States who do not yet have the euro as their currency a chance to participate in the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">When this option was introduced into the SSM Regulation, sceptics thought it unlikely that a Member State would exchange its exclusive supervisory competences for membership of the supervisory mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Developments over the last few months have shown, however, that the ECB has significantly more to offer than just a seat on the Supervisory Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The ECB enjoys trust and credibility – valuable assets for both monetary policy and banking supervision alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Credibility, however, has to be earned anew each day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In this respect, the ECB’s monetary policy can already look back on a solid track record.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In the area of banking supervision, we stand at the very beginning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But that does not mean that we will only start to find our way on 4 November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">For many months now, my colleagues and I have been working to determine, among other things, the focus of our supervisory approach, both conceptually and thematically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The critical issues are: how can the ECB reap the intrinsic benefits of supervising 19 national banking systems?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And how can we ensure that institution-specific insights of the national supervisors are best maintained and incorporated?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Allow me to give you a few examples to explain the conclusions we have reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I will focus on the specific features of the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">So do not be surprised if I do not mention things that are self-evident, such as a preventative, forward-looking and risk-oriented supervisory approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">18 perspectives – one best practice Let us start with 18 perspectives and what is deemed best practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">In developing the SSM’s supervisory culture, we are in a unique starting position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Following the financial market crisis, many countries adjusted their supervisory structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The reforms generally focused on addressing country-specific experiences of the crisis and on international recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We are in a similar situation in setting up the SSM – but with one major difference: we are not just looking at the experiences of one country; we are incorporating the perspectives of 18 – soon 19 – Member States into a common European supervisory culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">For me personally, this is one of the most exciting aspects of creating the supervisory mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.45,0)">An example of this is the weekly meeting of SSM management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Every Friday, Danièle Nouy and I meet with the heads of the four SSM business areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Around the table we therefore have representatives of the French, German, Finnish, Spanish and even US supervisory traditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Another colleague brings to the table many years of experience at a systemically relevant bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">That is of course just one example, among many, of how we are drawing on the various approaches to establish what is “best practice” as the basis for our supervisory activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This process will not be completed by 4 November, but will rather be further refined over the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Horizontal analyses and a level playing field Another considerable advantage of European banking supervision will be the possibility to draw comparisons across European countries and to establish a level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The banking sectors of many European countries are dominated by a few large banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.07,0)">The national supervisory bodies were therefore faced with the problem of having to assess circumstances on the basis of just one bank, or on that of a very small group of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I am not just thinking of the assessment of specific portfolios here, but also of the early identification of risks, which only become visible, or are at least easier to identify, in horizontal analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Although international working groups and the European Banking Authority   have addressed this problem, it is only with the establishment of the SSM that a quantum leap forward can be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The SSM is able to draw on detailed supervisory information from across the euro area and prepare comparative analyses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.51,0)">And I am using the present tense here on purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">With the ongoing comprehensive assessment, we are already active at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">With great efforts on the part of the authorities and banks involved, we have submitted the assessment of the bank portfolios to a unified assessment scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">The asset quality review has given us a deeper insight into the banks’ procedures, thereby making it possible for us to check which differences between banks are justified and to ascertain where we need to probe critically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We will use the knowledge that we have obtained through the peer group review for other supervisory activities as of 4 November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Thus far, these processes have been carried out at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">We are now going to harmonise them throughout the euro area, thereby making it easier to compare the respective risk situations of banks, thus enabling us to target our supervisory activities better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.08,0)">Federal structure – central decision-making Critical voices have warned us in the past about losing sight of the diversity of the European banking sector and wanting to typify a “European” bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.71,0)">I admit that, in the process of harmonising and centralising decision-making powers, there is always also a danger of seeing everything at par.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.42,0)">The ECB is, however, protected from such developments by institutional barriers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">As national supervisory authorities participate in the supervisory process, the ECB remains close to regional market and banking structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Moreover, the ECB’s staff will take a keen look at the business models and risk profiles of each directly supervised bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The kick-off meetings, which have been taking place since early summer between the current supervisors, the ECB and the banks, are simply a first step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.96,0)">In this connection, allow me to stress the inherent dangers in supervision not only of being too far removed, but also of being too close.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Other viewpoints and new supervisory approaches and methods may sharpen our perception and mitigate the danger of accepting a bank’s unjustified customs merely because they have long been familiar to us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">The comparisons and analyses I referred to earlier will also help to counter this danger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.92,0)">But that is not all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We will also address this issue in terms of our staffing policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.35,0)">The head of a Joint Supervisory Team   must come from a different country to the country in which the institution it is supervising is established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In concrete terms: the head supervisor for Deutsche Bank will be a French lady; BNP Paribas will be supervised by an Italian man.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.01,0)">In addition, there will a rotation of staff members among the JSTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">All in all, this will not only enable us to reach more objective judgements about a bank, but will also foster the development of a common supervisory culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">Banking supervision in a central bank Allow me to say a few words about banking supervision in a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Housing the SSM within the ECB will enable us to benefit from synergy effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Exchanges with colleagues from market operations, payment systems and economic analysis will help the supervisors to develop a different viewpoint on current market developments, the importance of a specific institution for payments and the economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">One area in which cooperation will be particularly intensive is macro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Our aim here is to bring together insights from both the macro-prudential and the micro-prudential areas, and to address undesirable developments in a targeted way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, the European supervisory landscape is facing a major change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">With the SSM, we have created a strong, new supervisor at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">The SSM will be able, and have the responsibility, not to do everything differently, but to do some things better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.57,0)">With the conclusion of the comprehensive assessment, and the publication of the results in the second half of October, and the start of our supervisory activity on 4 November, we have a few stressful months ahead of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But we must also remember to occasionally pause for a moment and to reflect beyond the immediate tasks at hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The SSM may have been created as a consequence of, and as a solution to, certain problems in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">But it is destined to be able to achieve much more and – at least that is my hope – to have an effect over and beyond Europe.</span>
