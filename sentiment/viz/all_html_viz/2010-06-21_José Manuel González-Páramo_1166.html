    <span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)"> Reform of the architecture of the financial system Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBBilbao, 21 June 2010 Ladies and Gentlemen, I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Introduction   It is a pleasure to be in the city of Bilbao, which hosts one of the finest modern art museums in Spain and Europe: the Guggenheim museum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">With its very distinct architecture, this museum is the city’s world-famous hallmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Much as I love the design of the building, however, I will talk today about another type of architecture, namely that of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And just like the Guggenheim building, the current reforms of the financial system stir a lot of emotions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We are dealing here with a very broad topic but I will approach it like a tourist visiting the Guggenheim museum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I will start by giving you a broad overview, describing the landscape as it were.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will briefly review the causes of the financial crisis and will run through the main initiatives that are on the plate of policy makers to prevent a crisis of such magnitude and severity ever recurring again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Then I will turn to four eye-catching initiatives: first, the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board or ESRB, a new body that will for the first time become responsible for macro-prudential supervision in the EU; second, how policy makers are dealing with systemically important institutions; third, the issue of procyclicality or the dynamic interplay between the financial sector and the real economy; fourth and last topic to which I will pay some more attention is the mandate of central banks in the area of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Let us now embark on our architectural walk!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.74,0)">Causes of the current crisis Much has been said about the root causes of the current crisis over the past three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I will not expand on this topic but I will just mention specific factors – some of them of a macro- and others of a micro-economic nature – which in my view were key in the run up to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">In the two or three years before the crisis erupted, a constellation of factors, including very favourable macro-financial conditions combined with strong growth, low inflation, ample liquidity, exceptionally low volatility across virtually all financial markets and extraordinarily low risk premia, had the effect of covering up the building up of significant imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.02,0)">Significant financial imbalances were in the making, at various levels of the global economy and financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Among these were exuberant real estate prices, and a flourishing securitisation business, which facilitated excessive credit growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.35,0)">A group of countries – including China, Japan, and oil-exporting economies – were saving too much, while others – such as the US – were heavily borrowing to finance consumption and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.99,0)">These developments were unsustainable in the long-run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.06,0)">At the same time, in an environment characterised by low interest rates, a global search for yield may have led investors to take on too much risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.16,0)">On the micro side, it became apparent that market participants’ incentives were not aligned with the risks they were taking, and that some investors were not fully aware of the extent of their exposures, which contributed to the under-pricing of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.97,0)">In the banking sector in particular, deficiencies in the design of the prudential framework for banks, in the supervisory review of banks’ risk management procedures and in the rules for compensation and pay were some of the microeconomic factors leading to important vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Regulatory and supervisory initiatives currently under discussion After witnessing the first global banking crisis since the Great Depression, it became clear that it was absolutely crucial to get the banking sector on a sound footing again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Policy makers responded rather quickly and forcefully to the crisis, which resulted in a wide-encompassing reform agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This reform agenda is very ambitious and time-wise rather tight, but before describing the measures under discussion, let me first briefly introduce the main actors in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The G20 provides the political and strategic impetus for the reforms, with the Financial Stability Board   playing an important role in the policy coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Various committees and working groups, of which the most prominent is the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, are charged with reviewing specific international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">As regards the reform agenda, the most important issues are the following: the adoption of high-quality capital and liquidity standards for banks, measures to reduce the financial system’s procyclicality, the introduction of a regulatory framework for systemically important financial institutions, the regulation of credit rating agencies and hedge funds, improving OTC derivatives markets, and finally, sound compensation practices that support financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">These issues are comprehensively addressed by the Basel Committee’s reform package that aims to strengthening the banking sector’s resilience and represents a cornerstone of the response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The package, which was released at the end of last year for consultation, aims at improving the quality and consistency of bank capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">It also considers the introduction of a non-risk-based leverage ratio as a supplementary capital measure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">This leverage ratio is expected to curb excessive balance sheet growth and to set a floor for the Basel II capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In order to mitigate the inherent pro-cyclical nature of financial activities, to which I will return later, the Basel Committee’s proposals also contain capital buffers and forward-looking provisioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Finally, the proposals include global minimum liquidity risk requirements enabling credit institutions to withstand a short-term liquidity stress and aiming to ensure longer-term stability in their funding requirments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The objective of this comprehensive package is to enable financial institutions to better withstand the adverse effects of economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">In order to assess the cumulative impact of the proposals, quantitative impact assessments are underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The outcome will be available in the coming weeks, and will assist decision-makers in properly calibrating the measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.85,0)">At this stage, therefore, it is premature for me to say anything about the desirable calibration of the measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Nevertheless, I am of the view that the measures are warranted from a conceptual point of view, though their cumulative impact needs to be carefully assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Indeed, it is important that the right balance is struck between enhancing banking stability and maintaining a stable provision of credit to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.22,0)">What has been done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The main strands of the reform agenda I come to paint are at various stages of development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It is therefore useful to briefly run through what has already been achieved, in particular in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Starting with the prudential framework for banks, most FSB members, including the EU Member States, have fully implemented the more risk-sensitive Basel II framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Amendments to the trading book are due to be implemented no later than the end of 2011 to address the problem of excessively low capital charges for trading activities in the pre-crisis period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In the EU, the appropriate measures are included in amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive, the so-called CRD3 package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The FSB just finished its peer review on how its members implemented the agreed principles for sound compensation practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In the EU, the CRD3 has specifically included banks’ remuneration policies in the supervisory review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">An EU regulation on credit rating agencies – which will come into effect at the end of 2010 – was adopted last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The European Commission has recently proposed amendments to the regulation which aim to introduce a centralised framework for supervision of the agencies at the EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Under the new supervisory framework, an European Securities and Markets Authority with oversight and supervisory powers over credit rating agencies will be established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.07,0)">Efforts in this field aim to address some shortcomings of the credit rating sector revealed by the crisis, such as conflicts of interest, poor rating quality and insufficient transparency about the methods used for their evaluations and the procedures for rating decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">A legislative proposal that establishes regulatory and supervisory standards for hedge funds is also under consideration in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Finally the two major accounting standard setters, IASB and FASB, are continuing their efforts to achieve convergence of accounting standards, though it might not be possible to keep to the initially agreed time table.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">I turn now to a very important response in Europe to the crisis, which is of particular interest for the ECB: the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board or ESRB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This new body will be responsible for macro-prudential supervision in the whole EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.93,0)">In contrast to micro-prudential supervision, which focuses on the financial soundness of individual institutions, macro-prudential supervision looks at the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.8,0)">Up to the late 1990s, the predominant view of policy makers was that if individual institutions were financially sound, the financial system as a whole would also be fine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.68,0)">Unfortunately, this is not always the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.48,0)">Through various channels, institutions can be inter-linked so that problems emerging from one or some of them may spill over to the rest of the financial sector, setting in motion an adverse dynamic that affects all of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">A macro-prudential perspective, looking beyond the conditions of each institution in isolation, should help to detect and prevent such system-wide potential problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Of course, there were already in place mechanisms for the monitoring and assessment of financial stability well before the financial crisis erupted, as evidenced by the financial stability reports published by the various central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.15,0)">But the financial crisis also demonstrated fundamental weaknesses in practices: First, while various central banks engaged in their own financial stability analysis there was not really a comprehensive analysis covering the whole EU and all elements of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.98,0)">Second, many of the analyses expressed serious concerns, such as the persistence of global imbalances and the investors’ hunt for higher yields, but these concerns were not sufficiently followed-up by concrete action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">There is therefore a need to improve the interplay between micro- and macro-prudential supervision since many tools to correct for possible risks are in the micro-prudential realm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">To this aim, the ESRB will be able to issue risk warnings and, where appropriate, recommendations and follow-up on their implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The legislative proposals for the establishment of the ESRB that are currently being discussed among the relevant European institutions foresee an important role for the ECB in the ESRB and we stand ready to take up this role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">We will do this with the support of the other members of the European System of Central Banks  , the constellation of the national central banks of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The ECB will support the ESRB by providing analytical, logistical and administrative support to the ESRB as well as the ESRB Secretariat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Preparatory work at the ECB is underway so that the ESRB can take up its work right after its formal establishment, which is expected for early next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The ECB is also in the process of enhancing its own capabilities for monitoring and assessing financial stability risks, not least to provide high-quality analytical input to the ESRB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">In the pursuit of this objective, we also try to draw as much as possible from synergies with existing work and resources both within the ECB and the ESCB, as well as at the supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">I conclude on this point that the establishment of ESRB will be a watershed event in developing a macro-prudential framework for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.9,0)">Having said that, I should also say that the ESRB does not have an easy mission and it certainly faces many challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Macro-prudential supervision is relatively new, which implies that a well-established framework with a clear operational objective, as we know for monetary policy, must yet be set in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The ESRB will therefore have to develop its own thinking and strategy, and will probably have to advance in a pragmatic way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The interplay with the micro-prudential function will be crucial, not only because the ESRB will have to rely to a large extent on micro-prudential supervisors for the information and the data, but also because a number of the tools that can be expected to address potential weaknesses in the financial system are of a micro-prudential nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In that respect, I should recall that the ESRB will not have any binding powers but will have to rely on moral suasion and peer pressure for the follow-up to its risk warnings and recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">And finally the ESRB will have to strive for effectiveness and efficiency in the pursuit of its tasks, given its relatively wide composition  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">V. A look into the future Taking a forward-looking perspective, I am sure that one of the important topics that will be on the ESRB’s agenda is that of the systemically important financial institutions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">These institutions are major contributors to what in the financial jargon is known as “systemic risk” and are, therefore, of great interest to macro-prudential supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.9,0)">How to gauge the contribution of a financial institution to systemic risk, in other words how to identify a SIFI, is a very difficult task, not least because of data limitations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Nevertheless, there are a number of factors that seem to be particularly relevant, such as the size of the institution, its interconnectedness with the rest of the financial system and the degree of substitutability in the event of a failure of the critical services they provide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is clear that any such assessment cannot be exclusively based on a quantitative approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Rather, the informed judgment of the relevant authorities, guided by internationally agreed principles, will play an important role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.87,0)">Indeed, the concept of systemic risk is fuzzy and still under debate, but, with a certain degree of simplification, it can be defined as the risk of an impairment in the financial system that has potentially serious negative consequences for the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.66,0)">For example, the actual default of a major bank may seriously affect depositors’ savings   and the financing of otherwise profitable investment projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.79,0)">But even in case of no actual default, SIFIs may pose serious challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.71,0)">Because of the potentially high damage to the financial system and the real economy in case of default, there is the expectation that governments and supervisors would not let a SIFI fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">This implicit support may provide an incentive to the institution to engage in profitable but risky activities, giving rise to “moral hazard”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">It also means that a SIFI can finance itself at a lower cost compared to other similar institutions, which are not deemed to be systemically important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.61,0)">In short, incentives are misaligned and the playing field is distorted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.7,0)">These problems have probably increased in the wake of the financial crisis following some of the voluntary, and less-voluntary, marriages among institutions that have created even bigger and more complex financial groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Reflecting these concerns, at the G20 summit of April last year in London, it was decided that SIFIs should be subject to an appropriate degree of regulation and oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">At the same time, the G20 entrusted the FSB with the task of overseeing concrete regulatory steps and monitoring their implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The FSB is now considering various policy options to address the concerns I mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.96,0)">In general terms, there are two ways to address ex ante the problems that SIFIs pose: you can restrict the scope of their activities or force them to internalise the costs they pose to the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The clearest illustration of the first approach is the discussion on the “  Conversely, as demonstrated in the run up to the crisis, price stability is not sufficient to safeguard financial stability, but it is certainly a necessary condition for it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Indeed, it reduces the system’s vulnerability to the build-up of financial imbalances and the scope for risk mispricing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.28,0)">The financial crisis has well illustrated how the monetary policy transmission channel can be seriously hampered in the absence of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This points to the many benefits from leaning against the build-up of financial imbalances, while pursuing the price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">To some extent, successful macro-prudential policy could alleviate the need for monetary policy to “lean against the wind” as regards unsustainable financial trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The two policy areas should however operate with a clearly distinct set of tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Effective governance arrangements need to be in place, so as to maximise credibility and preserve institutional independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Conclusions Ladies and gentlemen, I started my talk with a reference to architecture and, as we progressed, I reviewed the many building sites – at various stages of development – of the reforming financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.31,0)">It will be very challenging to keep momentum in the reform agenda and to keep the activities of the many building sites on track as “battle fatigue” inevitably settles in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">But the crisis has also painfully demonstrated that sound foundations are indispensable to withstand the occasional blows that hit the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Therefore, it is all the more important to continue vigorously pursuing the ambitious financial reform agenda.</span>
