    <span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)"> Looking at EU and euro area enlargement from a central banker’s angle: the views of the ECB Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank,Diplomatic Institute Sofia, 27 February 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, I am very honoured to be able to speak here today before such a distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">I would like to thank our hosts for their kind invitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">I must say, I actually feel quite at home here at the Diplomatic Institute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">I would like to share with you today my views as a central banker on an issue that has many dimensions, namely EU enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Of course I will focus my attention on the economic and, in particular, the monetary aspects of this process, and on the issue of euro area enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Permettez-moi, Mesdames et Messieurs, de commencer mon intervention par quelques mots en français.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">En effet, la Bulgarie est membre à part entière du mouvement de la francophonie ; à cet égard, dans moins de trois mois, la Banque nationale bulgare accueillera la treizième réunion des gouverneurs des banques centrales des pays francophones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">J’ai toujours pris part à ces réunions avec le plus vif intérêt; cette année aussi, j’aurai le plaisir de revenir à Sofia à la mi-mai comme invité du Gouverneur Iskrov pour une réunion consacrée à la stabilité financière.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Avant de présenter la structure de mon discours, permettez moi d’abord de faire une remarque d’ordre général.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Je crois que l’on est pas toujours sensible au fait que l’élargissement n’est pas un présent offert aux nouveaux Etats membres; en effet, pour ceux qui souhaitent adhérer, l’élargissement occasionne à la fois un travail assidu et aussi parfois des choix difficiles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Je ne veux pas dire par là qu’il faudrait qu’il en soit autrement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Prenez par exemple le monde du sport: lorsqu’un sportif rejoint sa nouvelle équipe, c’est lui qui doit travailler dur pour faire évoluer son talent et c’est d’abord lui qui doit s’ajuster au style de jeu de l’équipe, et non le contraire.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Ceci garantit l’efficacité et permet à l’équipe de fonctionner comme une équipe plutôt qu’un ensemble d’individus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Ceci dit, l’équipe doit aussi savoir apprécier les efforts d’ajustement importants du nouveau venu car elle peut devenir plus forte grâce à lui.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Par conséquent, je respecte et j’admire les autorités et le peuple bulgares pour leur travail assidu dans leurs préparatifs à l’entrée dans l’Union Européenne   Let me continue in English and set out the structure of my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">There are two main facets of preparing for accession that I will focus on today because they are particularly relevant from an economic point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The first concerns catching up to play at the level of the team.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">For the economy, this entails institutional development and stable macroeconomic policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In the first part of my speech, I will deal with Bulgaria’s achievements and the outstanding challenges in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The second facet is the commitment to play along with the rules and strategy of the team.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In this part, I will set out the path to eventual euro adoption that would need to be followed when Bulgaria joins the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I will illustrate some of the challenges that tend to arise along this path, drawing on our experiences with the new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">So, how has Bulgaria done in terms of institutional development and stable macroeconomic policy-making?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The first indicator that you have done well is the European Commission’s Comprehensive Monitoring Report for 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.59,0)">The Report makes clearly the difference between the institutional realm where shortcomings are stressed and the economic preparation which is judged rather positively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">It notes, for instance, that the rule of law must be strengthened and that more should be done to combat corruption and organised crime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The economy, on the other hand, is described as having “a high degree of macroeconomic stability with strong economic growth, relatively low inflation and falling unemployment”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Moreover, it states that continuing the current pace of reform will make the economy robust to competitive pressure and market forces within the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">I agree with the Commission that economic progress in Bulgaria has been significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Of course this has not been automatic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.74,0)">It is the result of difficult choices taken and a lot of hard work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">So, let me mention three aspects of this preparatory process that seem to me particularly important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">First, the introduction of a currency board arrangement eight years ago was a significant decision on Bulgaria’s road towards economic and monetary stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The currency board has been successful in finally bringing much-needed macroeconomic stability to post-communist Bulgaria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This has been helped by its strong credibility both with the Bulgarian population and internationally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">So clearly, it has been the backbone for macroeconomic stability in your country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Second, I would like to highlight the policy consistency of the various successive policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">You understood from the outset that currency board arrangement can only be sustained if supporting policies are in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me emphasise in particular the role of fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.4,0)">As you know, a currency board does not allow for discretion in the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.4,0)">Indeed, monetary policy becomes entirely endogenous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.68,0)">So, the only macroeconomic management tool at the disposal of policy-makers is fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">I find that the conduct of fiscal policy in Bulgaria has been appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Before looking at some numbers, I would like to stress that what impresses me most is that fiscal management has remained prudent over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">The broad consensus among policy-makers on the absolute need to follow a prudent fiscal policy has prevented harmful policy reversals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This is also shown by the figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">When I look at the deficit and debt performance between 1997 and 2005, I see that the budget position has remained consistently close to balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">I also see that fiscal policy has judiciously been tightened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The surplus increased to 2.4% of GDP last year and I understand that a 3% surplus has been agreed upon for this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This will certainly contribute to the maintenance of macroeconomic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The third and final facet I want to touch upon concerns cooperation, and I would like to focus here on cooperation in the field of central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">When I said earlier that the entrant does most of the adjustment, I meant most, not all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The team also prepares for the entry of the new member.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The European System of Central Banks   has worked with Bulgaria to prepare it to join the EU and the ESCB, involving activities at many levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">An early example was the cooperation project involving the Bulgarian National Bank, the Banque de France and De Nederlandsche Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">As part of this project, experts exchanged knowledge and experience on issues such as forecasting tools for bank reserves, risk management processes and the cash operations strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">I believe that such cooperation helps in itself to create a family spirit among the central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">It forms a good example of what such cooperation can achieve in mobilising our vast amount of knowledge and expertise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Indeed, the cooperation was so good that the project was commended by the European Commission for setting an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We have followed up on this with a new project, which has just started and, besides the original participants, also includes the Banca d’Italia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">In general, cooperation between Bulgaria and the ESCB now extends across most areas of central banking, from exchanging statistics to our annual bilateral policy dialogue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Moreover, since the signing of the Accession Treaty, the Bulgarian National Bank has participated as an observer in the ECB’s General Council and in meetings of ESCB committees and task forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">In this way, Bulgaria is already contributing to the work of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Besides these successes, there are naturally also challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Let me now turn to what are in my view the two most important economic challenges that still remain for Bulgaria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.54,0)">As I mentioned earlier, growing external imbalances are seen as a possible source for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">From the economic literature, we know about the difficulty of assessing the sustainable level of the current account, particularly in the context of transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">But the recent dynamic of Bulgaria’s external accounts indisputably calls for enhanced vigilance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This dynamic has been largely fed by robust credit growth to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">In this context, the measures taken by the Bulgarian National Bank   to contain credit expansion are fully justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.02,0)">Their impact has already been visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">At the same time, we should be aware of the limitations of these measures in an environment of an open capital account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">I have no doubt that the Bulgarian National Bank will continue to monitor the situation closely and take additional measures if necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Let me now turn to inflation, which is certainly a major challenge on the road to future EMU membership after entry in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.63,0)">Indeed, at 6.5% at the end of last year, headline inflation is high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">That there remains a lot to be done to fully control inflation is illustrated by its volatility over the recent years, moving from 10.3% in 2000 down to 2.3% in 2003 and now back up again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Fiscal policy and the stepping-up of structural reforms will play a key role in efforts to contain inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">I know that the Bulgarian authorities are aware of these challenges and I encourage them to exert sufficient vigilance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">It is particularly important as regards the stated objective of Bulgaria to enter the exchange rate mechanism   quickly after accession and to do what will be necessary to join the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">I appreciate very much your determination to do all what is necessary to meet the ultimate goal that you have in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As you know the ECB, when time comes, will apply a very simple principle when making its judgement: the criteria set out by the Treaty will have to be met in a sustainable fashion, nothing but the criteria and all the criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Euro area enlargement This brings me to the second part of my speech, in which I will discuss the path towards joining the euro area that should be followed upon accession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Along this path, every team member can have their own style, as long as the style respects the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.43,0)">Pre-euro-entry “euroisation” for example is not acceptable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I will now explain in more detail the process of monetary integration and the rules that apply to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.79,0)">With the exception of Denmark and the United Kingdom, EU Member States do not have an opt-out clause.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The path towards euro adoption is embedded in a well-defined multilateral institutional framework and comprises three phases: The first phase is the period from EU accession up to the country joining ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In this phase, the respective Member States continue to be fully responsible for their monetary and exchange rate policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Yet, EU Member States are required to treat their exchange rate policies as a matter of common interest and pursue price stability as the primary objective of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">More generally, during this phase, Member States are expected to undertake major policy adjustments – such as to implement a credible fiscal consolidation path and advance with price liberalisation – in order to already prepare for the next steps of monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The second phase relates to participation in ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As you know, the mechanism defines a regime characterised by fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates, with a mutually agreed central rate against the euro and a standard fluctuation band of   vous vous êtes engagés dans une voie qui requiert parfois des choix difficiles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Grâce à la cohérence de votre politique, en particulier dans le domaine budgétaire, vous avez prouvé que vous êtes à la hauteur de la tâche.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">De plus, la Banque nationale bulgare a démontré sa capacité de coopération au sein du SEBC.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">En résumé, je crois que la Bulgarie s’est bien engagée dans la voie des efforts pour préparer son économie à l’entrée dans l’Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Bulgaria has made noticeable progress in terms of conducting a stable macroeconomic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">With the currency board, you have embarked upon a path that sometimes requires tough choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Through policy-consistency, especially in the fiscal realm, you have shown you are up to the task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Moreover, the Bulgarian National Bank has demonstrated its capacity for cooperation with the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In short, I believe Bulgaria has correctly engaged itself in preparing its economy for EU entry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I have also set out the process of monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">There, I have emphasised the importance of playing along with the team and respecting the rules that come with each of the three stages of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.99,0)">There are several challenges associated with the process of monetary integration, which I discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.98,0)">At the current juncture, the main challenge for Bulgaria with regard to nominal convergence will be price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">I noted the importance of using structural policy, not temporary measures, to contain inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Amongst the other challenges that Bulgaria is presently facing, I would like to mention the level of the current account deficit and the rapidity of the growth of outstanding credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">All these challenges call for a high level of prudence in the fiscal policy - which I understand is the policy of the government - and a careful monitoring of the unit labour cost which is always of the essence in such circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In that context, I also touched upon the speed of entry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There, my main message is, do not worry about whether it will be quick or slow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The team is ready and happy to receive new members when they are ready and patient for them to become ready.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But before I set out the structure of what I will say, let me first make a general remark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I believe it is not always fully appreciated that enlargement is not simply a present to the new entrants; indeed, for those who want to join, enlargement entails both hard work and, sometimes, difficult choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">And I am not saying that it should be any other way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Take the world of sport, for example: when a sportsman joins a new team, it is he who must work hard to improve his skills and it is he primarily who must adjust to playing the styles and techniques of the team, not the other way around.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This is efficient and enables the team to function as a team instead of as a set of individuals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">That said, the team should appreciate that the new entrant makes most of the efforts of adjustment and that the team can become stronger as a result of the new entrant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">So, I respect and admire the Bulgarian authorities and the Bulgarian people for your hard work in preparing to join the EU.</span>
