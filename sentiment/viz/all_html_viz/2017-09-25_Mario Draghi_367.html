    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)"> Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECON committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 25 September 2017 Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to be back speaking to your committee for the third hearing of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">A year ago, we were discussing together the moderate pace of the recovery in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.38,0)">We were witnessing a slight loss of momentum and assessing the impact of the UK referendum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Over the past 12 months, however, the recovery has accelerated and broadened, supported by the pass-through of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In my remarks today I will discuss the current economic outlook and the impact of our monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">At the request of the committee, I will focus in particular on two topics related to the ECB’s monetary policy, namely the corporate sector purchase programme   and monetary policy implementation across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The economic and inflation outlook The economic expansion is now firm and broad-based across euro area countries and sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Real GDP growth was better than expected in the first half of 2017, coming in at 2.3%, year on year, in the second quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The euro area economy has enjoyed 17 consecutive quarters of growth, and the latest information indicates continued momentum in the period ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The ongoing recovery is, crucially, driven by domestic forces, and the labour market has notably improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.53,0)">The unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest level in eight years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The number of people employed in the euro area has increased by almost 7 million since mid-2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">These employment gains, together with increasing household wealth, are supporting the private consumption outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Moreover, investment is improving, buoyed by very favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The domestic drivers are making the recovery more robust and resilient to adverse external influences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">According to the September ECB staff macroeconomic projections, the economic expansion will continue at growth rates above potential over the projection horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Annual real GDP is projected to increase by 2.2% in 2017, by 1.8% in 2018 and by 1.7% in 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Risks surrounding the euro area growth outlook are broadly balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.64,0)">At the same time, downside risks continue to exist, mainly related to global factors and developments in foreign exchange markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The firm economic recovery still needs to translate more convincingly into stronger inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.88,0)">As I reported already in the past, deflation risks have essentially disappeared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Nevertheless, measures of underlying inflation have picked up only moderately over recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.8,0)">Headline inflation, which was 1.5% in August, is expected to temporarily decline towards the turn of the year, driven mainly by base effects in the energy component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Afterwards, it is expected to pick up gradually, reaching 1.5% in 2019, according to the ECB staff projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Overall, we are becoming more confident that inflation will eventually head to levels in line with our inflation aim, but we also know that a very substantial degree of monetary accommodation is still needed for the upward inflation path to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.64,0)">Moreover, we still see some uncertainties with respect to the medium-term inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.48,0)">Most notably, the recent volatility in the exchange rate represents a source of uncertainty which requires monitoring with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">We therefore need to be patient and persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">An upward adjustment of headline inflation that is durable and self-sustained requires a further absorption of economic slack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This, in turn, still requires a very ample degree of monetary policy accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">With this in mind, we will decide later this year on a re-calibration of our instruments that maintains the degree of monetary support that the euro area economy still needs to complete its transition to a new balanced growth trajectory characterised by sustained conditions of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The corporate sector purchase programme The package of monetary policy measures that we have phased in sequentially since June 2014 has led to a significant easing in financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">What is very apparent today, and very difficult to dispute, is that this monetary policy impetus is increasingly leading to stronger economic activity, higher incomes and better employment prospects for people in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">One key factor has been our ability to activate non-standard instruments that can transmit additional stimulus to the productive sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">In fact, transmission through the banking system has become increasingly effective since we began adopting credit-easing measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I am referring here specifically to the expanded asset purchase programme  , but a similar case can be made for our targeted longer-term refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">At the request of the committee, let me focus on one component of the APP, namely the CSPP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Together with the purchase of asset-backed securities and covered bonds, the CSPP represents an important credit-easing component of the APP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">By directly lowering the market-based financing costs of non-financial corporations, it boosts the pass-through of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Under the CSPP, the Eurosystem has since June 2016 purchased bonds issued by a wide range of non-bank corporations established in the euro area, which include large, as well as some smaller, companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">So far, close to €110 billion of corporate bonds from around 200 issuers, in 20 countries, across all sectors, have been purchased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This information is available on our website and in our publications, and is updated regularly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">We continue to analyse possibilities for sharing more information, to the extent that it can enhance transparency without undermining the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Thanks to our corporate bond purchases, firms in the euro area have witnessed significant improvements in their financing conditions when issuing bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">But these improvements in financing conditions stemming from the CSPP are not confined to the companies whose bonds are purchased or to the corporate bond market: they are evident across firms and other market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.78,0)">For example, the yield spreads of high-rated corporate bonds that are not eligible for purchase – namely those issued by financial corporations – have fallen by as much as those of eligible bonds issued by non-financial corporations   since the CSPP announcement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.76,0)">Spreads of non-investment grade corporate bonds, which are not eligible for the CSPP, have also declined by 262 basis points, from 5.59% in March 2016 to 2.97%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">For asset purchases to boost activity and inflation, however, these improvements in financial markets need to be passed through into credit conditions for the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In this regard, we have seen very favourable spillovers into credit conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.1,0)">As more corporations seek market-based financing, given the attractive funding conditions prevailing in the capital markets, banks are left with greater capacity to provide loans to smaller companies, which are more constrained in terms of access to funding sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.91,0)">Hence, bank lending rates on very small loans to non-financial corporations have declined by around 50 basis points since the CSPP announcement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Looking at our latest Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises, smaller companies are indeed reporting improved financing conditions and better access to finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The CSPP, therefore, has strengthened the pass-through of our asset purchases to the financing conditions of the real economy and has contributed to the overall monetary stimulus needed to bring inflation rates back in line with our inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Conducting monetary policy in the euro area The supportive impact of our policy measures – including all elements of our asset purchase programme – on financing conditions is therefore evident across firms regardless of their size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">It is also evident across sectors and across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">In other words, we are seeing a smooth transmission of our single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">A single currency entails a single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Hence, the Governing Council takes decisions to achieve the primary objective of maintaining price stability for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It also establishes the necessary guidelines for their implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">At the same time, and in accordance with its Statute,  the ECB has recourse to the national central banks   to the extent deemed possible and appropriate for carrying out the operations which form part of the tasks of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">NCBs in turn have a duty to act in accordance with the guidelines and instructions of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This decentralised approach takes into consideration the financial structure of the euro area, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.59,0)">a monetary union made up of segmented national financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In such an environment, the close interaction of NCBs with the banks operating in their jurisdiction brings benefits for the implementation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">For example, we are able to collect precise information from a wide range of local counterparties, which can be integrated into the harmonised and rich information set that the Governing Council needs to design policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Moreover, NCBs, knowing well the specificities of their jurisdictions, are well placed to manage assets to be used as collateral in our operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This makes our decentralised system more efficient than a centralised approach under the current circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.2,0)">In the absence of a truly single market for capital, securities markets still depend very much on national specificities and preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">A successful capital markets union would abolish dividing lines between jurisdictions, with positive effects on the way we implement our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In the end, we should not forget that a fundamental reason for monetary union was precisely to foster more integrated capital markets and reap the benefits in the form of improved financing conditions across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Conclusion Since you asked me to elaborate on the issue of decentralisation, let me conclude with a final thought in this respect and in particular on the implications for the functioning of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The fact that the ECB’s non-standard policy measures have been very effective in supporting the financing conditions of companies and households throughout the euro area should not make us forget the situation we witnessed at the peak of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.49,0)">For example, institutional weaknesses, structural fragilities and excessive risk-taking contributed to a negative feedback loop between sovereigns and banks in some countries, which significantly impaired monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.47,0)">The resultant contraction in the euro area economy threatened price stability, our primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Overcoming this vicious circle required considerable effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The pattern is now running in reverse, with positive spillovers from all countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">They all have benefited from our measures supporting growth across all of the euro area and thus laying the ground for a sustained return of inflation to levels in line with our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.98,0)">But while a cyclical adjustment has been taking place, there are still structural issues which impede sustainable economic convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In the years to come, a higher degree of sustained convergence and strengthened resilience will be necessary in order to achieve a better-functioning Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">This requires, on the one hand, policy actions by national governments aimed at unlocking the productive potential of our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">On the other hand, further decisive steps are needed to make Economic and Monetary Union’s economic governance truly fit for purpose.</span>
