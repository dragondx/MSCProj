    <span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)"> Investing in our climate, social and economic resilience: What are the main policy priorities?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the opening plenary session of the European Parliamentary Week 2021 in virtual format Frankfurt am Main, 22 February 2021 I would like to thank you warmly for inviting me to speak to you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">It is a privilege to have an opportunity to talk to the citizens’ representatives at the heart of European democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Events like this one allow us to consider national debates in discussions about our common challenges as Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">For all of us, the past year of the pandemic has been an extraordinary challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">And, at all levels, the public policy response has been truly impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">National responses have spearheaded the policy effort, with fiscal measures amounting to, on average, 4.5% of euro area GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Yet the response to this crisis stands out from previous ones in that the level of policy alignment achieved has been truly unprecedented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The strength of Europe’s crisis response has crucially depended on the strength of national and European responses across all areas: monetary, fiscal, supervisory and regulatory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.17,0)">But the pandemic is not over yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Policy alignment will continue to be imperative for what lies ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">So I would like to look at the ways in which our policies can keep reinforcing each other in addressing two common challenges: shielding the economy and subsequently transforming it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Shielding the economy While people are drawing hope from the start of vaccination campaigns, the first challenge – “shielding” – calls for us to continue to bridge the gap until widespread immunity is achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.22,0)">Across Europe, people are still grappling with the economic and social consequences of the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.82,0)">And it is still highly uncertain how the next stages of the pandemic will unfold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In this context, our pandemic emergency purchase programme   has been tailored to the pandemic, helping to stabilise markets and ease our policy stance to support the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">It will continue to be a crucial tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The PEPP envelope of €1.85 trillion gives us considerable firepower and flexibility in conducting purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Moreover, our targeted longer-term refinancing operations will remain an attractive source of funding for banks, supporting the flow of credit to households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.09,0)">SMEs tend to benefit disproportionately from abundant and cheap credit, and smaller firms have been able to borrow at the lowest rates ever recorded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The ECB will continue to support all sectors of the economy by preserving favourable financing over the pandemic period, as it has done since the start of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This commitment implies looking at indicators along the whole transmission chain of our monetary policy – from risk-free rates to government borrowing costs to capital markets to bank lending for firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Within the broad-based set of indicators that we monitor to assess whether financing conditions are still favourable, risk-free overnight indexed swap   rates and sovereign yields are particularly important, because they are good early indicators of what happens at downstream stages of monetary policy transmission, since banks use those yields as a reference when setting the price of their loans to households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Accordingly, the ECB is closely monitoring the evolution of longer-term nominal bond yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The overall policy mix, however, remains essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">While the pandemic persists – and lockdowns and heightened uncertainty continue – firms and households will only be able to take full advantage of favourable financing conditions if national policy measures are deployed to help monetary policy unfold its full potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">By continuing to take the lead in protecting the firms and sectors most exposed to the crisis, fiscal policy can help brighten economic prospects for firms and households, thereby strengthening monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.1,0)">The ECB’s Consumer Expectations Survey demonstrates this: people who consider government support to be more adequate display less precautionary behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Those people are in turn more likely to respond to favourable financing conditions and increase their consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In the euro area, the budget balance is expected to be -6.1% of GDP in 2021.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">With monetary and fiscal policies working in tandem, we hope that we will finally cross the bridge and reach the other side of the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Transforming the economy The second policy challenge will arise as the economy gradually reopens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And this second challenge will be quite a different one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It won’t be about returning to the pre-pandemic status quo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">It will be about bringing the economy rapidly back to potential, while using the thrust of the recovery to transform our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.74,0)">The focus will then be on reducing the damage caused by the pandemic, such as permanent job reductions, which one in five firms are considering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">At the same time, it will be crucial to harness the potential offered by the pandemic, which has spurred a multi-year leap in digital progress and has brought a new focus on sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Digital and green technologies present massive possibilities for more vibrant, inclusive and sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In the energy sector alone, scaling up green investment to the necessary levels could create an estimated 1.1 million jobs across Europe by 2030.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Europe is leading the way in addressing this double policy challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Its Next Generation EU   recovery package is designed to support demand today and generate growth potential tomorrow through investment and reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Indeed, NGEU is expected to provide, on average, around 1% of GDP in grants and loans per year over the next three years, while committing 37% of funds to green investment, and 20% to digital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Next to EU policies, national policy action will have to play a vital enabling role in smoothing the transition and promoting change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">First, by ensuring that NGEU funds can be fully operational when the decisions on own resources are ratified in all Member States, which in many cases involves national parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">And second, by creating the right economic environment to boost the impact of NGEU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This means improving the quality of government spending and ensuring that NGEU is firmly rooted in sound structural policies conceived and implemented at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">If used for productive public investment, NGEU funds could increase real output in the euro area by around 1.5% of GDP over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">So these must be priority areas if we are to reform, modernise and come out of this crisis with renewed vigour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude by emphasising that all of us, across all policy levels, must pull together to meet our shared challenges and ensure that Europe can emerge stronger from the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Today, 22 February, is the birthday of Lord Robert Baden-Powell, the pioneer of scouting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The scout’s motto, “be prepared” is apt for us too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">For Europe to be prepared and bring about positive change in 2021 and beyond, national and European decision-makers need to uphold our team effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The ECB will continue to play its part.</span><span style="background-color:
