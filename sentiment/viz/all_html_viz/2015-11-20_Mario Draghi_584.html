    <h1> Monetary Policy: Past, Present and Future </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress, 20 November 2015 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)"> Monetary Policy: Past, Present and Future Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,at the Frankfurt European Banking Congress, 20 November 2015 *** The ECB’s monetary policy measures have clearly worked, in fact they are probably the dominant force spurring the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">They have been instrumental in arresting and reversing the deflationary pressures that hit the euro a year ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.88,0)">Yet growth momentum remains weak and inflation remains well below our objective of below but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.01,0)">Composite lending rates for non-financial companies declined more than 70 basis points for the euro area as a whole between June 2014 and today, and by between 110 and 120 basis points in stressed economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">That is a formidable pass-through.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Small businesses also report improvements in access to external sources of finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.5,0)">To highlight three risks: global growth this year will be the weakest since 2009; this is the weakest euro area rebound since 1998; and the recovery remains very protracted in historical perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">We cannot say with confidence that the process of economic repair in the euro area is complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.41,0)">At the December Governing Council meeting we will thoroughly assess the strength and persistence of the factors that are slowing the return of inflation towards 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">If we conclude that the balance of risks to our medium-term price stability objective is skewed to the downside, we will act by using all the instruments available within our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">We consider the asset purchase programme to be a powerful and flexible instrument, as it can be adjusted in terms of size, composition or duration to achieve a more expansionary stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">The level of the deposit facility rate can also empower the transmission of APP, not least by increasing the velocity of circulation of bank reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">If we decide that the current trajectory of our policy is not sufficient to achieve our objective, we will do what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">That is what our price stability mandate requires of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">*** Dear Lord Mayor Feldmann, Your Excellencies, Dear Governors, Dear Mr Fitschen and Mr Blessing, Ladies and Gentlemen, A year ago in this venue I said that it was essential to bring back inflation to target without delay, and that monetary policy would do its part to achieve that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In the following months we took the decision to reinforce our credit easing measures and to expand our asset purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.26,0)">That decision reflected the very difficult situation the euro area found itself in late last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.67,0)">After a promising start in the spring of 2014, the economic recovery had faltered in the summer and, as the year drew to a close, we feared a renewed lapse into recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.11,0)">This would have come at a time when inflation was falling and inflation expectations were already clearly destabilised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.93,0)">Our price stability objective was under threat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Today, the economic recovery is on a firmer footing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Domestic demand is gradually strengthening and replacing exports as the engine of growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Consumption continues to be the main driver of real activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">And while global trade slowed remarkably in the first half of 2015, euro area export growth has held up relatively well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Our measures have therefore clearly worked – in fact, they are probably the dominant force spurring the recovery that we see today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">They have been instrumental in arresting and reversing the deflationary pressures that hit the euro area a year ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Nevertheless, that positive picture of the economy has to be seen in a wider context where risks still remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.79,0)">Though the recovery has proven resilient to shocks, growth momentum remains weak for an economy coming out of a deep recession, and the headwinds blowing from the global economy have increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The recovery in the path of real growth has also not yet been mirrored in the path of inflation, which still remains well below our objective of below but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">So what I would like to discuss in my remarks today is how and why our monetary policy measures have been effective and, in view of the prevailing risks, whether they are still providing sufficient monetary accommodation to secure our price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Effectiveness of asset purchases There are many reasons why asset purchases should have a strong impact on activity and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.46,0)">Purchases compress yields and reduce the cost of financing in the economy through direct pass-through and portfolio rebalancing effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">For banks they make lending to the real economy more attractive than purchasing government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Higher financial and real estate asset prices can also increase demand via wealth effects and lower the cost of equity for firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.77,0)">When we launched the APP, however, it was in an environment where the strength of these conventional transmission channels was questionable – at least in the eyes of some observers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.34,0)">One concern was that the impact of interventions might be meagre given that yields were already very low at the start of the purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">As such, savers selling securities to the ECB might not feel substantially richer and spend more, while borrowers might not perceive a material easing in their financing costs and borrow more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Indeed, at the launch of the APP nominal borrowing conditions for virtually all sovereign issuers were the most favourable in post-war history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.47,0)">But the low yields we saw in January were not a limiting factor on our programme; they were proof that it was already working.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.81,0)">Following our communication on our reaction function in the first half of last year  , interest rates had in fact been falling consistently over the months preceding the launch of APP, as markets began to price in our likely response to a prolonged period of too-low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.17,0)">Taking the GDP-weighted average of the euro area 10-year government bond yields, yields fell by around 150 basis points between early June 2014 and early March 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.05,0)">That also had spillover effects, through portfolio rebalancing, to the cost of market finance across the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.16,0)">Yields of bank bonds fell, on average, by 75 basis points between early June 2014 and the start of the APP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.3,0)">Yields of investment-grade bonds issued by firms also fell by about 100 basis points over that same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.95,0)">Studies by ECB staff attribute a significant portion of those declines to the credit easing package and the announcement of the APP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">For asset purchases to boost activity and inflation, however, these improvements in financial markets need to be passed through into credit conditions for the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.97,0)">Here there was another concern about the effectiveness of our policy – that with banks deleveraging, trying to enlist them as vehicles of monetary policy might be futile, as banks would retain the stimulus and try to deleverage rather than create more loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">In fact, the power of transmission through the banking system has been rising through the life of our programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.75,0)">Between June 2014 and today, composite lending rates for non-financial companies have declined by more than 70 basis points for the euro area as a whole, and by between 110 and 120 basis points in stressed economies in the euro area periphery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">That is a formidable pass-through.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.32,0)">To give you a comparison, we estimate that in normal times our policy rate has to be instantaneously reduced by 100 basis points to see a similar impact on lending rates after such a short time period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.2,0)">Banks’ rate-setting process is typically slow, but not this time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">And we are not only seeing this pass-through for larger firms, but also for small- and medium-sized enterprises  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Remember that at the height of the crisis in 2012, the rates on very small business loans, which are typically given to SMEs, were about 2.5 percentage points higher than those on large loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.17,0)">Other terms and conditions, such as collateral, were also more demanding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">As documented by our surveys on SME access to credit, at this time “access to finance” was considered the dominant concern for small enterprises, right after “finding customers” for their business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Our measures are gradually changing that picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.64,0)">Since the first round of our survey in April this year, “access to finance” has dropped to among the least important concerns for SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">They in fact report an improvement in the availability of external sources of finance, and in the willingness of banks to provide credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.38,0)">Terms and conditions have also sharply converged towards those enjoyed by large corporate borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.01,0)">So why has transmission been so accelerated?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There are two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">First, the APP was launched against the backdrop of the completion of our Comprehensive Assessment of bank balance sheets, which ensured that banks were in the strongest possible position to transmit the boost to credit supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Second, and even more fundamentally, banks’ lending processes react to macroeconomic conditions in a feedback loop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.41,0)">For much of the crisis, that loop was pernicious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">But our measures have been able to turn it positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.13,0)">When the economy was weak, banks tended to increase lending rates because they feared that the probability of default on their loans would rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.34,0)">Those higher rates meant good credit demand fell and the economy worsened further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.83,0)">As the slump deepened, servicing credit then became more difficult for firms and households with outstanding loans, pushing higher numbers of borrowers into delinquency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The loop then returned back to the beginning, as banks’ original increase in lending rates was validated ex post.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Starting in the summer of 2014, however, our measures began to increase competitive pressures on banks to reduce lending margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The Comprehensive Assessment meant that more banks were in a position to benefit from low funding costs and lend, while the Targeted Long Term Refinancing Operations   gave them stronger incentives to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Bank credit therefore became more affordable, which in turn stoked higher credit demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.18,0)">And as that has fed through into a better macro picture, loan delinquencies have fallen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.08,0)">Indeed, since the second quarter of this year non-performing loans   have been declining, even in those economies where banks had built up high stocks of bad quality assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">What this underlines is that policies that are good for the economy are good for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Even though low interest rates put pressure on banks‘ unit margins, that is compensated for by volume effects – there is more activity in the banking sector as a whole because monetary policy is supporting the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Moreover, as NPLs have started to go down banks have been able to reduce provisions, which also supports profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Evidence from our Bank Lending Survey suggests that, for the euro area in aggregate, the net impact of our measures on bank profitability is broadly neutral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.27,0)">The macroeconomic impact of our policy on small firms is already clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In the most recent October round of our survey, the number of SMEs reporting an increase in revenues was almost 20% larger than those which reported the opposite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The improvement has also been widespread across most countries, with the notable exception of Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">For the first time since 2009, the net percent of firms that register an improvement in business activity has turned positive for all size sub-groups, including for the micro-firms that had in the past suffered most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Reviving the supply of credit to these firms has also helped lay the ground for an economy-wide recovery in investment, activity and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Think that SMEs are 99 out of every 100 businesses in Europe, produce 58% of value added and employ two-thirds of all employees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">And those benefits have accrued not only to countries with a high concentration of SMEs, such as those in the euro area periphery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.12,0)">Removing the obstacles that have suppressed growth in those economies reverberates across the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In particular, the budding recovery in vulnerable countries today provides a partial cushion for exporters in core economies against the fall-off in demand from emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Between 2011 and late last year, extra-euro area exports were systematically stronger than intra-euro area exports for those countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.3,0)">But more recently, while shipment of goods and services to China, Russia and Brazil has dropped, export substitution to vulnerable countries has partly offset that shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Importantly, what this story shows is not just that our policy is effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.85,0)">It shows that concerns that asset purchases would lead only to asset price inflation, and that would benefit only more wealthy groups, were misguided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">It is true that our purchases raise the market value of financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">But what matters for the economy is the exact mirror effect of this: a lower cost of capital for firms and an associated boost in their spending power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.23,0)">That has a much broader impact on output and inflation, and eventually on employment and incomes, which reduces income inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.56,0)">Do we need to do more?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">So the economy is responding to our measures in the direction we had anticipated, and today we can look at our prospects with cautious confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The question we face now is not therefore whether we have the tools available to provide the appropriate degree of monetary stimulus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">We have proven that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">The question is one of calibration – whether, in view of the increasing headwinds we have faced since the summer and the impact they are having on the balance of risks for inflation going forward, the calibration of the monetary stance decided in January is still sufficient now to ensure a return of inflation towards our objective, and without undue delay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me highlight three risks in particular which are relevant for that calibration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.85,0)">First, the downside risks to our baseline scenario for the euro area economy have increased in recent months due to the deterioration of the external environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.14,0)">The outlook for global demand, especially in emerging markets, has notably worsened, while uncertainty in financial markets has increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.33,0)">Global growth this year will be the weakest since 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Second, even factoring in those headwinds, the strength of the underlying recovery is modest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.02,0)">Taking the Purchasing Managers’ Index, the present upswing which started in 2013 is the weakest euro area rebound since 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">That is striking considering that we are in the early phase of a recovery, where one would expect to see a much more vigorous pickup.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Deferred spending typically comes back on stream in a bulky way, aided by more favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">It is also striking considering the important tailwinds helping the economy along – not just our monetary stimulus, but lower prices for energy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.97,0)">None of those previous rebounds since 1998 could benefit from cheapening energy: in fact, oil prices have been a constant headwind blowing against previous recoveries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Moreover, in none of those previous upswings was monetary policy, measured by real EONIA rates, as supportive as it is now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.81,0)">Third, the recovery remains very protracted in historical perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">It took between five and eight quarters for the countries now making up the euro area to recover their pre-recession level of real output after the slumps of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.16,0)">During the recent recession – which was admittedly the worst since the 1930s – it took the US economy 14 quarters to reach its pre-crisis peak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">If our current assessment is correct, it will take the euro area 31 quarters to return to its pre-crisis level of output – that is, in 2016 Q1.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.25,0)">This matters not just because of the lost output in that time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.2,0)">Such a prolonged downturn also inevitably impacts the way firms and social partners set wages and prices, and this will continue to affect the recovery of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.39,0)">Though the most volatile components – principally energy prices – explain much of the recent decline in inflation, indicators of underlying inflation are also at a low level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.53,0)">That could imply relatively weak price pressures going forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.99,0)">We see subdued wage growth in the euro area, suggesting that the output gap is still exerting downward pressure on wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.73,0)">The so-called core measures of inflation – which strip out volatile components – have also been drifting down since mid-2012 when the euro crisis hit its climax, and have been hovering around 1% for nearly two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The increase in October to 1.1%, while encouraging, is not sufficient to fundamentally change that picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Low core inflation is not something we can be relaxed about, as it has in the past been a good forecaster for where inflation will stabilise in the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">And while core industrial goods will receive support from the depreciation of the euro, an increase in core services inflation – today close to an all-time minimum – will depend on rising nominal wage growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">For that to pick up the economy needs to move back to full capacity as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Putting the whole picture together, we have a situation where we cannot yet say with confidence that the process of economic repair in the euro area is complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The moderate growth and price dynamics imply that we need to monitor closely whether – if left to its own forces – the economy will be able to reach a self-sustaining growth trajectory in conditions of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">If not, then it will require more monetary stimulus, which the ECB will not hesitate to provide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.59,0)">At our December Governing Council meeting, we will thoroughly assess the strength and persistence of the factors that are slowing the return of inflation towards 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We will use as one input the Eurosystem staff projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Another input will be the work of our staff in consultation with the Eurosystem Committees on the monetary policy stimulus that has been achieved so far, and the range of instruments available in case more accommodation is seen as necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">If we conclude that the balance of risks to our medium-term price stability objective is skewed to the downside, we will act by using all the instruments available within our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">In particular, we consider the APP to be a powerful and flexible instrument, as it can be adjusted in terms of size, composition or duration to achieve a more expansionary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">The level of the deposit facility rate can also empower the transmission of APP, not least by increasing the velocity of circulation of bank reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.74,0)">In making our assessment of the risks to price stability, we will not ignore the fact that inflation has already been low for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Looking forward, monetary policy will remain accommodative for as long as needed to secure a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">That means we want to feel suitably confident that inflation will not only converge to, but also stabilise around levels close to 2% over the relevant medium-term horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">So let me reiterate what I said here last year: if we decide that the current trajectory of our policy is not sufficient to achieve that objective, we will do what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">That is what our price stability mandate requires of us.</span>
