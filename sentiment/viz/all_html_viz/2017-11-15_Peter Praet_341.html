    <h3> Speaker: Peter Praet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.41,0)"> Communicating the complexity of unconventional monetary policy in EMU Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 2017 ECB Central Bank Communications Conference, Frankfurt am Main, 15 November 2017 Central bank communication has been fundamentally affected by the fallout from the global financial and economic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Throughout that period, central banks succeeded in preventing a de-anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.75,0)">To do so, they adopted a broad range of unconventional measures, the functioning of which is very difficult to explain to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.34,0)">This applies, for example, to the notion of negative nominal interest rates, which is hard to communicate because it challenges the conventional wisdom that thrift and patience are virtues that deserve pecuniary remuneration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Against this backdrop, I would like to discuss three communication challenges that are particularly relevant to the euro area and the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The first challenge is to bear in mind the multi-country nature of our monetary union, which requires communication to be tuned to the specific context of different national audiences so as to ensure broad participation in the public debate on euro area monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The second challenge for monetary policy communication is to take into account the increasing complexity of monetary policy by ensuring consistency over time and clarifying the state contingency of the policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">To ensure consistency over time, it is essential for the central bank to adopt a clear organising framework, centred on the ultimate objective, for the ECB consisting of price stability, and adhering to a state-contingent reaction function that determines how the monetary policy stance adjusts to changing economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.58,0)">As the economic environment that monetary policy faces may indeed be subject to massive swings, state contingency may entail pronounced differences in the monetary policy stance over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.9,0)">This, in turn, requires careful explanation – in particular in circumstances that call for unconventional measures and, hence, leave markets and the general public without empirical precedent to help them anticipate and rationalise the central bank’s actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The third challenge is for the communication framework to provide clarity on the use of specific tools in a multi-instrument context, when the central bank reaction function acquires an additional dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.79,0)">In normal times, the central bank reaction function mainly specifies the contingencies for loosening, tightening or maintaining a given policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In unconventional times, it also needs to spell out which tool would provide the first margin of adjustment if a change in policy stance were to appear warranted, and how the adjustment in one policy instrument would interact with the others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Reflecting the multi-country nature of Economic and Monetary Union To gauge the complexity of monetary policy communication in a multi-country currency union, just consider some of the headlines on the expanded asset purchase programme   which appeared in major newspapers in different countries, both inside and outside the euro area, in January 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Starting from the outside perspective, reports in media outlets in the United States and the United Kingdom spanned the full spectrum, with some saying that the ECB’s “bond-buying proposal beats all expectations” and the ECB “gets it   right”, while others felt that the “stimulus may be too little or too late”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.4,0)">Within the euro area, newspapers in some countries claimed the ECB was a “central bank going the wrong way”, as the APP would fuel inflation and “make everything more expensive”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">In other countries the tone was markedly different, with the programme considered “convincing” and conducive to an economic environment in which “there’s no excuse for the recovery not to start”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In addition to this wide range of media perspectives, the crisis has had a profound impact on the way in which the public views institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.98,0)">For instance, judging from different Eurobarometer surveys, trust in European institutions, including the ECB, clearly declined during the crisis and has only started to recover in recent years  , while remaining consistently higher than the levels of trust enjoyed by national governments and parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.28,0)">The fall and rise in public trust in turn runs roughly in parallel with the performance of the economy, as reflected in, for instance, the unemployment rate – a point that also emerges from systematic empirical analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.55,0)">These levels of trust often coincide with a disconnect between, on the one hand, the way central banks communicate their policies and, on the other hand, the public’s perception and awareness of the goals that central banks try to achieve and the means by which they operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.92,0)">As Andy Haldane remarked earlier this year, this disconnect means that we, as central bankers, have to “rethink how and with whom we engage”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Figure 1: Evolution of trust in different European and national institutions and economic conditions   Sources: Standard Eurobarometer No 87 , published on 2 August 2017, and Eurostat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.01,0)">The Eurobarometer survey is conducted twice a year in spring   and autumn  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.17,0)">Figure 2: Cross-country dispersion in net trust in the ECB in euro area countries   Source: Standard Eurobarometer No 87, published on 2 August 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.32,0)">Net trust in the ECB is the percentage of respondents who trust the ECB minus the percentage of respondents who distrust the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.43,0)">The survey is conducted twice a year in spring   and autumn  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">The level of trust in the ECB also differed greatly across countries in the years following the crisis and the dispersion still remains above pre-crisis levels despite some recent declines  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.25,0)">Such widely differing perceptions across countries pose a challenge for central bank communication in our monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The ECB has sought to address this challenge with what I would refer to as a “two-layered federal structure of communication”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The first layer consists of a set of “centralised” communication channels through which the ECB discharges its duty to explain its euro area-wide policy conduct to the public and fulfils the accountability requirements vis-à-vis elected representatives as required by the Treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These channels include: the introductory statements at the press conferences following the Governing Council’s monetary policy meetings, in which the President explains our decisions and summarises the economic and monetary analysis on which they were based; the monetary policy accounts, which report, with additional detail, the deliberations leading up to the Governing Council’s decisions; speeches by Governing Council Members; a panoply of publications bringing together the economic, monetary and financial information that serves as input to the underlying policy assessments; and our public accountability vis-à-vis the European Parliament, in the form of our Annual Reports, the President’s testimony before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and our replies to questions from Members of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">These centralised communication channels are complemented by “decentralised” communication channels at national level where, in particular, the national central banks of the Eurosystem play an integral role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Equipped with in-depth knowledge of their respective economies, and – literally and figuratively – sharing a common language with their audiences, national central banks are essential in explaining ECB policies to the broader public in their countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">This communication with national audiences is also important given that economic conditions may at times diverge in different parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The national central banks are then well placed to correct the potential dissonance between the rationale of monetary policy actions tailored to the conditions of the euro area as a whole and those that national audiences may consider more appropriate for their own economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.77,0)">Explaining the common monetary policy stance in a national context is in practice a very challenging task, especially when countries are hit by asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Reflecting the increasing complexity of monetary policy The challenge for communication to preserve consistency, acceptance and trust across geographies is accompanied by another, no less intricate, challenge: ensuring consistency over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Central banks’ monetary policy instruments have undergone a sea change over the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.74,0)">The policy-controlled short-term interest rates of the ECB, the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan dropped from levels between 4% and 5% to essentially zero   in a relatively short space of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Since the beginning of the crisis, these central banks’ balance sheets have grown significantly above levels that for decades had been considered typical  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.3,0)">Figure 3: Key monetary policy interest rates   Sources: ECB, Federal Reserve, Bank of Japan and Bank of England.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.1,0)">Latest observation: 31 October 2017  , 6 November 2017   Figure 4: Central bank balance sheets   Source: ECB, Federal Reserve, Bank of England and Bank of Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.27,0)">Latest observation: 3 November 2017  , 27 October 2017   and 1 October 2017  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Such a profound change in policy conduct requires us to carefully explain that consistency does not mean constancy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Consistency means that we are faithful to our mandate and seek to deliver the monetary policy stance that, given the prevailing economic conditions, maximises our chances of attaining our objective over the policy-relevant horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Pursuing our mandate has entailed pronounced shifts in the frequency of policy changes and in the nature and composition of instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">What is important, however, is that these shifts are governed by a clear organising framework which:   centres on the ultimate objective, price stability for the ECB;   embeds a view on the monetary policy transmission mechanism that maps policy measures with the ultimate objective; and   yields a reaction function that determines how the monetary policy stance adjusts to changing economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">This organising framework provides a way for us to manage the difficult balancing act of responding to material changes in the outlook for price stability in a timely manner, while ensuring that there is sufficient evidence to justify our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The key economic rationale for monetary policy communication is to make this reaction function understood by markets and the broader public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It does so not only by announcing the prevailing policy but also by stating the reasons and detailing the assessments that led the central bank to adopt it, thereby allowing observers to more efficiently infer patterns than would be possible without such communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Moreover, in recent years, many central banks have gone a step further to make their reaction function more transparent and concrete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Communication on the prevailing policy and the thinking behind it has been complemented by guidance on the future policy course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.2,0)">In providing forward guidance on their main policy tools, central banks have specified the time period over which they expect or intend to preserve a certain instrument calibration and stipulated the contingencies that would warrant a change in instrument calibration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.71,0)">This innovation in the communication framework has directly served to signal consistency in policy conduct at a time when, first, proximity to the effective lower bound on policy-controlled short-term interest rates might have raised doubts as to the central bank’s options to deliver the requisite amount of monetary easing; and, second, the adoption of new, previously unknown, policy tools left observers without a clear historical reference point to gauge the central bank reaction function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Furthermore, especially in its outcome-based formulation, forward guidance has explicitly maintained the state contingency of policy conduct and established a clear link between the policy objective and the future evolution of policy tools – a consideration that also formed the backdrop for the Governing Council’s decision in October to reconfirm the outcome-based element of its forward guidance on the expanded asset purchase programme, which remains contingent on a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Overall, our forward guidance framework has left a clear imprint on the market’s ability to gauge our policy intentions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">One potential metric by which to measure the effectiveness of forward guidance on key ECB interest rates is the sensitivity of forward rates to macroeconomic news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In the presence of clear guidance on the policy rate path, forward rates which embed investors’ rate expectations should be less reactive – over short to medium-term horizons – to macroeconomic surprises and instead be anchored by central bank communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.77,0)">Observing this metric over time, it becomes clear that the introduction of our measures – including the forward guidance on policy rates – has been followed by a pronounced decline in the sensitivity of forward rates at the shorter end of the term structure, where monetary policy expectations have the biggest impact, while rates at the longer end have remained around their historical average  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.92,0)">Moreover, the more muted responsiveness that accompanied the introduction of the policy package in mid-2014 also went along with a pronounced flattening of the short to medium-term segment of the forward curve  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.69,0)">Figure 5: Time-varying sensitivity of the three-month OIS in two years’   and ten years’   time   Source: ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.67,0)">Estimation is based on Altavilla C., Giannone D. and

lines represent the associated confidence bands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">When larger   than one, the sensitivity is higher   than historical regularities.</span><span

.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.46,0)">Figure 6: Expectations of future short-term rates in the euro area in periods of ECB non-standard measures   Sources: Bloomberg and ECB calculations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.23,0)">We have been communicating about our asset purchase programme by disclosing two parameters: the pace of purchases per month, and a date by which the Governing Council could end the net purchases, provided we, by that date, see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation consistent with our inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">This combination of date-based and outcome-based forward guidance has made it easier for market participants to calculate the stimulus being provided each time our programme has been  calibrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The date-based element suggests the minimum amount of stimulus that the programme could be expected to deliver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The outcome-based element – very fundamentally – ties the programme to our inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.88,0)">Have market expectations internalised the state-contingent nature of our monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And which element has prevailed in shaping market expectations: the date-based or the inflation-contingent element?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.98,0)">Market expectations for the likeliest terminal date of the APP have not coincided with the “expiry date” communicated in the most recent programme recalibration, but have instead typically extended beyond this expiry date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In other words: in forming their predictions about the most likely date for purchases to end, markets have not just looked at the date-based element of our guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">They have also considered the outcome-based element, which allows for the possibility of a purchase horizon extending beyond the expiry date, if that is necessary to attain a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This, in turn, indicates that the state contingency of the APP has been well understood by market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Clarifying the interaction between monetary policy instruments In normal times, central banks adapted their monetary policy stance by influencing the level of one short-term interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.8,0)">In unconventional times, communication has had to cope with the new challenge of explaining the complementarities between policy tools, as non-standard monetary policy has become multidimensional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.77,0)">To ensure that their reaction function is understood, central banks have to explain how their policies take into account these essential complementarities in the transmission of the individual tools – although this may significantly increase the complexity of the messages they have to convey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In this context, it is perhaps no coincidence that the complexity of the introductory statements delivered at the ECB’s press conferences, as measured by common indices of text readability, has also increased, and started to do so just around the time when we began the latest round of non-standard measures in mid-2014  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.96,0)">Figure 7: ECB introductory statements – reading grade level   and number of words Source: ECB introductory statements .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Higher values on the scale indicate higher complexity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.42,0)">The higher the number of words, the larger the bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.79,0)">The curve plots the six-month moving average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.61,0)">The FK reading grade level is calculated using MS Word.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Latest observation: 26 October 2017 A multi-instrument policy toolkit is more complex because it adds a further dimension to the central bank reaction function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It not only has to map contingencies with modifications of the policy stance – it also needs to clarify which tool would provide the first margin of adjustment if a change in the policy stance were to appear warranted and how the adjustment in one policy instrument would interact with the others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This evolution in the policy toolkit has been fully reflected in the evolution of the ECB’s approach to forward guidance in the different phases of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Forward guidance on interest rates was first adopted in July 2013 as a means to insulate the euro area from the global financial turmoil that had followed the so-called taper tantrum episode a few weeks earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">This proved to be an effective firewall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">But the subdued inflation outlook, as well as other headwinds to the euro area recovery, stemming from, for instance, subdued bank credit, required a more comprehensive policy package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">So in the summer of 2014 we launched a complex package of policy measures that were to be adopted in a sequential and state-contingent manner as economic conditions evolved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Given the essential interaction between policy tools in their transmission to the economy, the ECB accompanied the expanded asset purchase programme that it announced in January 2015 with an adjustment to the forward guidance framework, moving from a previously singular focus on policy rates to a dual approach combining and integrating the different elements of guidance on policy rates and asset purchases  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Communication about the intended horizon of net asset purchases and the expected future path of policy rates has been a key component of our policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Our forward guidance on policy rates has acted as an enabling condition for the purchases to exert their full impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.2,0)">In the absence of reassurances that policy rates would remain anchored around levels close to their lower bound for the entire life of the net purchases, the downward impact of asset purchases on term premia could have been partly neutralised by expectations of rate increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">At the same time, the conditionality attached to the intended horizon and size of our net asset purchases has reinforced the signalling power of our forward guidance on rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Figure 8: Evolution of ECB forward guidance framework Looking ahead, as we progress towards a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation and approach the time when net purchases will gradually come to an end, the residual monetary support needed to assist the economy in its transition to a new normal will increasingly come from forward guidance on our policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Policy rates will eventually regain their status as the main instrument of policy, and our forward guidance will revert to a singular approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.24,0)">Conclusion Monetary policy communication faces several distinct challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">It has to be accessible to and useful for a variety of audiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">It has to be consistent in diverse economic circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And it has to clearly convey the central bank’s reaction function, also when the latter entails a diverse set of instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">To meet these challenges, the ECB’s communication uses a broad range of channels to express the Governing Council’s policy intentions at euro area level and to explain it to national audiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">It has made further efforts to make this reaction function understood by markets and the broader public, not least by providing detailed information on the thinking underlying its actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">And, in recent years, it has made its reaction function more transparent and concrete by adopting an integrated forward guidance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We will continue to engage with the general public and to guide market expectations as new challenges arise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This means that we have to continue reflecting and having constructive debates on how to shape central bank communication in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">I would like to thank Federic Holm-Hadulla for his support in the preparation of this speech.</span><span
