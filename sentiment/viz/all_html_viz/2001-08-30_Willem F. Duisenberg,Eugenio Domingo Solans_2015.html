    <span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)"> ECB Press conference on the occasion of the unveiling of the euro banknotes and their security features, Frankfurt am Main, 30 August 2001 Transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the ECB, and Prof. Dr. Eugenio Domingo Solans, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB Duisenberg: There is maybe a word to be said on the stars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These 12 stars are signed and dated by me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">They will be transported today to the 12 national central banks participating in European Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">They will henceforth be used by those national central banks in the complementary media campaigns which, in many countries, central banks or special fora, or central banks together with ministries of finance, are conducting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">That is where the stars will go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.58,0)">Question: Mr. Duisenberg, you have four months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It is clear from this press conference that you love the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.91,0)">But it would seem that most Europeans do not share your love for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">You have four months to convince them that they should love the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.17,0)">It is a huge uphill struggle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">How are you going to do it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">And are you convinced that you can do it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Duisenberg: I am convinced we can do it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We have started today, really.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">And I am sure that Europeans, and not only Europeans, will love the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And I can assure you that this entire campaign is not intended to sell the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.1,0)">As a central banker, I have the experience that I have never had any difficulty in getting rid of my product.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And that is also now the case here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Question: Mr. President, two questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Could you tell us more about the budget invested in the information campaign throughout Europe until the end of the year?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And, second point, a more technical question but probably not totally irrelevant: An owner of a US banknote of 1936 can use it today every time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.15,0)">What will be the validity of the euro banknotes which are issued on 1 January 2002?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Could we still use them in 100 years from now and could people stock them in safes for this reason?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Duisenberg: Yes, I hope people will not stock them, but use them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">But they will be able to use them 100 years from now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.04,0)">As you know, the process of monetary unification is an irreversible process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It is with us and it is with us to stay forever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The Eurosystem has so far devoted a budget of €80 million to the entire campaign, of which more than €30 million is devoted to the mass media campaign which has just been introduced by Mr. Domingo Solans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Well, I think these are about all the details you need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Question: I realise that you have great concerns about counterfeiting and preventing counterfeiters from getting a head start on the launch of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.87,0)">But now, as you move into the last phase, why is it that people will still not actually be able to hold the notes if tilting and feeling are two of the three essential aspects for becoming familiar with them?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.07,0)">And the other question I have is: why do you have a copyright?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.86,0)">Why do you need that?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Duisenberg: Could you answer the second question, Eugenio?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We thought one thing was important: that the euro comes into circulation simultaneously in the 12 countries and is available to whoever wants it in the other countries in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.54,0)">Then you have to select a date and have to produce the currency in time to be ready for that date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Now, as regards production, as I indicated earlier, we are still in the production process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In total we have ordered around 14.5 billion banknotes to date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.56,0)">We expect to have to issue between 9 and 10 billion of those 14.5 billion banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The rest are intended for what we call our logistical stocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And, of that total, as of 1 August 2001, I believe that about 10 billion were ready.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">So we need more time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.8,0)">And we also need time firstly to familiarise the public with the banknotes they are going to have and, therefore, this one session we have today is not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">But the campaign to familiarise the public with the banknotes, and especially their security features, is a process which will take some time before we, may I say, entrust the public with actually having the banknotes and with using them in a safe and prudent manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But what we will do from the day after tomorrow, for those who want them and are eligible to have them, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">credit institutions and retail organisations, is to start frontloading the banknotes to interested parties, provided they assure us either by law or by contract that they will not in turn issue the banknotes to the general public before 1 January next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But the process of delivery will start – I believe – in many, if not all countries on 1 September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Domingo Solans: It is now, at the very end of August, that we have produced exactly 11 billion banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">And we have co-ordinated production capacity of around 1 billion banknotes per month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">That means that at the very end of the year we will have more than the 14.5 billion banknotes we estimate to be the needs of the Eurosystem, both to replace the existing national banknotes and to build the logistical stocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.39,0)">Concerning the question relating to the control of the reproduction copyrights, etc., this is of course a legal question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This does not exactly relate to counterfeiting but, as the President mentioned, we have approved rules concerning the reproduction of banknotes in order to avoid any confusion and misunderstanding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">We think that the existence of the security features – which are really effective – will then avoid risks or reduce risks because a real risk of counterfeiting always exists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.47,0)">The copyright and the reproduction rules, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">will help just to be on the safe side on this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Question: President Duisenberg, you gave us a historical and really very moving speech, which is why I am asking you what the politicians have to do now for the next couple of years so that the challenge for this innovation for this new century can be mastered?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Duisenberg: We will continue to hammer and hammer and hammer on politics to go forward, especially in the interests of growth and employment in the euro area as a whole with the structural reforms that are so badly needed in many sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Question: Mr. Duisenberg, how are the citizens of the countries outside the euro zone going to learn about the euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">For instance, in Africa, there are countries that use the French franc or in eastern Europe the German Mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Duisenberg: Of the €80 million I mentioned, about 10% is destined for the international media campaign and close co-operation with the central banks outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">But part of the media campaign will also be executed through internationally well-known media.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">We have already had a question from CNN; I am sure that it will also be broadcast in Africa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Question: Firstly, is it correct that, for people who are very good at these things, you can actually feel the difference between banknotes produced in different countries because, for example, the German and French printing works use different printing processes and, secondly, when will the retail organisations and the banks who are taking the delivery of banknotes over the next few weeks actually be able to take some of them out of the packages in their vaults to use for training of their staff and their customers' staff?</span>
