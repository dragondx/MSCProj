    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.56,0)"> Frankfurt am Main, 18 December 2019 Monetary policy: lifting the veil of effectiveness Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ECB colloquium on “Monetary policy: the challenges ahead” held in his honour In a few days, I will leave the ECB after eight years of unprecedented challenges for the integrity and stability of our single currency, the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Throughout these years, the ECB’s resolve and steadiness have been the cornerstone of Europe’s crisis response and economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">I feel grateful and humbled to have been given a chance to be part of this effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">I would like to thank former President Mario Draghi, my Executive Board and Governing Council colleagues, and the staff of this great institution for their friendship and trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">And I would like to wish Isabel Schnabel and Fabio Panetta the best of luck.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.68,0)">The starting point for my remarks this morning is people’s sense of frustration and their criticism of central banks for failing to deliver inflation consistent with their aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.91,0)">This criticism has taken different forms in society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.84,0)">Professional observers and financial market participants often criticise the inadequate size of our actions and question the effectiveness of our instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.71,0)">Private citizens criticise the type of instruments we use – in particular asset purchases and negative interest rates – and the side effects they associate with them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.09,0)">The use of these instruments has caused persistent mistrust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">While three in four euro area citizens think the single currency is good for the European Union and two in three think it is good for their country, less than half of citizens trust the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In my remarks this morning, I would like to make two points that speak to these concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The first is that there is no contradiction between inflation being low and monetary policy being effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Central banks have achieved great success in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.74,0)">Their achievements, however, and this will be my second point, are of little avail if the public does not recognise or understand them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I will argue that this “veil of effectiveness” creates enormous challenges for the credibility and acceptance of central banks – challenges which can only be overcome by revisiting the appropriateness of four key components at the heart of our current monetary policy frameworks: how we define price stability, how we measure inflation, how we evaluate the credibility of our intentions and the range of counterparts through which we implement monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Low inflation and the effectiveness of monetary policy My first point – how to square low inflation with policy effectiveness – centres on two separate questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">How should we, the central banking community, evaluate the effectiveness of our own actions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.96,0)">And why, despite years of extraordinary policy support, is inflation remaining stubbornly low?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.92,0)">Evaluating our own actions is surprisingly difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There is no handbook, no checklist that we can use to consistently grade our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Ultimately, of course, there can only be one yardstick to measure central bank effectiveness: our track record in delivering inflation consistent with our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.16,0)">But does inflation failing to converge to our aim mechanically imply that our actions have not been effective?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">My answer is a clear “no”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Despite unprecedented challenges to monetary policy implementation, central banks have succeeded in delivering financial and monetary conditions that are exceptionally supportive of real economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.24,0)">Many euro area firms can currently borrow in financial markets at negative rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.28,0)">Bank lending rates, also for small and medium-sized firms, are currently at, or close to, historical lows, with little dispersion across major economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Firms have responded to these incentives as economic theory would predict.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Over the past five years, real investment has expanded at a faster pace than in the five years preceding the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">This is no small achievement considering the persistent uncertainty that has weighed on sentiment in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Investment, in turn, has boosted job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Employment is up by 7% compared with mid-2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">And in many euro area countries wages are growing at the fastest pace in many years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.23,0)">All in all, ECB staff estimates show that, without our policy actions, euro area real GDP would have been up to 2.7 percentage points lower at the end of last year, and inflation would have been up to half a percentage point lower every year over the past four years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Explaining low inflation Such counterfactuals – based on a wide range of models – are important proof that policy has been effective along the full chain of transmission – from financial market prices to economic activity and from the real side to the nominal side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.88,0)">For everything we know about how policy propagates through the economy, inflation today would be significantly weaker in the absence of our actions, maybe even dangerously close to deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.51,0)">But such counterfactuals are far too complex to lend true credibility to our actions outside of our narrow circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.58,0)">They still raise the question as to why policy support has failed to promote a more robust convergence of inflation to levels that would allow a normalisation of policy – that would allow graduating the instruments that have caused mistrust and concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">There are two broad hypotheses for why this might be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.68,0)">The first is that policy has been wrongly calibrated – that is, slack is larger than widely assumed, and policy should be even more accommodative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.07,0)">True, the output gap is an elusive concept that should never have become a gauge for conducting public policy, and it may be larger than thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.83,0)">And broader measures of unemployment that include, for example, involuntary part-time work remain well above headline unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.17,0)">But these measures are now no longer higher than they were before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.1,0)">I would also dismiss the assertion that the relationship between output and inflation has broken down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">A plethora of empirical studies prove that the Phillips curve is alive and well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.66,0)">The second, and in my view more plausible, explanation is that the Phillips curve has shifted inward over time – that is, inflation today may be lower at every level of the output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.81,0)">Such shifts typically relate to persistent and slow-moving changes on the supply side of our economies, where monetary policy has less traction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.63,0)">As such, they are difficult to detect, and even more difficult to prove, in particular when they coincide with weak aggregate demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.72,0)">But collectively their impact on wage and price inflation is difficult to dismiss.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Just consider the structural changes in global energy markets where the shale oil revolution has effectively put a ceiling on oil prices by increasing the responsiveness of oil supply to demand shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.75,0)">Think of the secular decline in wage bargaining power that contributed to a significant part of recent productivity gains no longer being distributed to labour, with adverse consequences for real disposable incomes, consumption growth and, ultimately, inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.66,0)">Or consider the salient impact of digitalisation on the pricing power of brick and mortar firms, which may have contributed, at least in part, to the recent decline in the pass-through of higher wage costs to consumer prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.32,0)">Add to these shocks the effects of ageing, the rise of services and the broader effects of globalisation and it is hard not to conclude that the combination of these shocks is likely to have put a lid on inflation in recent years, and that these shocks are likely to constrain price pressure also in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.72,0)">None of this is necessarily bad news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Many of these shocks are in fact benign, in the sense that they have the potential to ultimately lift productivity and real wages and pave the way to a low-carbon economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Central banks clearly need to step up their research and modelling capacities to understand their joint impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.64,0)">But until this happens – and the pace will depend a lot on our broader economic policy framework, which I won’t discuss this morning  – central banks are likely to have to navigate in a low-growth, low-inflation environment with the risk of repeatedly failing to deliver inflation in line with their aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Monetary policy in a low-inflation environment What, then, can, or should, central banks do in this environment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me propose four elements for future reflection: how we define price stability, how we treat inflation expectations, how we measure inflation and how we implement monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Some proposals are more far-reaching than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">But all share one aim: to bring monetary policy closer to the people – to dismantle the veil of effectiveness and to foster acceptance of policies and instruments that too often are used as scapegoat for shortcomings and deficiencies elsewhere in our public policy apparatus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.91,0)">Rethinking the definition of price stability Consider first the ECB’s definition of price stability as inflation rates of “below, but close to, 2%”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">A simple answer to the current challenges would be to lower the inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.62,0)">If my dissection of the current inflation drivers is vaguely on the right track, then it is clear that this strategy would be wrong on many levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.33,0)">It would misjudge the current low-inflation episode as permanent and thereby dismiss the lessons of history on the slow pace of diffusion of new technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.94,0)">It would create perilous time-consistency challenges for central banks when inflation eventually transitions to the new steady state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.73,0)">And it would shift a disproportionate share of the macroeconomic adjustment burden onto workers as, even more so than today, shocks to euro area economies would have to be accommodated by lowering nominal wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.27,0)">Not the best way to foster support for Europe and its single currency!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.62,0)">Raising the aim is similarly misguided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.8,0)">Why raise an aim that you have failed to achieve in the first place?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.98,0)">I come at this debate from a different angle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">If we communicate that we aim to maintain inflation at, say, 1.9%, then we should not be surprised if the public expects us to control inflation up to the first decimal point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">It significantly raises the bar for maintaining the credibility of monetary policy, particularly given how little the public actually knows about inflation and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.8,0)">We need to dismantle the absurd idea of an omnipotent central bank that can mechanically steer inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The ECB should clarify that it aims to deliver inflation of 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">And it could communicate the range of inflation outcomes that can be considered acceptable in normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.05,0)">Such a tolerance band, which can be more or less precise, is not an invitation for inaction or complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Research shows that central banks have a strong incentive to already respond to inflation deviations within the tolerance zone, rather than waiting until inflation has crossed the edges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.11,0)">And there is no convincing evidence that a tolerance band weakens the anchoring role of a midpoint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It rather recognises the large and inherent uncertainty surrounding price and wage decisions, conveys this uncertainty to the general public and its elected representatives and establishes consistency with the medium-term horizon of the ECB’s strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">For this change to be effective, however, two elements are critical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">First, the ECB would need to do more to communicate the midpoint to the broader public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.52,0)">A recent survey in the United States showed that only a quarter of respondent households knew of the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">And, second, the ECB would need to establish a clear track record that emphasises the centrality of the midpoint in the conduct of its policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The 2% needs to remain the clear nominal anchor for coordinating both expectations and actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.0,0)">Which inflation expectations matter?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The second element we should review relates to how we should evaluate expected deviations from the midpoint target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.08,0)">Critics would dismiss the idea of tolerance bands around the inflation aim because they fear that, by signalling our comfort with a range of inflation rates below 2%, we would entrench expectations of low inflation and risk downplaying the nominal anchor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I have two comments in response to these fears.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.55,0)">The first is that we can no longer ignore the fact that medium-term inflation expectations of both professional forecasters and financial market participants have persistently adjusted lower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Adaptive expectations are rational at times of deep structural change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.55,0)">My second comment is really more of a question: which expectations should central banks consider when evaluating risks to the inflation outlook?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Neither the academic community nor the central banking community have ever provided an answer to this question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.43,0)">I see a large gap between the role played by inflation expectations in our profession and the extent of central banks’ actual knowledge about how expectations ultimately affect inflation outcomes and which expectations are concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Market-based measures are convenient because they are readily available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.11,0)">But convenience may prove delusive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Household inflation expectations, for example, have been found to be a better proxy of firms’ pricing decisions than those of professional forecasters or financial market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.22,0)">But expectations by household have pointed in a very different direction in recent times, painting a much less dire picture regarding the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.21,0)">According to one survey, households believed that annual euro area inflation between 2004 and 2018 was close to 9%, when in fact it was 1.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.65,0)">Does the consumer price index need to be changed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The third element relates to the way we measure inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   has been a tremendous achievement in terms of providing a reliable, timely and comparable measure of consumer inflation across EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But whether it adequately captures the cost of living should be subject to regular review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.02,0)">A well-known example is the cost of housing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The HICP captures only marginally the largest single lifetime expenditure of households – their cost of housing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Housing costs currently enter the HICP mainly through actual rentals, with a weight of just 6.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The costs of owner-occupied housing, by contrast, are not included even though more than 65% of households in the euro area own their main residence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.3,0)">Careful reflection is warranted but allowing a wedge to persist between the inflation that households perceive and the rate we officially measure can undermine the validity of our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Rethinking central banks’ toolkit Re-evaluating the appropriateness of these three elements – the inflation aim, the role of inflation expectations and inflation measurement – would probably go a long way towards revitalising policy in line with the current challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.55,0)">But it may not be enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.48,0)">If the current environment of persistently low underlying inflation and elevated uncertainty were to persist well into the future – and there is a risk that it may – then the odds are large that firms and social partners will increasingly start adjusting prices and wages accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">In this case, more forceful policy action would be needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">One option would then be to do more of the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">I have no doubt that the ECB can further ease financing conditions by deploying its current instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">But one may doubt whether this approach would be more effective in bringing inflation closer to the aim than it has been so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">And one may wonder how far the depth of our shallow capital markets can be sounded, and whether the side effects of our measures would not outweigh the benefits at some point in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">A second possible, and complementary, option is to coordinate economic policies more closely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.44,0)">The combination of limited fiscal policy space in many euro area countries, political fixation on large fiscal surpluses in some, and the persistent opposition to a common fiscal capacity makes this option less credible, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.58,0)">Coordination with fiscal authorities cannot be a fig leaf for central bank inaction or inability to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.72,0)">And it can easily degenerate into a threat to central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">But central banks have one key strength, and that is their agility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">They have always been able to reinvent themselves, to innovate and overcome even severe impediments to transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And if transmission through financial markets and banks hits a wall – if the third stage of transmission remains anaemic – then central banks have the obvious choice of considering whether to broaden the set of counterparties through which they implement monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The discussion about central bank digital currencies is a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">At the heart of this discussion is the question of whether central banks should grant the general public direct access to their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.13,0)">This question comes with many thorny technological choices and policy challenges, in particular with regard to financial stability and the future of credit intermediation, as we know.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.7,0)">But assuming that these challenges can be overcome, then there are few reasons why central banks, within their mandate, should not apply the same set of instruments to accounts of private individuals that they currently apply to banks – that is, charge interest rates on central bank digital money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">By going to the heart of consumer choices, this approach would likely be more effective and faster in stimulating demand and inflation, and it could have less negative side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.7,0)">Rather than addressing the symptoms of low inflation, this would amount to precision surgery on the Euler equation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">None of this is to say that it would be trivial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Ultimately, central banks would need to weigh the costs against the benefits – just like we did for other unconventional policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.26,0)">What we should avoid, however, is restricting our toolkit for dogmatic reasons or intellectual convenience, and giving up on our ability to deliver on our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.74,0)">If monetary policy remains a conversation between central banks and financial markets, we shouldn’t be surprised if people don’t trust us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.79,0)">Too many see us as part of a financial system which has failed to deliver growth and fairness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.3,0)">And this also curtails our policy options.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Technological progress will continue to transform monetary policy in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.73,0)">To what extent and in what ways will depend both on the preferences of society and the risks that a very protracted period of low inflation poses to macroeconomic and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">There will be evolutionary changes that will ensure that current and tested policy frameworks remain fit for purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">These changes may include progress on how we measure inflation and the evolving consensus on how we define price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And there will be revolutionary changes, similar in scale and scope to the shift from banknotes to bank deposits a few centuries ago or the recent adoption of negative interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Technology will create new policy choices and options enabling central banks to continue acting within their mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">As Mario Draghi said at his last press conference: “Never give up!” I wish Christine Lagarde and her team the best of luck and I fully trust that they will find the wisdom and courage to act in the face of ever changing conditions, as the ECB has always done in its history.</span>
