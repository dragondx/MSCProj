    <h1> The Future of the International Monetary System </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, The Golden Series lecture at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum (OMFIF), London, 23 November 2011 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Vítor Constâncio </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)"> The Future of the International Monetary System Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, The Golden Series lecture at the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum  ,London, 23 November 2011 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is with pleasure that I have accepted the invitation from the OMFIF Golden Series on World Money to talk about the future of the international monetary system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">This subject has become very topical this year, not least in view of the discussions and progress achieved at the very recent Cannes Summit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.16,0)">I will start by briefly recalling the key features of a good international monetary system and on this basis, I will try to define what are, in my view, the main weaknesses of the present system  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.51,0)">This will allow me to dwell upon the possible evolution over the medium run of some of the main components of the international monetary system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">When concluding, I will assess whether such an evolution may prove to be an adequate response to the challenges we are confronted with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">What can we expect from a good-quality international monetary system?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The ultimate goal of the international monetary system   is to maintain an orderly system of payments among nations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">To this aim, the IMS has to provide the services of an international currency, ensure adequate creation of global liquidity, define an exchange rate regime among national currencies and include an adjustment mechanism to avoid excessive external real and financial imbalances across nations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Both global liquidity and the adjustment mechanism can be interpreted as global public goods  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It is indeed only through access to global liquidity that it becomes possible to participate in, and finance, the global economy by using one or more reserve currencies as a means of payment, a unit of account or a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">And it is only through an efficient and effective adjustment mechanism that it becomes possible to benefit from “external stability”, namely a global sustainable constellation of cross-country economic linkages  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.14,0)">Once external stability is achieved, cross-country linkages do not give rise to disruptive developments, such as disorderly exchange rate and asset price swings or contractions in real output and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">External stability crucially depends on the policy behaviour of those issuers and holders of international currencies that are systemically relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The exchange rate and capital flow regimes are probably the core elements of the adjustment mechanism, since they define the degree of flexibility of each IMS, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">its adaptability to changing economic circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">In contrast to the Bretton Woods system with fixed exchanges rates, semi-closed capital accounts and a strict adjustment mechanism, an IMS such as the present one enjoys a much higher degree of adaptability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Each country is free to choose its exchange rate and capital account regime, and the reserve-issuing countries face no IMS-embedded limits to the creation of global liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.58,0)">This is a fundamental strength of today’s system, but it may also become – as we will see – a major weakness to the extent that it creates scope for unsustainable domestic growth models and the ensuing accumulation of real and financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.09,0)">What are the shortcomings of the present “non-system” Besides the persistent external imbalances, there are many other shortcomings being mentioned about the present “non-system”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.74,0)">I can mention a few of them: abrupt reversal of capital flows; systematic inflows going from emerging to developed countries; inefficient accumulation of reserves by emerging countries; excessive exchange rate volatility ineffective to ensure external balance; asymmetry of adjustment pressure between deficit and surplus countries; absence of mechanisms to ensure the sufficient and timely supply of global liquidity in times of financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This list means that, potentially, all the features of an IMS can be at stake in the present discussion, contrary to what happened in the late nineties when the discussion revolved around the functioning of the financial sector and the crisis prevention and resolution in emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The debate then was not about the reform of the IMS but rather about a new Global Financial Architecture, meaning the international framework for safeguarding and ensuring the efficient functioning of the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Today, after the start of the crisis in 2007, the issues under discussion are at the core of what constitutes an International Monetary System: 1) Are new international currencies necessary and/or unavoidable in the present circumstances?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">2) Should changes be introduced in the foreign exchange regime?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">3) Does the system need new and stronger instruments of liquidity provision, especially in times of financial crises?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">4) What changes should be introduced in the adjustment mechanism?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">5) Which reforms are needed in the about international regulation of the financial sector?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.83,0)">I will not address this last point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Regarding the second issue on the exchange rate regime, I will only mention that I see no justification to change the floating regime among the major currencies or to modify the recommendation that big emerging economies should also adopt much more flexible rate regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.42,0)">This means that in the conflict characterised by MacKinnon   between the international adjustment view of exchange rates and the monetary standard view, I take the side of the former.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.03,0)">Also, the present situation of financial globalisation confirms the early "bipolar view" of Alexander Swoboda that with high capital mobility the only stable exchange rate regimes are floating rates or hard pegs, of which monetary unions are an extreme example  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Towards an unavoidable, but desirable, multi-polar IMS?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">There are many predictions about the gradual addition of other currencies to the dollar as truly international currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.64,0)">What seems to make this unavoidable it is not only the emergence of the euro, the increasing strength of China or the growing vulnerabilities of the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The growth in importance of emerging countries, that have seen their share in the world GDP augmented by 15 percentage points in the last 20 years, creates a structural increase for the demand of reserves that the developed countries, including the USA, will not be in a position to supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.22,0)">This question is linked with the problem of the provision of official international liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.69,0)">As Maurice Obstfeld   has recently recalled, there is a fiscal dimension to the supply of official reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">No single country in the world could indefinitely offer its currency as the reserve asset that could satisfy all the needs of a growing rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In the present circumstances where deficit and debt ratios need to be decreased, the US could not offer its bonds and T-bills as the almost exclusive reserve asset of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In this context, Euro assets are necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Even if they are clearly seen as an unrealistic prospect, Eurobonds, from the pure perspective of the International Monetary System, would be useful as a reserve asset for the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In the future, the system will also need assets in the Chinese currency, when China will have a convertible currency, a flexible exchange rate and a developed bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">All this implies that one possible scenario is the evolution towards a truly multi-polar IMS, which, as many have recently observed, would produce credible alternatives to dollar-denominated investments, thereby enhancing policy discipline in the core reserve issuer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Also, a multi-currency world would imply greater monetary policy autonomy in emerging economies such as China, which would thus be in a better position to tackle its own imbalances  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">There are five key conditions for a currency to become a major international currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">The first one is having a very large economy, which engenders network externalities and lowers transaction costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The second is given by deep, efficient and open financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Third, good political and macroeconomic governance is of course of the essence to preserve the external value of a currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Fourth, full enforcement of the rule of law is equally crucial as it ensures the protection of investors’ property rights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Fifth, one should not overlook the importance of geopolitical influence and political stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It is therefore not easy for a currency to fill all the conditions necessary for it to have an international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Consequently, I do not think that we will see a major change in the role of the US dollar over the next 10-15 years – though the conclusion may well be different over a longer horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The appearance of the euro as a new globally important currency has not produced a shift to a genuine duopoly in the supply of international currencies, and had little impact on the dollar’s centrality in the IMS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">We are likely to see the shares of other currencies growing over time, but it is unlikely that there will be just one currency replacing the US dollar’s hegemony.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The euro has established itself as the second most important international currency after the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">At the same time, this role is predominantly regional in nature, since the euro is mainly used by economic agents resident in euro area neighbouring countries with special political and economic ties to the European Union and the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">More recently, it is known that Asian investors and foreign central banks accounted for a sizable share of the demand for bonds issued by the European Financial Stability Facility  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Looking ahead, the share of the euro in international markets has the potential to rise further once financial stability and market integration is restored in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.55,0)">The ongoing efforts to improve the governance of the euro area and provide it with a credible crisis resolution mechanism will also indirectly affect the international use of the euro, even if the ECB and the Eurosystem do not take any initiatives to directly promote its use  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This neutral stance – neither foster nor hinder – is based on our conviction that the international use of currencies should be a by-product of autonomous market decisions driven by the aforementioned five determinants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Turning to the Chinese renminbi , one can observe that the use of the renminbi as an international currency has remained limited although China is now the third largest economy   and second largest exporter   of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The Chinese authorities have launched several initiatives since March 2009 to promote a wider international use of the renminbi, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">in trade invoicing, in deepening the role of the offshore centre played by Hong Kong S.A.R., or in agreeing local currency swap agreements with several central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Nevertheless, the full potential of the renminbi can ultimately only be achieved with the liberalisation of the capital account, accompanied by the reform of domestic financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Once these will be in place, a major internationalisation of the renminbi will happen as a by-product.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">For the time being, Chinese authorities seem to be trying to prudently promote financial liberalization via experimenting with market-driven renminbi securities in Hong Kong S.A.R..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.7,0)">But this comes at the expense of increasing exposure to capital flows which poses challenges for the macro-prudential set-up, especially given the current undervaluation of the renminbi.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.43,0)">Hence, Chinese authorities may also slow down the use of the renminbi abroad should tensions for domestic policy makers mount.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">All in all, the potential for the renminbi to upgrade as an international currency is clearly huge, but the timing is difficult to predict.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.18,0)">The necessary reform of the adjustment mechanism I share Kregel’s   view that “the basic problem   is not the particular national liability that serves as the international currency, but the failure of an efficient adjustment mechanism for global imbalances”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.68,0)">Indeed, one needs only to look at the problem of global payment imbalances to find weaknesses of the current IMS, or rather “non-system”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.48,0)">The build up of increasingly large current account surpluses in some export-oriented economies, which rely on a growth-model based on over-savings, was, in conjunction with accumulating deficits in a number of consumption-driven economies, a major source of concern in the years which preceded the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.69,0)">Such imbalances were coupled with “twin gluts” in global liquidity and planned savings which led to historically low risk premia – the main symptom that systemic risk was escalating in the presence of easy finance accommodating complacent borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Even the global financial crisis and the policy responses have reduced the imbalances only partly and temporarily over the most recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.08,0)">The fact that these imbalances have persisted for so long exposes a key weakness of the system, namely the inadequacy of the adjustment mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.28,0)">Let me explain this in more detail by looking at the various stakeholders: National authorities in deficit and surplus countries had little incentives to depart from their growth model and policy course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.2,0)">Indeed, prior to the crisis the economies with the largest external imbalances were often outperforming their peers in terms of GDP growth: the larger the imbalance, the higher was the growth rate over the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Moreover, the deficit and surplus countries, rather than exerting policy discipline on each other, in fact accommodated the other in the pursuit of their respective growth models  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.17,0)">Market discipline also proved partly unreliable for a number of reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.77,0)">Firstly, markets frequently do not function in line with fundamentals as expected, leading to mispricing and undue volatility in, for example, exchange rates and credit risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This may be explained in part by factors such as herding behaviour, but also the lack of a shared view on the relevant fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.18,0)">Secondly, market behaviour has also been constrained by structural factors and policy regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">On the deficit side, the fact that the United States provides the deepest and most liquid financial market - and issues the dominant reserve currency - provides it with an unparalleled platform to offer “safe” debt instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.51,0)">The insatiable demand for such debt instruments puts strong pressure on the US financial system and its incentives  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">At the same time, the US derives its “exorbitant privilege” from this situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The demand for US assets constrains the growth in credit and exchange rate risk premia charged by markets on rising US debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">This effectively limits the increase in external borrowing costs, thus removing an incentive to curb borrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.13,0)">On the surplus side, the semi-fixed exchange rate regimes and the semi-closed capital account of some major surplus countries prevent markets from exerting excessive pressure on capital flows or the exchange rate of such countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Thirdly, accommodated by a trend towards self-regulation, financial markets encouraged rather than tamed excessive borrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.72,0)">Income constraints on debt accumulation were circumvented through innovative debt instruments, which were insufficiently checked by quality credit analysis and internal controls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Moreover, in the search for yield and diversification, capital flows to emerging markets and “carry trade economies” have surged, prompting, in certain cases, the imposition of capital controls to limit the potentially disruptive influences of both excess inflows and their reversals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The international community has a role to play in exerting pressure on countries to adjust, primarily the International Monetary Fund   and the G20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Although helpful policy recommendations have been put forward at the global level, the traction gained by the international community has often not been as strong as it needed to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.91,0)">The IMF, to some extent, has been hampered in its efforts to ensure the stability of the IMS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.51,0)">The existing rules were designed for the pre-globalisation era and the enforcement mechanisms are not sufficiently effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Regarding the rules, these were agreed in an era of fixed exchange rates, closed capital accounts and highly regulated financial markets when the financial sector was the handmaiden of the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This was well before the widespread liberalisation of trade, financial markets and capital accounts that defines globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For example, under the IMF Articles of Agreement, members are free to pursue capital account regimes and exchange rate regimes of their choice, with only limited constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.51,0)">The outcome is a global constellation of exchange rate regimes that does not ensure sustained economic, financial and monetary stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.09,0)">The peg of currencies of a number of emerging economies to the US dollar creates a symbiosis that fosters ever larger imbalances and hence risks of disorderly adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.31,0)">Particularly when one of the emerging economies is very large, the pegging of its currency to another risks limiting the flexibility of adjustment in both, which in turn threatens to distort the exchange rate of other major currency pairs, with implications for global economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Turning to the enforcement mechanisms, surveillance and peer policy review have an essential role to play in identifying risks and encouraging remedial policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.49,0)">But international pressure – including via the IMF and the G20 – still suffers from lack of grip.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Even when risks are correctly identified and policy recommendations are appropriate, as it happened during IMF’s multilateral consultations in 2006-07, there is no guarantee of necessary policy adjustments being made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.87,0)">This remains the weakest aspect of the surveillance process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The crisis has led to increased efforts to improve surveillance, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">with the transformation of the Financial Stability Forum into the Financial Stability Board   with an enlarged membership and broadened mandate, changes inside the IMF, and the launching of the G20 Framework for Strong, Sustainable, and Balanced Growth and its Mutual Assessment Process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">There is a general recognition of the need to strengthen the multilateral angle of surveillance, to better encompass interlinkages and spillover effects, and to better integrate macroeconomic and financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">More work needs to be done, however, to further strengthen the effectiveness of surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.91,0)">There is no widespread consensus yet on how a country’s policies impact on other countries and – more importantly – no willingness of countries to submit themselves to closer scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">By contrast, we can observe a lot of mutual finger-pointing, mainly between advanced and emerging economies, but to some extent also within the two groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">It follows that EMEs push for an inclusion of global liquidity and its drivers into multilateral surveillance, whereas advanced countries see a need for more scrutiny of reserve accumulation practices, exchange rate policies and capital controls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.31,0)">Against this background, it is also obvious that a lot of countries do not have any appetite to change the IMF’s Articles of Agreement to ratify a broadening and strengthening of surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.09,0)">What can be done in such circumstances?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">I think that first of all we need to work even harder to achieve a better understanding of interlinkages and spillover effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This implies the need for more and better analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The new pilot spillover reports that the IMF started this year with a handful of systemically important countries are one welcome step in that direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Further research on the impact of policies in systemically important economies on global liquidity conditions and on capital flows will also help framing the discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Going forward, better awareness, a certain spirit of multilateralism and, last but not least, improved mechanisms to foster traction of policy advice will be crucial elements to strengthen the effectiveness of surveillance in contributing to global stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.94,0)">Evolution of global official liquidity Another area in which views are very much divided is the debate about the enhancement of official liquidity provision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">One idea is to strength the so-called global financial safety net  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">It would be used in those exceptional situations when countries with sound fundamentals suffer from financial market disruptions – such as foreign currency liquidity shortages or sudden stops in capital inflows – caused by contagion from major   external shocks Also here significant progress has been achieved over the last years: IMF resources have been tripled compared to 2008, access rights to IMF financing increased, and new facilities were created.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.04,0)">But some believe that this is not enough, and argue with pertinent arguments, that further enhancing the global financial safety net would provide incentives for countries to decrease their reserve holdings  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, as I mentioned earlier, the accumulation of large stocks of reserves is not only based on precautionary motives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.52,0)">Even the most customer-friendly IMF facilities might not lead countries to lower their reserves since they offer a higher level of comfort and convenience than IMF facilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.43,0)">At the same time, countries might face problems in actually using their reserves in times of crisis, given that markets might not focus on the absolute level, but rather on the relative changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Further reforms of the Fund’s toolkit need to be based on a thorough assessment of the experience with the existing tools and the resource implications further insurance-type facilities would have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The call for increased Fund resources, which is recently being voiced again, has also to be assessed carefully in light of existing and potential demand for Fund support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Concerning another SDR allocation, one should consider that during the recent crisis only a very small amount of SDRs allocated in 2009 has actually been converted into usable currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">What would seem to be justified is to foresee established mechanisms to provide liquidity in times of financial crises when private liquidity suddenly disappears.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">In this context there have been also calls on central banks to establish a permanent scheme of swap lines to help countries in times of systemic stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.06,0)">However, while central banks will certainly continue to assume their responsibilities in times of distress, they cannot commit ex-ante to any significant provision of liquidity as this could interfere with their mandate and create moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.21,0)">Concluding remarks: Is this enough?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Will the changes in the IMS which, based on current information, we are likely to witness over the next ten-fifteen years be sufficient to make it resilient and sustainable?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.06,0)">I am certainly not among those who consider that this is the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But then, what further changes are indispensable?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The answer to this question depends upon the longer-term vision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">If we are really heading towards a multi-polar system, this may well set stronger incentives for policy discipline, since the exorbitant privilege will be more widely shared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But will the road towards the new multi-polar system be smooth or very bumpy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Well, a lot will depend on the path of further financial market development, capital account liberalisation and exchange rate flexibility in EMEs, since this will progressively reduce the demand for safe debt instruments issued by advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">It will also allow a better channelling of domestic credit to investment and consumption, which in turn will help to promote growth driven by domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">And a lot will obviously also depend on the ability of advanced economies, starting with the euro area, to learn the appropriate lessons from the current sovereign debt and banking crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The speed and scope of this process will depend on decisions of policy makers and market participants in the various parts of this world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">If this whole process will be resolute and gradual at the same time, it should allow for an orderly transition towards a multi-polar IMS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Another question is whether the new IMS would be steady in nature or whether a new hegemon would emerge possibly to accomplish the “hegemonic stability theory” promoted by Kindleberger  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.33,0)">The answer will, again, depend predominantly on policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">It remains to be seen whether the currency competitors of such a multi-polar world will be of relatively close weight, both in economic and financial terms, but also with respect to the political and governance factors discussed before when considering the preconditions for a currency to become a major international currency.</span><span style="background-color:
