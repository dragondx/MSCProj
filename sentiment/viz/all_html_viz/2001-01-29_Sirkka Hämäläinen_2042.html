    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> Is the New Economy really new?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Ms Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Jaakko Honko Lecture, Helsinki School of Economics, 29 January 2001 Introduction Speculation about drastic and deep transformations has always been popular in the history of economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.0,0)">There are many examples of predictions of the imminent demise of well established economic patterns, such as business cycles or inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.73,0)">A statement made by Irving Fisher on the eve of the stock market crash in 1929 is a good example in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">He said: "We are living in a new era, and it is of the utmost importance for every businessman and every banker to understand this new era and its implications" and went on to add that "stock prices have reached what looks like a permanently high plateau".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">History shows that there are indeed reasons to be cautious with these kinds of prediction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.14,0)">For a few years now, we have been confronted with a new type of speculation about the death of the "Old Economy" and the arrival of a "New Economy".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This has been triggered by the undeniable fact that the overall performance of, in particular, the US economy over the past five to six years has been exceptionally good, as reflected in improved productivity growth, high GDP growth, stable inflation and low unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The changed face of the US economy, relative to the rather recent past, cannot be denied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.42,0)">Contrary to the experience of the 1970s, the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, the present historically low unemployment rate has not been sparking an acceleration of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The growth rates have exceeded the previously estimated potential growth without leading to an acceleration of inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Despite the rather short period of positive experience, speculation of a very long-lasting or even permanent change to productivity and potential growth appeared to underpin unrealistic expectations for a continuous positive development of future corporate earnings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.03,0)">The recent dampening of the activity in the US economy has contributed to a reassessment of these expectations, leading to a downward correction of stock prices, particularly in the so- called new economy sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">At the same time, the focus of attention has gradually been shifting away from the United States to Europe .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Whereas, in recent years, the discussion has centred on why the economic developments in Europe have been weaker than those of the United States , growing attention is now being paid to signs that the positive developments experienced in the United States may also be catching on in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.76,0)">Clearly, the central bank cannot be just a passive onlooker in this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">How it judges and reacts to these developments can have a significant bearing on the outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The central bank, of course, witnesses how new technology is deployed and may also see an acceleration in the growth rate of productivity and output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.12,0)">What is problematic is inferring at an early stage whether the potential growth rate is permanently raised or whether the development is due to employment and output changes associated with the business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Let me confess that, personally, I do not particularly like the term "New Economy" since it seems to indicate that we are now experiencing developments totally different from what we have seen before, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.44,0)">affecting basic economic rules and destroying existing structures in society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">The development of technology may have important effects on economic developments by enhancing efficiency, leading to changes in relative prices in the economy and thereby affecting the incentives and organisational behaviour of individuals and companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But new technology does not change basic economic laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In my presentation today, I will discuss various aspects of the recent economic developments which are commonly associated with the discussion on the new economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">First, I will discuss what is meant by the concept of the new economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Then, I will discuss the dilemmas it raises for central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">I will also look at what lessons can be drawn from history by comparing recent developments with the similarities and differences of earlier phases of technological change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Furthermore, I will try to assess why the euro area seems to be lagging behind the United States as regards the new economy effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Finally, I will draw some conclusions for the ECB's monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What is meant by the concept of the new economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is important that, before entering into any discussion on the impact of the new economy, there is agreement on the meaning of this concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.99,0)">When following the popular media, there seems to be some confusion surrounding the definition of the concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Sometimes, I have the feeling that any development in society which is even remotely related to the use of information technology, and the internet in particular, is regarded as a sign of a new economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.94,0)">In economic literature, there are two types of definition of the concept of new economy: a narrow one which refers specifically to the technological developments that are supposedly enabling an improved economic performance and a broader one that refers to behavioural characteristics of the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">There seems to be a growing understanding of the broader definition and of its scope, which implies that the concept of new economy entails much more than just the application of new information and communication technologies; attention is instead focused on three features of the aggregate economy which signal that an important change in the functioning of the economy has occurred: whether the potential growth rate of the economy has been permanently - or long- lastingly - raised  , predominantly as a result of technological developments and its contribution to improved profitability and increased investment; whether a permanent or long-lasting reduction in structural and frictional unemployment has occurred; whether a permanent or long-lasting reduction in the variation in the growth rate of output has occurred in general, and in particular, as a result of a fall in the ratio of inventories to production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.79,0)">In this context, I would like to point out that the term "long-lasting" is intended to mean a period of time measured in decade , not years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">A definition of the new economy based on these features could, in plain words, be described as an economy where the non-inflationary speed limit has increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In order to understand the broad concept, it is important to analyse the enabling factors behind such a process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In the discussion within the ECB and the Eurosystem, we have summarised the enabling factors for the new economy within five categories: First, there are the direct effects of advances in digital technology in the field of information and communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.55,0)">There are plenty of such direct effects which in one way or another affect all sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">For example, increasingly powerful computers enable firms to process information more efficiently and at lower costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">This has helped to revolutionise almost all the activities of firms in the manufacturing industry as well as in the services sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.76,0)">It affects product development, the purchasing of input material, the production process, accounting, inventory management, marketing, sales and customer relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Another obvious example is that information technology, particularly the internet, enables everybody to access almost unlimited information - produced and stored throughout the world - at negligible cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">And wireless communication increases people's flexibility - at work and in their free time - by enabling them to remain reachable and connected even outside their office or home.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Second, the globalisation of trade in goods and services and the increased product market competition are important factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Trade liberalisation contributes to an increasing degree of competition and reduces inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">It also contributes to improved factor productivity through a global reorganisation and specialisation of production according to absolute and comparative advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In Europe , the establishment of a Single Market for goods and services in the European Union has been particularly important in improving the cross-border competition in many sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Third, financial market liberalisation and the globalisation of financial markets contribute to a reduction in the costs of financial transactions and a more efficient intermediation of savings and investments, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">a more efficient resource allocation in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The development of new financial instruments in wider and deeper markets improves the possibilities for the private sector to manage risks more efficiently, and thereby enhances the ability of the economy as a whole better to withstand shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.53,0)">Fourth, reduced regulations and increasing flexibility in labour markets are important factors in bringing down structural unemployment and in preventing increased economic activity from being hampered by bottlenecks in the labour market and the resulting wage inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, the degree of labour market flexibility depends not only on regulations and the design of social welfare systems, but also very much on education, demography, national and regional traditions, overall mentality and attitudes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Fifth, prudent and stable macroeconomic policy orientation in monetary, fiscal as well as in structural policies is essential in establishing an economic environment conducive to investment and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">These five categories of enabling factors are - even if they are, as such, largely distinct from one another - linked through complex synergies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">For example, the development since the 1970s towards financial market liberalisation and integration has clearly been underpinned by the development of information technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The possibility to compare prices continuously and move funds instantaneously almost anywhere in the world has made it easy to circumvent domestic regulations, making it necessary for policy-makers to speed up the processes of deregulation and integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Liberalisation and integration of financial markets are, in turn, particularly beneficial for the financing possibilities of young, innovative and risky firms which have had difficulties in attracting funding in the traditional financial system dominated by bank intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">These kinds of "growth companies" have, in particular, been at the forefront of the information technology-based development in many sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The interaction between technological development and deregulation of the financial sector results in a self-sustained virtuous circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Another example of synergies between the enabling factors is that, on the one hand, stability-oriented economic policies, and in particular price stability, support investment activity and facilitate the rapid adoption of new technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">On the other hand, the technological developments are helpful in curbing inflationary pressures, through direct as well as indirect channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The direct price effects of innovation come via more efficient production at lower costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.86,0)">One example is the rapid decline in the costs of computer processing and communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But the indirect effects are important too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Efficient, low-cost information technology enables companies and consumers to find and compare information on quality and prices and thus contributes to increased competitive pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.3,0)">The conceptual framework typically employed by economists when trying to understand the mechanisms by which technological innovation has an impact on growth and productivity is the so-called growth accounting framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">This framework is based on the assumption of two production factors, namely capital and labour, and growth being derived from productivity improvements in the use of these factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">However, to understand the synergies of the enabling factors for a possible new economy, one must go beyond the growth accounting framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In fact, the productivity improvement cannot be explained solely on the basis of measured factors of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Rather, part of observed output growth is assigned to a combination of factors, called multi-factor productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Multi-factor productivity captures a wide variety of phenomena, including improvements in managerial procedures and working practices, improved production flows and better resource allocation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.06,0)">The effects of these phenomena are very difficult to quantify.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Although difficult to quantify, there is little doubt that all of the five categories of enabling factors which I mentioned contribute to improvements in multi-factor productivity - not just the technological developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Multi-factor productivity is typically attributed to the efficiency gains achievable through the reorganisation of the structure of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">There is therefore an argument for devoting special attention to multi-factor productivity in the case of innovations that have a pervasive effect throughout the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">During the First Industrial Revolution  , the steam engine and the railway were such innovations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">As for the Second Industrial Revolution  , the telegraph and, in particular, electricity could qualify as innovations with a pervasive effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Information technology, and especially the internet, is similar to electricity in its pan- economy effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.31,0)">It affects the behaviour and organisation of all layers in the production chain throughout all business sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Whereas the major impact of many of the previous "revolutions" was on the physical production environment, information technology together with the other enabling factors of the new economy change the intangible environment in the whole society and particularly in the services industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">It is evident that the most important productivity gains are achieved when the information technology is applied in the "old economy".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is one important reason why the new economy terminology may be misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Dilemmas for central banks The gradual emergence of new economy effects poses interesting challenges for central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">It is likely that these effects will lead to a faster upward turn in economic activity and productivity over a prolonged period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.78,0)">However, contrary to what is sometimes claimed in public debate, it is very unlikely - and indeed against historical evidence - that the effects will be of a permanent nature, defying the business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.08,0)">They may, however, - as they gradually progress - lead to a protracted upturn, which temporarily complicates the traditional business cycle analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.48,0)">Since forward-looking behavioural analysis must by definition to a large extent rely on the experience of historical relationships, innovations and major changes in the other enabling factors for growth naturally lead to increased uncertainty about future developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.97,0)">This is a challenge confronting all policy-makers in the context of the new economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.44,0)">Monetary policy-makers face increased uncertainty particularly as to the potential output - or the non-inflationary speed limit - of the economy Increased uncertainty about the growth rate of trend output unambiguously requires a more cautious attitude regarding monetary policy decisions based on this concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.36,0)">There are many aspects of this uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.19,0)">It is impossible for the central bank to know in the short term whether - and to what extent - the type of performance that we have seen in the United States in recent years reflects a permanent change in the functioning of the economy or whether it is a longer than usual but still transitory phenomenon, or only a short-term cyclical one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There is considerable uncertainty as to the magnitude, timing and path of the effects of new technology and its synergies with other enabling factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">A technology's full potential may be realised only after extensive improvements, or after complementary innovations in other areas of science.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">It is likely that the substantial economic effect of an innovation can only be derived when it has reached a wide penetration among the population and across various sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.45,0)">This is particularly true for network technologies; there was not much economic value in the internet as long as it was not widely used and only limited services were provided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.57,0)">The difficulties in predicting the impact of third-generation mobile telephones and mobile internet services are typical examples of this problem, where the speed of acceptance of the new technology is essential, first, for investors, technology producers and service providers estimating the expected earnings in view of potentially huge initial investment costs and, second, for the assessment of the overall economic benefits of the new services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.98,0)">The central bank is very much bound by the fact that knowledge of what is happening is not much better than what is reflected in the available statistical data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">It is important to detect signals of increased productivity at an early stage, but they do not necessarily show up in the data which are used in the formulation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.11,0)">There are many examples of how official data obviously underestimate productivity gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.58,0)">For example, official statistics indicate that total-factor productivity in the United States ' healthcare sector has fallen by 40% since 1960.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">But there is little doubt that medical care is much better today than 40 years ago, not least because more diseases can be cured and indicators show that people live longer and have more healthy years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">However, these factors are not easily captured in macro-economic statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.3,0)">Another example relates to the estimates of the volume of investment in information technology, which varies dramatically depending on the computational method chosen, such as whether hedonic or non-hedonic pricing is applied and the rate of depreciation assumed for the capital stock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Hedonic pricing, as employed in most statistics in the United States but to a far lesser extent in Europe , attaches a price to each individual quality characteristic of a product.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The application of hedonic pricing leads naturally, in the case of rapidly developing technologies, to a much more favourable decomposition of the nominal value of the product between volume and price than non-hedonic pricing methods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">This gives overall a more favourable view of both output growth and inflation in the United States than in most European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Applying the US method to Germany, the Bundesbank has come up with the result that German IT investment in 1998 amounted to more than twice the amount of real investment cited in official statistics, with an even bigger divergence in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Estimations carried out by the ECB show that the cumulative growth in computer investment in 1993-98 would have been four times as high in Germany and three times as high in the Netherlands if hedonic price indices had been used instead of the current national deflators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This would have implied that that the national accounts show much higher investment than the existing data; in Germany, non-residential private investment would have been twice as high and in the Netherlands 50% higher than what was recorded in the official national account statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Central banks therefore need to use indirect ways, or "leading indicators", to assess the possible new economy effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.93,0)">Cyclically adjusted falling unit labour costs, increases in computer investment and a falling ratio of inventories to sales in durable manufacturing are examples of indicators which could be helpful in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Asset prices may also be considered as a "leading indicator" of possible inflationary implications stemming from new economy developments, such as technological development and deregulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, it is far from clear-cut how economic policy-makers should take account of asset prices in the formulation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Stock prices reflect expectations about future earnings, but uncertainties about the timing and magnitude of the economic benefits of new technology are particularly valid for the assessment of future profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.34,0)">This uncertainty leads to very rapid reactions to new information, increased volatility of equity prices and a risk that - in combination with market psychology - unwarranted expectations contribute to the build-up of speculative bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">We have indeed witnessed developments of this kind in the equity markets lately, particularly in the markets for technology-related shares.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">The network nature of the economic behaviour in combination with the present ability to communicate instantaneously in the new economy environment make the reactions stronger and more rapid on a global scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The price/earnings ratios experienced in recent years have been and still are unprecedented from a historical perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">They seem to indicate the belief that profits should permanently - or at least for a very long time - remain on clearly higher levels than previously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">In the longer run, new technology - in combination with other enabling factors - contributes to increased competition in many sectors, and it should thus gradually lead to more compressed profit margins in the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.24,0)">What is the appropriate response of policy-makers to excess volatility of asset prices or the possible emergence of a speculative bubble?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.54,0)">This is a very difficult issue which has been widely discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The Eurosystem - like many other central banks - has as its primary objective to maintain stable consumer prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">We have only one main tool to achieve this objective, namely the short term interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.44,0)">Introducing other variables such as asset prices in the formulation of the policy objective would only be counter-productive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.59,0)">If central banks were very active in trying to smooth the effects of sudden asset price falls, they would easily end up in a moral hazard situation, implying that the next "bubble" could become even worse given the expectation that the central bank would always come to the rescue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.43,0)">In general terms, the research and product cycle has been shortened as well as the speed of adoption of new technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">This, arguably, enhances the uncertainty regarding the medium-term effects of new technology on economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">It is also possible that information technology contributes in general terms to a faster transmission of financial impulses throughout the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.83,0)">If this is the case, the time-lag for the transmission of monetary policy may also become shorter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.71,0)">However, the uncertainty about these parameters increases the decision-making difficulties in respect of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Can anything be learnt from history?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The waves of technological innovation in the past, and their effects on the economy, have provoked debate and discussion very similar to that which we are witnessing today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Any benchmark for comparison taken from the past must have been an innovation that had similar economy-wide effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There are many such innovations; one obvious example is that of electricity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.95,0)">To a substantial extent, technology dictates how the structure of production is organised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.09,0)">Before the arrival of electricity, this was physically organised in a very inefficient way from today's perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.28,0)">At that time, production was organised around a belt-drive system which imposed severe restrictions on the physical infrastructure of factories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">After the introduction of electricity, machines could be plugged into a socket anywhere in the factory, thereby significantly increasing flexibility in the organisation of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Moreover, electric light substantially improved the possibility of extending the working day into the dark hours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Translating this into price developments, it may be claimed that electric light drastically reduced the price per unit   of light.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Electricity also gave rise to important second- order innovations in the fields of transportation and communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We do not know yet if the development of information technology will have different overall effects on productivity from the introduction of electricity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.85,0)">As already mentioned, there is one important difference between the effects of electricity and information technology: electricity affected mainly the physical organisation of work, while the effects of information technology are predominantly of an "invisible" or "intellectual" nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In one respect, information technology has already had much more far-reaching effects than electricity, namely as regards the development of the direct costs of the new technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.2,0)">Over recent decades, the costs of information technology - and thereby also the cost of communication - have fallen in an unprecedented manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.97,0)">The cost of computer processing has fallen by around 99.999% over the last three decades, implying an average real decline of 35% every year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.34,0)">In comparison, electricity prices fell by only 6% per year in real terms between 1890 and 1920.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The more rapid price decline of information technology is not solely the result of the technological development as such, but also reflects a virtuous circle of all the enabling factors I discussed earlier, such as deregulation and increased competition, and the synergies between these factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">These factors are now much more interdependent with technological development than in earlier technological "revolutions".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">As a result of this rapid price decline, information technology is spreading much more swiftly than innovations of earlier times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It took approximately 40 years from the start of commercial production of electric power before it was used by 50% of the manufacturing industry in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">By means of comparison, the internet had in 1999 reached, only seven years after the commercial launch, a penetration rate of more than 40% of the population in the United States .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the EU the corresponding rate was 15%, ranging from 7% in Portugal to 41% in Sweden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">A very important enabling factor behind the faster development and distribution of information technology as compared with previous innovations is the fact that the deep financial markets, and especially the development of venture capital, are affording innovative companies, scientists and technologists more opportunities for funding to pursue promising ideas than previously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It is sometimes claimed that the financial markets were quite developed already at the time of the introduction of electricity and the railway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Although it is true that international trade and cross-border financing flourished during the second half of the 19th century, these activities were heavily concentrated in a few industries and few favoured borrowers such as large railway companies and governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.2,0)">Moreover, the financial markets were not as sophisticated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.08,0)">Now, the situation is entirely different: the international investment activity affects practically all industries   and there are opportunities to find funding also for small companies and risky investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Investors and borrowers can act swiftly in organised and efficient markets..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There are also some other effects of information technology which are different from the experience of the introduction of electricity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">For example, the OECD notes that information technology is transforming the relationship between firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">It helps to lower the costs of outsourcing and co-operation with other firms significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">It is also contributing to shortening the length of product cycles and helping to strengthen the role of science in business as reflected in the growing collaboration between industry and academia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">It facilitates the faster diffusion of ideas and knowledge since it provides the tools for faster and wider communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The need to develop de facto technological standards is leading to an increasing number of alliances between firms in high-tech businesses and to co-operation across industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Again, there is a virtuous circle since information technology can provide powerful tools with which to conduct further scientific research in other areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There are many recent examples that can be mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">For example, the contribution of information technology to the decoding of the genetic language of the human body, which may prove to be a major breakthrough in finding a cure for many genetic diseases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The advent of electricity also enabled innovations in many other fields, which may have had as large effects on welfare and economic development as the direct use of electric power in the manufacturing industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.32,0)">The magnitude of the indirect impact of information technology will only become fully apparent in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But how did the macroeconomic effects following the introduction of electricity compare with the current developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It is not clear if the developments of the 1920s were triggered by the introduction of electricity and related innovations, particularly given the fact that the new technology was introduced only very gradually over a long period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Other "enabling factors" may also have contributed to the economic developments of the 1920s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Nevertheless, it is interesting to see that some of the parallels are indeed extraordinary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">In the 1920s, the growth rate in the United States was in the region of four times as high as those in the major European countries over the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The restrictions on international capital movements were still relatively low and there was a rapid development in the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">There were very strong net capital inflows into the United States during this period, which allowed foreigners to avail themselves of the higher yields in the United States , similar to the experience of the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The productivity improvement in the United States in the 1920s followed in the wake of the large-scale immigration, reflecting a very high degree of labour mobility into more productive sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Stock prices and other asset prices escalated in the 1920s, similar to the way they did in the 1990s, with price/earnings ratios reaching unprecedented levels on the basis of expected permanently higher levels of profitability, particularly in sectors producing or using the new technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">In both cases, uncertainties as regards the profits to be reaped from the implementation of new technology were important factors behind the rise in asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Another similarity is that both the second half of the 1920s   and the second half of the 1990s were periods with relatively prudent macroeconomic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.38,0)">Fiscal policies were rather disciplined with government budgets close to balance or in surplus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Inflation was kept under control, even if the monetary policy regimes of the major central banks were different in the 1920s compared with today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.09,0)">But there were also some - possibly crucial - differences in the macro-economic and structural environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.45,0)">The public sector's share of economic activity was much smaller than it is today, particularly in Europe .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The focus of monetary policy in the 1920s was the external value of the currency in the context of the then prevailing gold standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the recent period the focus has instead clearly been on the internal value of the currency, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">price stability, with a floating exchange rate setting for the large international currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Finally, the public and corporate structures have improved considerably since the 1920's not least as regards prudential supervision of the financial sector as well as corporate risk analysis and reporting requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">On the whole, the similarities between the economic developments of the 1920s and today are interesting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">They are useful to keep in mind when assessing the prospect of the new economy but at the same time it is clear that many factors have changed over the past 70 years strengthening the structures and affecting the behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.57,0)">Why is Europe lagging?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">One important similarity between the 1920s and the 1990s is the fact that productivity gains were much more rapid in the United States than in Europe .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.09,0)">Why is this the case?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.66,0)">Why is the European economy lagging behind the United States when it comes to reaping the economic benefits of innovation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">There are several economies in Europe with high investment in information technology, and which are also scoring well as regards the other enabling factors mentioned earlier, but where the growth and productivity performance has so far been less impressive than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">In particular, Europe has not yet benefited from any significant reduction of the structural unemployment, which is one of the main criteria in order to assess the effects of the new economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We can only speculate about the reasons for this, but it is likely that the performance is influenced by a variety of factors such as regulatory and organisational structure, demographic structure, educational standards, entrepreneurial tradition and spirit, institutional set-up, management style, industrial structure, government style and attitude, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.34,0)">It is very difficult to grasp how all these factors interact in a changing environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.81,0)">The impact of differences in the regulatory and organisational structure is addressed in a recent report by the OECD.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The idea that economy-wide organisations and institutional structures seem to be a factor inhibiting or promoting growth obtains fairly strong support from this work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The OECD study correlates changes in the growth of multi-factor productivity with the level of business investment in research and development as well as with a number of indicators of the degree of regulation in an economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The latter are of most relevance here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.23,0)">The conclusion is that growth in multi-factor productivity is negatively correlated with   administrative regulation,   product market regulation and   employment protection legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Therefore, the higher the degree of regulation, the lower the rate of growth of multi-factor productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">It can be concluded from the study that the US economy generally benefits from its lower degree of regulation as compared with most European economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Differences in educational levels may also be important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the United States , approximately 35% of the adult population has an educational level higher than upper secondary school, while the corresponding rates in the EU countries range between 9% and 28%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">I would also like to underline the importance of leading-edge competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The universities and research institutions of the United States have achieved impressive results as regards the development of leading-edge competence in most areas of science.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.42,0)">There may also be more subtle differences in attitude and spirit between the United States and Europe which affect how rapidly changes are accommodated in society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">For example, it appears that the entrepreneurial spirit is stronger in the United States than in most European countries, even if this is difficult to show with statistical data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Another factor of importance is the difference in the financial system between the United States and Europe .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Various studies show that financial market deepening   contributes to overall economic growth by improving the financing conditions for young, dynamic and risky firms in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Europe with its still rather segmented - nationally and institutionally - financial market structure is lagging behind the United States in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In Europe , the universal banking model still tends to dominate the financial landscape and it does not respond to the need to fund risky projects in the knowledge-based industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Direct access to the capital markets through the issuance of bonds and equities has been the dominant source of funding for such investments in the United States .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As an illustration, it may be mentioned that the outstanding amount of securities issued by non-financial US corporations is more than ten times the corresponding amount of securities issued by euro area corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">However, the rapid deepening and integration of the capital markets in Europe which we have witnessed over the past years - spurred inter alia by the introduction of the euro - are very promising in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We are seeing a gradual increase in the relative importance of non- bank financing and securitisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.96,0)">But the process is still relatively slow since financing practices are influenced by traditions and long-standing business relationships.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">It takes time, especially for smaller companies, to build up the expertise and structures needed to finance themselves directly from the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For example, credit rating is a basic requirement for issuing bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.66,0)">In Europe , the proportion of small and medium-sized companies which are rated is comparatively low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The rating industry is itself not yet as developed in the euro area as it is in the United States .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Nonetheless, some progress is already evident.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Overall, the corporate bond market in the euro area has increased markedly since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">There are good prospects for the pace of development in the European financial markets gaining further momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The far-reaching Financial Services Action Plan endorsed by the EU Council will be instrumental in this respect in order to remove the remaining legal and regulatory barriers between national markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">It is intended to implement the Plan in full by 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">There are also other signs that Europe is closing the gap vis-à-vis the United States .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">In some areas of technology, for example wireless communications, Europe is already leading the technological development globally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">In other fields of information technology, Europe is catching up with the United States as regards investment activity, production and use of the new technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">In Europe , there is widespread support for, and effort invested in, policies that provide an economic environment conducive to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Most importantly, a stability culture has been established in the euro area with a broad consensus on the virtues of fiscal discipline and price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">We have also seen a growing understanding and acceptance of structural reforms needed to further improve the performance of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">There have already been important reforms in tax systems, labour market regulation and social security systems in several euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">But further progress is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The conclusions of the Lisbon Summit in spring 2000 were encouraging in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">They strongly emphasised that structural reform supporting a shift towards a knowledge-based economy would indeed be a powerful tool for sustained growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The challenge is now to ensure that such reform is also undertaken and implemented in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.8,0)">Implications for monetary policy How could then the new economy developments affect the ECB's monetary policy in practice?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Clearly, the overall of objective for monetary policy remains unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The ECB's commitment to maintaining price stability is instrumental in drawing the full benefits from technological developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It ensures low inflation expectations and consequently low and stable interest rates and, thereby, contributes to investment and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">As discussed earlier, it is in practice, however, not easy for the central bank to incorporate the effects of the technological developments and other enabling factors into its forward-looking analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.5,0)">I have already mentioned uncertainties and measurement problems surrounding the economic impact of any new economy effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.97,0)">These effects can be manifested in the form of both supply-side effects from productivity gains and higher potential output, as well as demand effects where consumption and investment are affected via increase of income as well as asset prices and wealth effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It should be noted, though, that the demand effect through the channel of asset prices is likely to be less important in the euro area than in the United States since the holding of equities is much less in Continental Europe than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.47,0)">The supply and demand effects work in opposite directions as regards their risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">An increase in productivity and potential output contributes to lowering inflationary pressures, while rising asset prices and wealth increase demand and thereby lead to higher inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is important for the central bank to estimate not only the magnitude of the supply and demand effects, but also their respective timing, in order to ensure that the monetary policy response is appropriate, taking into account the time-lags of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.04,0)">So far, there seems to be little evidence in statistical data that new economy effects have yet emerged in the euro area on a scale that would, on balance, have any significant impact on the monetary policy formulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.67,0)">The statistical data do not yet give sufficient material to analyse whether new economy effects have changed or will change the transmission mechanism and time-lags for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB in December 2000 assessed potential output growth in the euro area in the context of its annual review of the reference value for growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This analysis led to the conclusion that potential output continues to grow at an annual rate between 2% and 2 ½ %.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.62,0)">Thus, the Governing Council decided to leave the reference value for M3 growth - within the first pillar of ECB's monetary policy strategy - unchanged at 4½% for the year 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">On the basis of current information, no increase in the potential output or in trend growth was seen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.49,0)">However, the Council underlined that, given the existing uncertainties, estimates of potential output have become skewed to the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.39,0)">In a long-term perspective, the monetary policy implications of any new economy effects depend crucially on whether they are of a permanent, long-lasting or a transitory nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">If they were to be of a permanent or long-lasting nature, with everything else remaining equal, a higher productivity growth would imply a higher return on capital and therefore lead to higher real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">This can be derived from the so-called Golden Rule condition which states that an economy that experiences a higher productivity growth will - in equilibrium or in "steady state" - also experience a higher return on capital, which ultimately equals the real interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">As a result, the central bank would have to ensure that nominal interest rates are consistent with the new and higher equilibrium real rate of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">It is interesting to note in this context that both the nominal and the real interest rates have remained considerably higher in the United States than in the countries now belonging to the euro area for a protracted period but that this spread is now closing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the current situation, where there is uncertainty as regards the existence of new economy effects in the euro area, the ECB will monitor developments closely and assess the monetary policy implications of any such effects continuously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, it does not entail any change to the ECB's monetary policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Concluding remarks In conclusion, I would like to underline once again that the new economy is not necessarily something really new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">History shows that there have been many similar quantum leaps which have led to long periods of adjustment with increased productivity and higher potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.7,0)">There are, however, some elements in the current process which are somewhat different from past "revolutions".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Many important enabling factors have coincided with the development of digital technology and the "information revolution".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The synergies of these enabling factors are creating a process which is very likely to become more far-reaching than previous "revolutions".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Nevertheless, the ongoing "revolution" is not changing basic economic laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.28,0)">The recent slowdown in the US economy and, in particular, the collapse of many internet- related companies do not by any means indicate the death of the new economy process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.52,0)">What we are currently witnessing is adjustment pains and learning costs which are natural in any new process with considerable uncertainties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.39,0)">It may also be influenced by normal business cycle developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The effects of technological development, the penetration of the digital technologies and the deregulation of markets are continuing in the stability-oriented environment created by economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In the longer term, it is likely that these developments will indeed contribute to increased productivity and higher growth potential on a global scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.7,0)">The uncertainty concerning the timing and magnitude of the new economy effects is considerable and very much depends on the reactions in terms of economic policies, labour markets and on the part of individuals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.01,0)">History has shown that the lags can be long and the adjustment process can be slow even if there are indications that, in the current environment, the process may be faster than in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">History has also shown that the adjustment process is not necessarily painless.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">A key question is how individual people adjust and react to these changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">As policy-makers, as business leaders, as employees, as consumers and as private individuals, we are all experiencing the effects of the new economy process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However, the attitudes, motivations and capabilities differ very much.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.77,0)">The speed of change and the uncertainty about the future may be very difficult to cope with for many people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">It is important for individuals - and for society as a whole - to have an open, tolerant and courageous attitude when meeting the challenges of change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">At the same time, adequate safety and security systems are needed in order to ensure that the adjustment to the new environment can proceed relatively painlessly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.07,0)">This is a challenge not only to the authorities, but also very much to companies, organisations and the individuals themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.17,0)">The supply-side effects of productivity gains from the new economy may contribute to a reduction in inflationary pressures and would thus call for lower interest rates - all else being equal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">We have often seen this argumentation in the public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.45,0)">However, the picture is, in practice, much more complicated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.9,0)">The demand effects from increased earnings and wealth may in principle also involve upward risks to price stability, particularly if they are associated with expectations of exaggerated future earnings from the new technology and speculative bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">In the longer run, an increase in the real potential growth will invariably cause an increase in the return on capital and thus lead to higher equilibrium real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">In order to maintain price stability, the central bank will have to set higher nominal monetary policy interest rates over the business cycle than would have been the case in an environment with lower potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The assessment of the timing and magnitude of these effects is crucial for the success of monetary policy to take its part in this "revolution" by ensuring the enabling factor of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.32,0)">Annex:   List of</span>
