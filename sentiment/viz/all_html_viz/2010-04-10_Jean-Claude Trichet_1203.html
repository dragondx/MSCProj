    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)"> The Crisis and Beyond Ceremonial address by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat “100 Years of Confindustria”Parma, 10 April 2010 Signor Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri, Signor Presidente della Regione Emilia-Romagna, Signora Marcegaglia, Autorità, Signore e Signori, Ho dinanzi a me “l’Italia che lavora e che produce,” come ebbe a scrivere Luigi Einaudi, salutando il primo embrione di Confindustria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">I cannot deny that I go back to those early days of the past century with some pride.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">As you know, a Frenchman, Louis Bonnefon, christened your centenary Association in 1910, as he became its first Chairman.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">He had descended the Alps from Lyon to neighbouring Piémont – not a long journey, geographically or culturally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">He had become a respected entrepreneur in the textile industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In that region, he had encountered a brewing milieu of industrialists, ready to go from craftsmanship to a new, modern, model of industrial organisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">He found that this new generation of industrialists was inspired by a deep sense of pragmatism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">They had a strong talent for a scientific organisation of labour and capital, an acute taste for innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">They were highly appreciative of technical education – in a country in which “ la formazione umanistica” was considered the most dignified level of knowledge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">They found personal fulfilment in collective progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These people were the first affiliates of Confindustria, when Confindustria was founded in the wake of the global financial panic of 1907.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">At the time – with a sharp contraction in the volume of bank credit – it was necessary for the nascent industrial milieu in northern Italy to establish a common strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.28,0)">Italy, where equity capital traditionally had been scarce, was highly dependent on bank loans for investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.18,0)">But banks had been hit by the international crisis and were retrenching.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">So, in 1910 Confindustria was designed to inspire and promote an “ alleanza tra i produttori” which could strengthen existing enterprises and multiply their number.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Indeed this strategy reinforced the industrial sector and prepared the ground for its incredible success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">From an agrarian society, with large pockets of poverty, Italy raised to the position of a leading industrial power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.78,0)">The 2008 financial panic was no less dramatic than the 1907 crash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">As we enter the second quarter of 2010, the global economy has just begun to emerge from a prolonged period of economic turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In the euro area, we expect a moderate recovery in the current year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.33,0)">But the recent decline in international trade has been sharp, rapid and exceptionally synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.28,0)">This means that the recovery in Europe – a trade superpower – is likely to be surrounded by uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Also, given the diverse pattern of country specialisations within the European Union, the recovery will probably be uneven across regions and sectors, and over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.12,0)">Like in the few years that followed the 1907 crisis – today Italy has been hit hard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.14,0)">As a prime exporter of equipment and machinery, this country has particularly suffered from the lopsided composition of the shortfalls in international trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">But, many times – in the 100 years spanned by Confindustria – after a profound crisis, Italy has gradually moved back to the forefront of innovation and economic excellence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">I am sure Confindustria will be part of this come-back.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">This morning I should share with you my thoughts on the nature of the crisis and on the strategy that I see as an effective tool for a new start, both in Italy and in Europe more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">I will conclude that being able to rely on a solid real economy is an exceptionally valuable asset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The euro and the European Central Bank will accompany and help this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">You, entrepreneurs, will be decisive actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.95,0)">Financial excesses Let me start with a short overview of the nature of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.27,0)">Here, it is critical to draw a distinction between economic risk and financial risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.65,0)">You know what economic risk is: the risk that your companies face when they introduce new products and new processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.31,0)">Investment consumes resources in the present, and its future payoffs are uncertain in time and magnitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.63,0)">This is economic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Historically, the financial industry has been at the forefront of economic progress, because of its ability to offer funding to those who take on economic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But in the recent past the focus of finance has gradually shifted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">From helping the real economy hedge economic risk, the focus of finance has quietly moved toward the creation of financial risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.68,0)">Financial risk is different from economic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.54,0)">It is deliberate exposure to asset price changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.14,0)">Building an exposure to a change in the value of an asset is not bad per se.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But we have to distinguish between arbitrage and directional positioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Arbitrage is an essential market force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Indirectly, it helps production and trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Directional positioning, instead, can amplify and even creates gaps in asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It does so by acting on expectations of future price changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.65,0)">Unlike in the case of arbitrage, these price gaps are notional – indeed, “speculative”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.25,0)">They are often large only because they are not suitably discounted for risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.54,0)">When perceived market risk is moderate, failing to discount for risk is not a severe omission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.69,0)">Indeed, in the ten years that led up to the crisis, financial risk was thought to be low and declining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.13,0)">But, the notion that risk was low and declining was largely an illusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Individually, diversified financial strategies looked all as rational attempts to unload risk to those parties in the system which were more willing to bear it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.38,0)">In the aggregate, however, diversification was subject to a sort of fallacy of composition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Individual strategies were diversified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.11,0)">But the aggregation of a complex web of identical strategies – all designed to shed risk individually – generated a lack of diversity for the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.74,0)">In the end, it turned out that the system could not diversify risk away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.91,0)">Furthermore, the complexity of the financial web made this fact more difficult to identify.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.83,0)">A C.E.O.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.89,0)">of an important bank had a terrible image to describe the euphoric state of the markets, only few weeks before the crisis started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.99,0)">He said that: “When the music stops, in terms of liquidity, things will be complicated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.94,0)">But as long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.67,0)">We’re still dancing.” The ‘dancing’ in the metaphor was an irresponsible credit boom, where banks scrambled for borrowers, and the borrowers could dictate the conditions for credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.83,0)">Confronted with a similar landscape of market euphoria and industrial hardships in the 1920s, Churchill said: “ I would rather see finance less proud and industry more content.” Between, say, 2005 and much of 2007 the system was quietly sliding into a state of meta-stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.71,0)">A system is meta-stable when any external shock – even a trivial disturbance – can tip the balance of stability and trigger an avalanche.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.93,0)">When, on 15 September 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, the turmoil that had started a year earlier turned into an avalanche.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.83,0)">The system moved into a chaotic state, mathematically and metaphorically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.04,0)">The crash In times of financial panic, banks and other financial intermediaries have an instinct to change the composition of their assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.97,0)">They shed risky and illiquid investments and rush to liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.4,0)">In the process, banks’ intermediation is reduced, and loans to companies are curtailed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.44,0)">If the process is let unfold in a disorderly manner, it can create severe damage for borrowers and for the broader economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.07,0)">After the demise of Lehman, liquidity hoarding was so intense that we feared bank intermediation would suffer a complete and lasting collapse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The ECB was the first central bank in the world – a whole year before the Lehman crisis – to recognise the severity of the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As the failure of Lehman precipitated the crisis, the ECB took several measures to protect against a disorderly correction in credit and liquidity conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The ECB provided liquidity in unlimited volumes and with longer maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We insured banks against present and future liquidity shortfalls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">You know that the flow of credit is primarily channelled through banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.03,0)">A complete breakdown in the funding relationships that constitute the inter-bank market for liquidity would have derailed the bank lending channel altogether.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.69,0)">The interruption of the bank lending channel would have turned the financial crisis into a profound depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">By granting unlimited access to central bank liquidity we put banks in a position to maintain their crucial role in the financing of the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">By reducing the interest rate at which banks can borrow liquidity from us we facilitated the transmission of our credit support to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As I speak, the funding ability of banks appears no longer to be a restraining factor for bank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Since the second half of last year, easy funding conditions have been supporting banks’ core business: making loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.23,0)">We still see – in our Bank Lending Survey – a residual slight prevalence of banks declaring a tightening in their credit standards for loans to enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.06,0)">But this is now entirely due to macroeconomic uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.11,0)">A number of banks are still hesitant because the conditions of their borrowers are still fragile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">But in several euro area countries, and Italy is one of them, overall credit standards for corporate loans have already started to ease.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Three ways forward The crisis, no doubt, has changed our world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">I see three ways forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Macroeconomic Policies Macroeconomic policies should concentrate on medium-term objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.29,0)">This is the perspective entrepreneurs take when deciding on the scale of activities, on investment in plant capacity, on hiring and downsizing labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.08,0)">Entrepreneurs do not think of today or tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Entrepreneurs think over the medium to long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is the perspective that should guide macroeconomic authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Let me mention that a similar medium-term perspective has guided fiscal policy in Italy throughout the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The fiscal authority has resisted pressures to introduce fiscal stimulus over and above the loosening of the fiscal stance coming from the operation of the automatic stabilisers that are built into the fiscal code.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This is an appropriate strategy, given Italy’s public debt burden and the prospects for its evolution in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">For what the ECB is concerned, a medium term perspective is what motivates the gradual phasing-out of our extraordinary credit support measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The logic which guides our policy is simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.77,0)">We have granted banks privileged access to credit, when a tightening of their funding conditions would have meant a break-down in the entire chain of intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.64,0)">Now, we have to guard against the possibility that an excess of credit support might become a subsidy to unproductive activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">If excess credit allows banks to reap excessive returns from directional positioning, they might loose an incentive to expand their lending to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.71,0)">In the end, they might become too dependent on central bank credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.59,0)">It is possible that credit flows might be diverted away from the funding of productive activities – your businesses – and toward financial arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.72,0)">You see: underwriting and servicing a loan to a company is resource intensive for a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.76,0)">Maintaining an active trading book is less so, particularly if risks are incorrectly priced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">We have decided that we will gradually return to normal procedures for granting liquidity to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">This will cure opportunistic bidding behaviour and discourage unproductive arbitrage across assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Financial Reform The second way forward is financial reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This needs to be global in scope and surgical in its focus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">No segment of the market or category of players has been immune to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We need to immunise the financial system against its intrinsic tendency to complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.09,0)">Three intrinsic weaknesses need correction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">First, the transparency of the financial structures needs to be enhanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.23,0)">Financial innovation cannot be built upon – and exploit – gaps in investor information and lack of financial literacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">All institutions, instruments and markets of any relevance for systemic stability need to enhance risk disclosure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.01,0)">Second, short-termism in the design of financial contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Market participants were given strong economic incentives to focus on short-term profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">“Due diligence” was not a concern in the pre-crisis world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.74,0)">Collectively, this has resulted in excessive risk taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Third, and perhaps foremost, the pro-cyclicality of the financial system needs to be mitigated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The quality and quantity of bank capital and their liquidity buffers have to be improved in good times to provide a sufficient buffer for bank equity to withstand the inevitable increase in credit risk when the cycle turns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.48,0)">The cyclicality of market economies is inevitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.45,0)">But the financial system should not be allowed to amplify swings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">These three points – and others – are now in the mission of the G-20, the new prime forum of international cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The G20 has entrusted many of these tasks to the Financial Stability Board – headed by Mario Draghi.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The business activities that you represent here should benefit from financial reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Lenders will be made more attentive to the real economic prospects of their borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Long-term value creation will – once again – be the criterion for granting credit to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Structural Change Entrepreneurs will be important actors of structural change, my third way forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Here we can build on assets that have made our real economies in the Continent successful: our openness to trade; our balanced and dynamic business structures; our talented and well-trained workforces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">None of these factors is single-faced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">I mentioned already that the openness of our economies has been seen as a major challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Greater openness has meant that our economies have been more exposed to the international crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">But the past trend to global trade integration has already called for a major adjustment in the euro area production patterns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Many countries in the European Union have adjusted their export portfolios according to the technological advantages of advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.73,0)">In Italy, about half of the firms with 20 or more employees are engaged in restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Many of them are consolidating their technological edge and diversifying their markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">They have moved towards products that are more skill-intensive and more capital-intensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">This upgrade of our production structure will make European – and Italian – firms better prepared for international markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">We already see signs of improvements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Extra-euro area export volumes have rebounded markedly over the last few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This rebound has been broad-based, but particularly pronounced for capital goods and intermediate goods, where Europe and Italy are important suppliers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">The geographical composition of foreign demand will also be a supporting factor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">It is relatively strong for Eastern European countries which do not belong to the Union, for OPEC members, as well as for Latin America and Africa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">All these regions account for almost a quarter of euro area exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">At the same time, a self-sustaining recovery cannot abstract from intra-Union trade and domestic investment in plant capacity, technologies and human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Here, many members of the European Union – and this country in particular – need to advance farther.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.28,0)">The lack of investment in capital and skills erodes competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.81,0)">Lack of long-term economic competitiveness, in turn, can sap confidence and undermine the Union’s internal cohesion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Economies, such as Italy, that in the aggregate have observed a decrease in their market shares need to launch a new long-term competitiveness strategy to harness domestic manpower, skills and capital to the best of their potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Structural reforms are critical to this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And I would like to refer here to the constant messages of Banca d'Italia on reforms in the markets of goods and services, in the labour market and in the domain of pensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">I would also mention three points: an upgrade of high-level education is the top one; regulatory simplification and the reduction of bureaucratic costs for business activity – in particular for business start-ups; and the dismantling of rent-seeking positions – which tax disposable incomes and the economic potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">In Italy, in particular, the pricing chain – notably in the service sector – would benefit from be streamlined to increase the flexibility of goods prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">None of these avenues will be possible without a critical commitment on the side of the public authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">But in the end, as I said, you entrepreneurs are very important actors of structural change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Concluding remarks You have a sound platform on which you can build your future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">First, healthy private finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.31,0)">Italy never indulged in the financial excesses of the recent past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It remains a manufacturing economy, where finance is first and foremost a support to real economic production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Strong saving propensities and prudent banking represent a platform of security from which the economy can restart.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.88,0)">Second, the euro has shielded your economy from the worst consequences of a financial fright of historical proportions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">You know that the people of Europe can count on us, the ECB and the Eurosystem, to continue to be a solid anchor of stability and confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Third, and no less important, you have a strong tradition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Remember that Italy’s manufacturing sector withstood many challenges in recent history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As in the past, the real economy of production and innovation which you represent here today will return back to the front line where it has belonged since the end of the War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">For all of us in Europe, the force to boot-strap ourselves out of the present hardships will come from inside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">And we know that technological progress will continue unabated in Europe.</span>
