    <span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)"> Welcome remarks at the ECB-EC conference on financial integration and stability Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECB-EC conference “Financial integration and stability: towards a more resilient single financial market”Frankfurt am Main, 26 April 2012 Ladies and Gentlemen, On behalf of both the ECB and our co-host, the Commission, I am delighted to welcome you to today’s conference “Financial integration and stability: towards a more resilient single financial market”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">In particular, it is my pleasure to welcome our distinguished speakers and panellists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">As you all know, the Eurosystem has a keen interest in financial integration and in the efficient functioning of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Financial integration helps to maintain balanced monetary and financial conditions and thereby fosters a smooth transmission of monetary policy throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Financial integration also plays an important role for financial stability, as financial integration and financial stability can be mutually reinforcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">As evidenced by the years prior to the financial crisis, the stability of the financial system contributes to financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">At the same time, a more integrated financial sector typically improves the resilience of the financial system through more competition, better diversification and risk-sharing, as well as through more liquid markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The advantages of stable and integrated financial markets are manifold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">They allow us to reap the benefits of the single EU market for capital and financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">A better allocation of capital translates into lower prices, more choices for individuals, better business opportunities for firms and ultimately leads to higher economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Hence, for the last quarter of a century, the creation of a single market for capital and financial services has been a central goal of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Pursuit of this goal has generated many policy initiatives over the years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Most recently, the launch of the euro was a landmark achievement in this regard, and the Financial Services Action Plan has removed major obstacles to financial integration that stemmed mainly from legal and regulatory segmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">As a result of these policy initiatives, financial integration increased steadily in the years leading up to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">However, the process was not homogeneous across all sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">In some market segments such as the money and financial markets, financial integration increased significantly and rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.6,0)">In others, however, the process was slower and, in fact, never completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The case in point is retail banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Despite differences in speed in different sectors, it was widely assumed that financial integration was a continuous process, that financial integration was a one-way street once all legal barriers were removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.81,0)">However, the financial crisis has demonstrated that financial integration cannot be taken for granted: the process of financial integration was brought to a halt and even reversed in some market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I see two main reasons for this development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">First, some market developments before the crisis were not really signs of increasing integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.91,0)">What I am referring to is the complete compression of cross-country yield differentials before 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.61,0)">While the compression had been interpreted as an indicator of financial integration, it was, in fact, a sign of a systematic underpricing of credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.64,0)">And second, the pre-crisis institutional set-up had shortcomings and proved unable to support the single market in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Regulation, supervision and crisis management had been organised along national lines, with some elements of cross-border cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.48,0)">This approach was incapable of adequately preventing the build-up of risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.46,0)">Moreover, when the risks finally materialised, the fragmented crisis management arrangements led to policy responses that were rational from a national perspective, but suboptimal from a European point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.83,0)">The fragmented arrangements also induced banks to withdraw behind national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.73,0)">The resulting halt of financial integration, and even reversal in some segments, was the first setback in the European Union’s quest to achieve a single market for capital and financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">To preserve the benefits of a single market and to reverse these trends, decisive action has since been taken in different directions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Where economic governance is concerned, new crisis resolution instruments have been created: the European Financial Stability Facility has been established, and the European Stability Mechanism will enter into force shortly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">A key milestone in this respect is also the adoption of the “six-pack”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Let me take this opportunity to warmly thank the Commission for the work that has been done in these areas through difficult times in the last years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Regarding the financial sector, financial supervision underwent a comprehensive reform: three European Supervisory Authorities were established, and the European Systemic Risk Board now adds an EU-wide macro-prudential perspective that was missing before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In addition, the regulatory framework is being overhauled with a view to strengthening the resilience of financial market participants and the financial infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And finally, the EU framework for crisis management and resolution is currently being revised so as to address deficiencies highlighted by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">All these ongoing reform efforts are important steps towards closer integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Looking forward, it will be crucial that the current initiatives are completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Undoubtedly, these reforms are significant and would even have been unlikely without the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">However, it is also indisputable that financial integration is a process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Future financial developments will constantly put the institutional framework to the test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The current reform efforts are therefore part of the journey, and not the end of the road.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Let me close by wishing you all the best for an interesting and productive conference today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">I am sure that the lessons of the crisis, the current institutional reforms and the future prospect of financial integration give us plenty of food for discussion.</span>
