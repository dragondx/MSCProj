    <span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)"> Eurozone cross-fire: the way out of economic recession - Assessment of a realist and a response to idealists and cynics Speech by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Bank of America/Merill Lynch Investor conference,Washington DC, 20 April 2013 Sylvie, Laurence, Ladies and gentlemen, Thank you very much for inviting me to speak at today’s investor conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.83,0)">Introduction The Eurozone can be difficult to understand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.16,0)">Especially when seen from this side of the Atlantic, the complexities of the macroeconomic and financial situation and of the political dynamics in Europe can be baffling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">To cut through the complexity and amidst fragile confidence and the ‘noise’ of crisis management simple answers and “once-and-for-all solutions” seem attractive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.52,0)">Unfortunately, this kind of answer is an illusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.53,0)">Because the crisis in the euro area is multi-faceted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.37,0)">It is, at once, a crisis of public and private debt, a crisis of competitiveness and growth, and a crisis of trust; in institutions, in politics and in decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Tackling the crisis successfully and comprehensively will require solutions for all of those.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.73,0)">When I read the commentary, especially over here, on the crisis in Europe, I often see two stereotypical responses, those from what I would call “idealists” and those from “cynics”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.42,0)">First, the idealists: they say the euro area is too heterogeneous and divergent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.02,0)">They say the euro area must integrate completely, or risk breaking up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">As a solution to resolve the crisis, they allege that only a move to a ‘United States of Europe’ will do, with joint issuance of debt, a transfer mechanism, and ‘the works’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.42,0)">Then there are the ‘cynics’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.42,0)">They accuse Europeans of practising ‘medieval medicine’ - bleeding the patients in a bid to cure them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.16,0)">They contend the ‘bitter pill of austerity’ will kill the patient, and the people will not take it any longer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">They say that overcoming the crisis will need more time, less austerity; more public money, less reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And they often call on the ECB to do more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.02,0)">I believe none of these caricatures reflect the reality of the response in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.33,0)">The US journalist Sydney J. Harris once wrote “an idealist believes the short run doesn’t count.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.63,0)">A cynic believes the long run doesn’t matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.4,0)">A realist believes that what is done or left undone in the short run determines the long run”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I believe it is imperative to convey, not only the short-term outlook for the euro area, but also to dispel certain generalisations regarding the ongoing adjustment in Europe and the long-run vision for Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In this context, allow me to briefly outline what I would consider, a ‘realist’s assessment’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The on-going adjustment in EMU The adjustment in the Eurozone is underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.29,0)">There is also no doubt it is painful, especially for the people in some countries of the periphery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">However, let me give you some evidence of what has actually been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In programme countries, we have seen a strong improvement of structural primary balances since 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In Greece, for example, this is estimated to have improved by more than 14 percentage points of GDP between 2009 and 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">To put this into context, in this country, the ‘sequester’ calls for cuts of 1.2 trillion dollars over ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The equivalent of what Greece has done would have meant for the US an adjustment of 1.6 trillion dollars over three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In EMU, this adjustment is being undertaken within a reinforced fiscal framework – a new set of rules – which strengthens the ability to prevent and correct the accumulation of excessive deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Furthermore, a new framework for the surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances has been established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">And also on this front, a very large correction of external imbalances is visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In Greece, Portugal and Ireland, the current account balances have each improved by more than 7 percentage points of GDP between 2008 and 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.67,0)">It is true that much of the adjustment has been driven by a contraction in domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">However, in Ireland and Portugal export performance has also been strong, because programme countries are now reaping the benefits from their significant improvement in cost competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This is evident from the significant reduction in unit labour costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">For Greece, Ireland and Portugal we see about a 10 percentage point improvement relative to the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The adjustment in Ireland has been spectacular, and translates into about an 18 percentage point improvement between 2008 and 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.36,0)">This means that the past excesses have by and large been undone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.98,0)">Government bond spreads now fluctuate at much lower levels compared with the peak of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">This will eventually also facilitate the return to bond market access in Ireland and Portugal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This was also assisted by the announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions  , which contributed significantly to removing redenomination risk in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.38,0)">Some may ask: why can’t the ECB do more?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.42,0)">Why can’t the ECB be more like the Federal Reserve… or the Bank of Japan, for that matter?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.79,0)">Why can’t the ECB engage in quantitative easing or have an employment target?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Those who make these calls must first consider the very different institutional set-up in which we operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The ECB can only take measures that are consistent with its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Our primary objective is price stability, we do not have the wide mandate which for example the Federal Reserve has.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.88,0)">Second, the structure of the financial market in Europe is very different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the US, for example, a large share of financial intermediation takes place through capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This provides a broad and deep pool of assets to purchase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">However, the structure of the euro area economy is largely bank based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Thus our monetary policy strategy must be tailored accordingly, mainly through the provision of credit to the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Third, the specific economic challenges we face differ from those in other parts of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In this day and age, where many look to central banks as the ultimate problem-solvers of many economic ills, let me also be clear that there are clear limits of what we, the ECB, can – and cannot – do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.45,0)">We cannot repair unsound budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.18,0)">We cannot clean up struggling banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.83,0)">We cannot solve deep-rooted problems in the structure of Europe’s economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Conclusion I want to conclude with some clear messages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.19,0)">To the cynics, my message is: we will not solve a debt crisis with more debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.68,0)">Moreover, simply giving more time will not resolve the underlying structural problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Member States who are implementing the necessary adjustments have begun to reap the benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.14,0)">Relaxing now would mean endangering the hard-won gains of past efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">The foundations of future growth are fiscal sustainability coupled with structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">In a way, we have a ‘debt ceiling’ in Europe too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.42,0)">It is not set by an Act of Congress, but by the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.49,0)">Investors have clearly shown they are not willing to further finance Member States with such high levels of debt, at a reasonable price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Therefore the adjustment must continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">To the idealists, my message is that the EU is, at this stage, an emerging union, built on the basis of Member States who agree – or disagree – to pool sovereignty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.31,0)">Moving to a deeper economic integration, which is commensurate with a monetary union, is necessarily a process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">But it is underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Such a deeper economic union will not be the archetypical Union, which some of you may have in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is worth remembering that the Union on this side of the Atlantic was built over almost 250 years, and it took 150 years to establish a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.75,0)">The EU is 60 years old, and the euro, only 13.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Over recent years, the euro area has taken big steps forward to reinforce its framework for fiscal and macroeconomic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Member States continue to display unprecedented solidarity towards each other, providing financing for programmes of economic adjustment along with the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The establishment of a banking union, including a single supervisory mechanism involving the ECB and, the forthcoming proposal for a single resolution mechanism, are further examples of deeper integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.34,0)">Earlier this year, the ECONOMIST reviewed last year’s doomsday predictions about the imminent demise of the Eurozone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.13,0)">It noted correctly that “the pessimists did not overestimate the euro’s problems, so much as underestimate the political will to do enough to stop a euro break-up.” Going forward, it would be a grave error to underestimate the continuing political commitment to making the single currency a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.13,0)">But it also remains true what was once said, namely that EU institution-building is like the love-life of the elephant: Everything goes on at a very high level, a lot of dust gets raised - and you have to wait for months and years for results.</span>
