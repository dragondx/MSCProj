    <span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)"> Financial globalisation and excess liquidity: monetary policies and new uncertainties Remarks by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBEuro50-Natixis breakfast seminarWillard Intercontinental Hotel, Washington DC21 October 2007 Understanding liquidity I would like to start my remarks by distinguishing two different – but related – concepts of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The first concept of liquidity is related to the easiness with which a certain asset can be converted into cash, which by definition is the most liquid asset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">More broadly, it is the easiness with which financial and real assets can be purchased and sold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We can call it “market liquidity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.72,0)">In addition to the intrinsic characteristics of the financial instrument, market liquidity is inversely related to the degree of information asymmetry prevailing among economic agents: as shown by Akerlof in his celebrated analysis of the “market for lemons”, a market may altogether disappear   if information is sufficiently asymmetric.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.84,0)">The degree of information asymmetry can vary over time, reflecting both fundamental factors as well as shifts in market sentiment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.82,0)">This is what is happening in the present market turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.84,0)">Liquidity is thus a time-varying variable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Liquidity has to be distinguished from riskiness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A financial asset can be very risky but at the same time very liquid, if its risk is precisely and broadly understood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.25,0)">Having said this, it is also more likely for a risky asset to be subject to asymmetric information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Therefore, risk appetite and liquidity often go hand in hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.74,0)">A general re-pricing of risk may be accompanied by shifts in the degree of liquidity of the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.89,0)">The second concept of liquidity is the quantity of liquid assets held by households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This reflects, for the most part, portfolio decisions by economic agents in relation to prevailing monetary and financial conditions, the latter linked to, inter alia, the stance of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We can call this second concept “macro liquidity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Over recent years we have seen a surge in macro liquidity, in tandem with an unusually low level of short and long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In my opinion, and as I have argued elsewhere  , financial globalisation has substantially contributed to the creation of global macro liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.65,0)">This has been due to the combination of high savings in developing countries such as China, which have increased the appetite for liquid assets  , and insufficient production of financial liabilities, as a result of the still underdeveloped legal and financial technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.52,0)">The net result of this process may have been a downward push on real   equilibrium interest rates, which explains the apparently paradoxical co-existence of strong global growth and low real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This has allowed central banks in advanced countries to keep interest rates low without igniting inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.81,0)">However, expansionary monetary policies and carry trades may have contributed to temporarily rising global macro liquidity, and it is not easy to disentangle these temporary phenomena from more long-lasting influences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The two concepts of global liquidity that I have described are different but related.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.93,0)">If financial globalisation has been pushing down expected returns, it might also have affected incentives towards risk-taking in financial markets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.12,0)">This is what is commonly referred to as the “search for yield”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.61,0)">It may also have affected the incentives to collect information in financial markets, which   is a commodity like any other and is influenced by market prices  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.38,0)">Low interest rates may therefore have directly contributed to creating information asymmetries, sowing the seeds for the liquidity problems that we experience nowadays.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The relationship between market and macro liquidity is not necessarily stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.12,0)">Indeed, in normal times abundant global macro liquidity tends to be associated with high market liquidity, reflecting low interest rates and spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.62,0)">However, at times of financial turmoil, market liquidity may dry out even in the presence of abundant macro liquidity if, as is currently the case, the latter is not exchanged between market participants who want to retain for themselves available financing rather than trading it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.18,0)">Also in this case, in financial markets quantities are not always the mirror image of prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.65,0)">What can central banks do?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Central banks can do mainly three things to take into account the impact of changing liquidity conditions on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">First, central banks should monitor both indicators of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is important from both a monetary policy and a financial stability perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.03,0)">In fact, shocks affecting monetary and credit aggregates and more generally liquidity conditions have the potential, as we are seeing now, to affect asset prices, confidence, credit conditions and ultimately inflationary pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is why it is important to monitor liquidity, in a broad sense, from a monetary policy perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The two-pillar strategy of the ECB is an asset in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Indeed, the monetary analysis pays close attention to trends in monetary and credit aggregates and to the behaviour of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In the current market turmoil, it enables the provision of information on several key variables which would not be available under simpler frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.75,0)">Central banks have to be aware, of course, that financial innovation and globalisation may complicate the monetary analysis and affect the impact of monetary policy on the creation of liquidity by the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.07,0)">In particular, the recent market turmoil may have increased the amount of reserves in central bank money that banks need in order to carry out their intermediation role, leading to a dampening of the money multiplier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Second, central banks should warn market participants not to take liquidity for granted, especially market liquidity, and to test their portfolio decisions also under stressful conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.64,0)">The ECB has repeatedly expressed the concern that buoyant global liquidity and risk appetite could result in an abrupt re-pricing of risk and sudden shifts in liquidity, as we have witnessed in recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.55,0)">For example, the June 2007 Financial Stability Review  , prior to the August turmoil, stated: “If history is any guide, liquidity can vanish abruptly from financial markets when investor uncertainty and risk aversion rise… and primary issuers… could struggle to find investors for their securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Some banks would also face heightened counterparty risks if the institutions they have extended credit to are thrown into financial distress.” Finally, a central bank should stand ready to ensure the proper functioning of the payment system and the money market, even in case of disruption, so that its monetary policy impulse is adequately transmitted to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">The ECB and other central banks have done so since early August, lending funds to market participants with a view to promoting appropriate market liquidity conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">However, the restoration of normal conditions over the whole maturity spectrum does not hinge only on central bank action but also on the return of confidence and trust by market participants, both in the other participants and in themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.78,0)">Financial institutions still fear the risk that some counterparties may face funding problems, as reflected in the high spreads on credit default swaps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.44,0)">They also seem to fear the risk of not being able themselves to access funding in the market, if needed, in particular towards the end of the year when financial accounts will be completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Financial institutions are thus aggressively bidding for funds and keeping these funds on their balance sheets rather than lending them to other banks, thus taking advantage of the high spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.58,0)">Some kind of end-of-the-year fear, similar to the Y2K problem experienced at the start of this century, seems to have developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.31,0)">This fear is totally unjustified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Central banks have clearly shown their willingness and availability to intervene in the market to maintain orderly conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The ECB, in particular, has recently announced its intention to intensify its actions aimed at reducing the variability of the overnight rate around the MRO rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This has partly contributed to reducing the spread on the three-month interbank rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The ECB will continue this strategy, including around the end of the year, if the need arises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">There can be no doubt about this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">There should thus be no Y2K-type fear in the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The experience of Y2K itself has shown that central banks are fully equipped to manage this type of situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">L. Bini Smaghi  : Global imbalances and monetary policy, Journal of Policy Modeling, 29, pp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.67,0)">711-727.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">MRO stands for main refinancing operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">A press release on 8 October 2007 stated that “The ECB continues to closely monitor liquidity conditions and aims at further reducing the volatility of very short term rates around the MRO minimum bid rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">For this purpose, the ECB will reinforce its policy of allocating more liquidity than the benchmark amount in main refinancing operations to accommodate the demand of counterparties to fulfil reserve requirements early within the maintenance period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.82,0)">The difference between the allotted and the benchmark amount is envisaged to decline gradually in the course of the maintenance period, taking into account the prevailing market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The ECB still aims at balanced liquidity conditions at the end of the maintenance period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The ECB will steer liquidity towards more balanced conditions also during the maintenance period, in a way which is consistent with the objective to keep very short term rates close to the minimum bid rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The ECB will follow this policy for as long as needed.”</span>
