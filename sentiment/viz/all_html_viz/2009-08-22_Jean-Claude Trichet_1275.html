    <h1> Credible alertness revisited </h1>
    <h2> Intervention by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the symposium on “Financial stability and macroeconomic policy” sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 22 August 2009 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)"> Credible alertness revisited Intervention by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB,at the symposium on “Financial stability and macroeconomic policy”sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming, 22 August 2009 It is a pleasure to be part of such a distinguished panel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In my remarks today, I will discuss three topical issues facing central banks, in particular in the light of recent events: the relationship between asset prices and monetary policy; the effectiveness of our standard interest rate instrument; and the design of non-standard monetary policy measures such as the ECB’s enhanced credit support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The ongoing financial crisis has highlighted the importance of old issues and raised some new questions, for which I will try to offer an ECB perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Exactly four years ago, here in Jackson Hole, I spoke about “credible alertness” in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Today it seems opportune to revisit this concept in light of recent events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">“Leaning against the wind” and monetary analysis The best way to manage a crisis is to avoid it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Given the important role played by asset markets in recent macroeconomic dynamics, the experience of the past few years has given renewed impetus to the debate on asset prices and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Would making monetary policy more responsive to asset market developments have avoided the financial crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">More generally, should monetary policy “lean against the wind” of surging asset prices?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The academic debate on this issue is ongoing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.26,0)">For instance, there is currently disagreement regarding the appropriate models and simulations to use when weighing up the pros and cons of such an approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.49,0)">Within policy-oriented discussions, there has been scepticism about leaning against the wind for three reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.67,0)">First, there have been reservations about the possibility of identifying asset price misalignments or “bubbles” in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.76,0)">Second, doubts have been expressed regarding the ability of interest rate increases of a plausible magnitude to contain surging asset prices once these have achieved a momentum of their own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Third, it has been argued that any damage to the economy stemming from an asset price correction can be contained by prompt and aggressive easing of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">What have recent events taught us about leaning against the wind?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Allow me to address each of these three reservations in turn, beginning with the identification of asset price misalignments in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.43,0)">A number of central bankers were pointing to the underpricing of risk and the excessive pace of credit expansion in 2006 and 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.62,0)">While remaining prudent as regards our qualification of the situation, many of us felt uneasy about the growing financial imbalances emerging in that period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The increasing risks identified by the ECB’s monetary analysis from 2005 onwards, with money and credit growth accelerating to double-digit levels, are well documented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.53,0)">All of this suggests that it was clearly not impossible to identify   the emergence of financial imbalances and misalignments in the pricing of risks – and therefore also in the pricing of assets – in the years preceding the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Research findings increasingly support this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Work at the BIS and the ECB shows that monetary and credit indicators can provide an early warning where asset price developments are unsustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.52,0)">Of course, such indicators are not perfect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.33,0)">There is undoubtedly a risk of mistakenly leaning against asset price developments that are justified on fundamental grounds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.62,0)">But policy-makers continually confront such informational problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.27,0)">Many indicators used prominently in the formulation of policy decisions are subject to revision and difficult to measure in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.57,0)">Indicators of asset price misalignments are no different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.03,0)">But I do not believe that such difficulties should be seen as a fundamental obstacle to making an assessment of the risks posed by excessive asset price developments on the basis of the information available to us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.25,0)">Turning to the second reservation expressed in the literature: what of the assertion that interest rate increases will be unable to halt an asset price surge?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Prima facie, to the extent that an asset price bubble promises to deliver large capital gains, a small change in policy interest rates is unlikely to alter the balance between the costs of financing the bubble and the expected profits from investing in it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.08,0)">From this perspective, a policy of leaning against the wind would appear to have limited value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">It is interesting to see, however, that recent research identifies channels through which even a small change in policy rates can have important implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.01,0)">For example, the profitability of financial institutions that systematically borrow short and lend long can be significantly affected by even a small change in policy interest rates, triggering the closing-out of leveraged positions and the moderation of asset price growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.52,0)">To the extent that policy rate changes break private sector herding behaviour or reveal central bank intentions and private information, even a small change in policy rates can have a significant impact on asset price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Such research suggests that a policy of leaning against the wind may have greater impact than previously thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Turning to the third reservation: what of the alternative approach – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.34,0)">waiting until an asset bubble bursts and then easing policy aggressively so as to contain the adverse effects on real activity and inflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.51,0)">Recent experience has clearly demonstrated the limitations of such a strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.51,0)">Unprecedented policy action has failed to prevent a sharp fall in economic activity in the context of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.64,0)">Moreover, an ex ante approach of this kind risks creating moral hazard on a large scale, thereby helping to place the system in a metastable situation, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.1,0)">a state of potential unstability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">By contrast, a strategy of leaning against the wind could reduce moral hazard: by behaving more symmetrically, a central bank can encourage more responsible behaviour on the part of investors and make a crisis less likely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Over the past few years, both experience and developments in the literature appear to support a shift in favour of the adoption of some form of leaning against the wind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">However, having spent 16 years facing the successive challenges of operational central banking, I am doubtful that such a strategy can be implemented in a mechanical way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.21,0)">The uncertainties remain too great, and perhaps always will.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">What is required is a significant degree of judgement, embedded in a rule-based framework for policy making, which encapsulates the essence of leaning against the wind without suggesting that central banks are in a position to manage closely – much less target – developments in asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In the case of the ECB, the medium-term orientation of our two-pillar monetary policy strategy calls on us to consider the implications that financial imbalances and asset price misalignments and their unwinding have as regards the outlook for price developments at longer horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Given that our mandate requires the maintenance of price stability on an ongoing and continuous basis, rather than at any specific arbitrary horizon, we consider it important to monitor the slow accumulation of unsustainable financial imbalances which pose a threat to macroeconomic and price stability over the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Maintaining a medium-term orientation, keeping a close eye on monetary and credit dynamics, and adopting a broader, stability-oriented view of policy making – which are key elements of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy – supports this approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Our monetary analysis provides us with a framework within which to assess the dynamics of asset prices, money and credit from a medium-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">For example, monetary analysis was decisive in our decision to keep the ECB policy rate at 2%, instead of reducing it further, in the summer of 2004 and to start raising it in late 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.23,0)">On both occasions, the strength of money and credit growth in the euro area, with liquidity already ample, pointed to risks to price and macroeconomic stability over the medium term that went beyond those identified by standard forms of economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.19,0)">One of these risks was the sustainability of asset price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.17,0)">These policy decisions were taken in the face of some criticism from those who regarded monetary indicators as old-fashioned, including parts of academia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">However, with the   benefit of hindsight, most observers now take the view that such decisions were correctly timed and appropriately judged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">More generally, it was always foreseen that the close monitoring of monetary developments would provide a framework for addressing asset price misalignments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">However, viewing asset price dynamics through the lens of monetary developments integrates them into an overall framework directed towards the achievement of our goal: price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.19,0)">One particular focus of our monetary analysis is the low-frequency trend in money and credit developments and the associated emergence of imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">This focus allows us both to assess risks to price stability in the medium to long term and, simultaneously, to embed some implicit leaning against excessive money, credit and asset price growth in our interest rate decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">As part of our strategic decision to enhance monetary analysis,   the ECB has conducted research looking at monetary and credit developments so as to better understand their impact on macroeconomic outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Interaction with asset price dynamics plays an important role in this work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Increasingly, the results of this research are being integrated into our regular assessment of monetary developments, which is one source of input for our policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">My understanding is that the importance of monitoring money and credit developments is generally recognised by central bankers and more and more also by academia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Of course, recognising their importance does not necessarily simplify the task of interpreting those developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.61,0)">Experience has shown that ongoing financial innovation complicates the interpretation of the monetary data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This remains a substantial practical challenge – but one that must be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Making the analysis of money and credit developments operational is a key area for new research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">A year ago, here at Jackson Hole, Tobias Adrian and Hyun Song Shin argued that structural changes to the financial system require the definition of new monetary indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">There has recently been a focus on the build-up of leverage within the financial sector, through loans between banks and loans to various special-purpose financing vehicles, some of which may be located offshore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This kind of approach forms part of the comprehensive assessment of monetary developments undertaken at the ECB, which extends well beyond the monitoring of headline aggregates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">We recognise that considerable progress still needs to be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">However, overall, our maintenance of both the statistical basis for monetary analysis and the necessary staff expertise at a time when the value of such work was being very much called into question has, in my view, helped us significantly in taking important decisions in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Taking everything into account, I would say that we feel encouraged to continue relying on our two-pillar strategy, noting that considerable further progress still needs to be made in various areas of research that are part of our enhancement of monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Credibility, alertness and steady-handedness I will now turn to my second topic: the effectiveness of interest rate decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Even in the face of the exceptional challenges of recent years, the standard interest rate instrument has remained a crucial component of the central bank armoury as regards monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Our interest rate decisions should be judged on their effectiveness, understood as the contribution they make to the achievement of the ECB’s objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Effectiveness requires that policy decisions be transmitted to the economy, so as to influence private price-setting behaviour and thus developments in the price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In this respect, understanding the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">There is a considerable amount of academic literature in this area,   to which researchers at the ECB have contributed in important ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.61,0)">In this literature, it is widely recognised that households and firms’ spending decisions are affected by longer-term interest rates, rather than the very short-term rates steered in monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.09,0)">Moreover – especially in a bank-based financial system, such as that of the euro area – many borrowers’ decisions are influenced by bank lending rates, rather than market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Consequently, in order to be effective, policy rate changes must influence rates at longer maturities and be passed through to rates on bank loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Viewed from this perspective, conferring a degree of persistence on developments in policy rates may be crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">A central bank with a reputation for implementing persistent interest rate changes will be able to convince market participants that an initial interest rate change will be maintained for some time and/or followed by additional changes in the same direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Such expectations will have a strong, immediate impact on the money market yield curve at longer maturities, since money market rates are largely determined by expectations of future policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.2,0)">Persistent policy changes are also more likely to affect bank lending rates, since a persistent rate change is more likely to be passed through.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Both channels will allow the effectiveness of changes in the policy rate to be enhanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Of course, when taking our decisions, we are not mechanically bound by such observations on monetary policy, despite the intellectual elegance of the underlying models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Nevertheless, I can recognise the pattern of the ECB’s interest rate decisions in this stylised characterisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.54,0)">The lower-frequency component of the interest rate cycle – which is driven by long-lasting or persistent developments in policy rates – influences economic behaviour and, ultimately, the evolution of price developments much more than the high-frequency component associated with the exact timing and magnitude of any one policy decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.13,0)">Whether interest rates increase by 25 or 50 basis points in one month or another is less important than our ability to steer the longer-maturity rates of relevance to spending decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">While the former may dominate ECB watchers’ commentaries, it is the latter that gives us the leverage to stabilise longer-term inflation expectations and fulfil our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">With this consideration in mind, our approach has often been characterised as “steady-handed”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The ECB has acquired a reputation for moving interest rates in a steady and persistent fashion over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is a conscious choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Such deliberate and persistent moves strengthen transmission, thereby proving effective in achieving our objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">When a central bank enjoys a reputation for implementing monetary policy in a steady-handed fashion, private sector expectations of future interest rates will move in a manner consistent with policy-makers’ intentions at all maturities in response to a policy announcement or measure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.71,0)">As a result, changes in policy rates will have significantly larger effects on aggregate demand and future price developments than would otherwise be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">By implication, less extreme changes in policy interest rates will be necessary in order to achieve our goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Our reputation for steady-handed – and thus effective – policy action will be bolstered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">And more effective policy action will contribute to a successful track record in terms of meeting our objective, thereby delivering price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">An effective monetary policy need not, therefore, be an “activist” monetary policy, at least to the extent that activism is understood to imply significant immediate changes to policy rates in response to individual pieces of short-term economic “news”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">While a central bank must always be ready to act in response to shocks that threaten price stability, a steady-handed approach, involving a modest initial change in policy rates followed by further moves in the same direction, may prove more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.59,0)">Therefore, criticising a central bank that is acting with a steady hand for being “behind the curve” rather misses the point: a gradualist approach of this kind may be the most effective antidote to the threat to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These considerations are all fairly general in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.74,0)">Yet they become especially important if policy rates threaten to become constrained by a lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Even if the policy rate were to be constrained in this way, “flattening the yield curve” by reducing longer-term interest rates would ease monetary conditions if the outlook for price developments required it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In this context, the ability to signal the persistence of policy rate changes is particularly valuable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.23,0)">That being said, I have always stressed that steady-handedness should not be confused with lethargy, incapacity or an unwillingness to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">If the risks to price stability over the medium term change significantly, it is incumbent upon the central bank to ensure that its monetary policy stance is adjusted immediately, in order to address this change in the assessment of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Policy-makers must always be ready to act promptly and decisively when this is required by a change in the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.82,0)">Delay for its own sake is never a good basis for policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.12,0)">Choosing whether to change policy rates requires permanent alertness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.97,0)">If a new threat to price stability emerges, this must be identified promptly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Policy action can then be taken to ensure the achievement of the central bank’s objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">However, in deciding how to adjust the policy stance in order to achieve this goal, conferring persistence on the policy rate may be desirable, to the extent that this maintains and strengthens transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.25,0)">How should such persistence be communicated?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.01,0)">Signalling the persistence of a policy change by stating that the new level of policy rates will be maintained “come what may” is problematic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">An unconditional commitment of this kind runs directly counter to the need to maintain the flexibility to act in response to changing conditions in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.84,0)">A statement of this kind will either   undesirably constrain the ability to respond to new circumstances as they emerge, or   simply be ignored when a new shock occurs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.63,0)">In the case of the former, the policy stance will not be appropriate and price stability will be placed at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.75,0)">In the case of the latter, the reputation and credibility of the central bank will suffer: its communication will be ineffective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Neither outcome is desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.38,0)">This argumentation forms the basis for my oft-repeated statement at the ECB’s monthly press conferences to the effect that the Governing Council “never precommits”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.64,0)">At the same time, avoiding any unconditional commitments does not mean that one cannot communicate as regards the policy outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">On the contrary, it means making a fundamental statement, namely that future decisions will be guided only by the assessment of risks to price stability, without having to announce the level or path of policy interest rates foreseen over the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.89,0)">There appears to be a puzzle here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">At first sight, the need to maintain a readiness to act in the face of changing circumstances appears to run counter to the need for steady-handedness in policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">How can one always stand ready to change policy rates to contain new threats to price stability while simultaneously maintaining a reputation for conferring persistence on developments in interest rates?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">As I argued on a previous occasion here at Jackson Hole, to understand this apparent paradox, we have to assemble not two, but three building blocks providing insight into the ECB’s conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">First, policy decisions focus on the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This supports our credibility, understood in terms of the solid anchoring of private medium and longer-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Second, we behave in a steady-handed manner, conferring persistence on developments in short-term interest rates so as to strengthen the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And third, we are never precommitted as regards the future level or path of policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.52,0)">On the contrary, policy rates are always conditional on the evolution of the outlook for price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">We thereby remain alert and maintain a comprehensive and up-to-date assessment of the economic environment and are always ready to act decisively and promptly if the need arises in order to achieve our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Credibility helps to understand the interplay between alertness – i.e., in particular, the absence of any precommitment – and steady-handedness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It means that there are no question marks regarding the capacity to act with full independence if and when this becomes necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It therefore allows a central bank’s interest rate decisions to have the maximum impact, whatever the circumstances, and helps a central bank to achieve its goal – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">price stability – with a satisfactory degree of economy of means.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Even more importantly, because credibility consolidates the anchoring of inflation expectations, the interplay between steadiness and alertness is self-reinforcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">A posture of permanent alertness relying on the ongoing vigilance of the central bank strengthens the solidity of the anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">And in this perspective, steady-handedness itself appears to be both a consequence as well as a cause of the better anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Not surprisingly, the anchoring of inflation expectations appears to be at the centre of a “virtuous self-reinforcing triangle”, the vertices of which are credibility, alertness and steady-handedness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">A stance of credible alertness is, in my view, one of the most important features of monetary policy in “normal times” – to the extent that the concept of “normal times” has a meaning for central bankers!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is even more useful when we suddenly encounter very exceptional circumstances, as has been the case since mid-2007 and especially since September 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.07,0)">The features of such exceptional circumstances are not only that they occur largely unexpectedly or that they make inference based on past observations inadequate, but also that the complex intertwining of economic relationships characterising this turbulent period can hardly be captured by our mostly linear models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.06,0)">These are times in which the “flap of a butterfly’s wings” causes tornadoes  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Quickly recognizing the limitations of our analytical tools during these episodes is essential in order to avoid making inappropriate decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">One can identify three important reasons for “heightened alertness” in periods of turbulence of the “Lorenzian” type.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Firstly, to the extent that very small initial changes are capable of triggering extremely large changes after a sufficient period of time, it is essential to quickly establish a lucid diagnosis and swiftly take the decisions necessary to avoid as much as possible adverse future developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.12,0)">Secondly, a common feature in the development of highly turbulent episodes is that central banks have to cope with abnormally rapid modifications in the economic and financial environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.65,0)">These changes might be highly unexpected, erratic and trigger abrupt changes in the risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In such exceptional circumstances, credible alertness is vital, and swift decision-making should not be hampered by ex ante considerations other than the delivery of price stability, and, by way of consequence, the anchoring of inflation expectations is of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.48,0)">Indeed – and this is the third reason – the risk of unanchoring inflation expectations, whether upward or downward, is particularly acute in such circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Thus, it is all the more important to make very clear to markets that, ex ante, they can always map the expected path of the policy rates relative to the evolution of macroeconomic conditions on the basis of the unambiguous goal of very solidly anchoring inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Some of these points can be illustrated in the context of the recent financial turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Let us take the decision to increase rates in July 2008, 11 months after the turbulence began in August 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.62,0)">This decision was criticised ex post by some people, particluarly following the intensification of the crisis in mid-September 2008, two and a half months after our decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">I take it that in the perspective of credible alertness, it has been an important and opportune decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The risks to price stability had increased significantly by the end of the first half of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Perhaps paradoxically in a period of financial turbulence, we also saw medium-term inflation expectations beginning to rise, signalling a serious risk of the unanchoring of these expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Our decision demonstrated our determination to continue solidly anchoring inflation expectations including in the turbulent circumstances that we had to cope with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This demonstration of alertness proved extremely useful in the period that followed, after mid-September, when we had to guard against both deflationary risks in the short term and inflationary risks in the medium and longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.9,0)">After the acute intensification of the crisis  , nominal yields at two and three-year maturities fell in the euro area, as shown in Figure This partly reflected private expectations that the cut in policy rates would prove persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">At the same time, as revealed by the developments in break-even rates illustrated in Figure 2, private expectations regarding euro area inflation remained correctly anchored, even at these relatively short horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.8,0)">By implication, real rates at such maturities fell substantially, as shown in Figure To the extent that real rates are the relevant determinant of private spending – as canonical models of transmission would suggest – the evidence points to significant monetary easing in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">This very significant monetary easing was made possible by changes to the policy rate that were of a magnitude permitting us not to run into lower-bound constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.93,0)">Of course, extracting relevant information from financial market prices – as is implicit in these charts – is particularly difficult at times of market turmoil, when liquidity premia and safe-haven effects may be larger than normal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.99,0)">Such caveats imply a need for caution when interpreting these developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Nonetheless, the evidence supports the view that a central bank’s ability to ease monetary conditions – and thereby support the stabilisation of inflation and output – is significantly enhanced by its ability to anchor private expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The effectiveness of the ECB’s interest rate decisions is reflected in the continued credibility of the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Notwithstanding the substantial economic and financial shocks experienced recently in the euro area, longer-term private inflation expectations have remained securely anchored at levels consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.65,0)">By way of illustration, the average private inflation forecast at the six to ten-year horizon   was 1.9% in June 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.18,0)">Ten-year break-even inflation rates derived from indexed bonds also hovered at levels just below 2%  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Even at the peak of the crisis, there was no discernible doubt that the ECB would maintain price stability over the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.02,0)">That being said, it must be stressed that there are at least two important reasons why deflationary risks in the euro area and in other economies have been smaller than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.68,0)">Firstly, the US economy was at the epicentre of the dramatic intensification of the global financial crisis in mid-September last year, and the nature and magnitude of the real economic shocks it had to cope with were formidable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Secondly, the flexibility of the US economy – which is one of its major assets in many respects – also means that very significant price movements, including downward movements, are more conceivable than in many other economies, including the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">I am profoundly convinced that, in these dramatic circumstances, central banks in general, and particularly those on either side of the Atlantic, have demonstrated remarkable unity of purpose and equally remarkable effectiveness in highly adverse circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.55,0)">They did not necessarily take the same decisions, because they were not in the same situation as already pointed out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Also to be mentioned in this respect are the significant differences between the financial structures of the two economies, as highlighted in Figure Non-standard measures: Enhanced credit support I will now turn to the third element of my remarks, concerning the ECB’s enhanced credit support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.37,0)">At times of turmoil and stress – when conventional channels for the transmission of monetary policy are blocked or impaired – central banks may need to act, possibly forcefully, so as to ensure that their policy decisions remain effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Our non-standard measures should be viewed in this light.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">We define “enhanced credit support” as meaning the special and primarily bank-based measures that are being taken to enhance the flow of credit above and beyond what could be achieved through policy interest rate reductions alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">These measures were introduced to complement the reduction of interest rates, with the aim of ensuring that the easing of financial conditions triggered by policy rate cuts was fully transmitted to firms and households at a time of turmoil when financial markets and institutions were not functioning normally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.36,0)">When significant tensions first emerged in the money market in early August 2007, the ECB was in the vanguard of moves to address the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">More specifically, on 9 August – within hours of the tensions first becoming apparent – we conducted a special liquidity operation, providing €95 billion to the market that same day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.61,0)">Other special operations followed in subsequent days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Thus, the ECB was the first central bank to engage in non-standard measures in response to the turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The response was significant and rapid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Better evidence of the ECB’s alertness and readiness to act would be hard to find.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Since then, we have adopted various other non-standard measures with the aim of maintaining the flow of credit to households and companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">These non-standard measures represent our policy of enhanced credit support for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">There are five main elements of this approach:   the introduction of full allotment at fixed rates in the provision of central bank liquidity via Eurosystem operations; the lengthening of the maturity of our operations, which now extend up to one-year operations; the further expansion of the list of assets that we accept as collateral in our operations; the provision of liquidity in foreign currencies, notably US dollars provided by the Federal Reserve; and finally, the purchase of €60 billion of covered bank bonds in order to revive this market segment, which is important in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">I would like to highlight in this context the very close cooperation that has been established between central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.87,0)">Without such trustful cooperation, global events could have been much more dramatic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.3,0)">This is particularly true for the period following the intensification of the crisis in mid-September 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Being in Jackson Hole, it is natural for me to mention very warmly the link established between the Federal Reserve and the ECB to supply foreign exchange on both sides of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">In my view, this cooperation played a very important role in stabilising European financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The set of measures described above has fundamentally eased banks’ liquidity constraints in the euro area, thereby supporting the extension of credit and the rolling over of maturing loans, even in challenging market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">One distinguishing feature of these non-standard measures is their focus on the banking system, reflecting the bank-centric structure of the financial sector in the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The ECB’s approach contributed to contain the rise in money market spreads last autumn, before helping to reduce them substantially thereafter  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.33,0)">However, such measures alone were far from being sufficient in order to normalise conditions in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.64,0)">To the extent that ongoing tensions reflected financial institutions’ need to take into account losses, increase capital and address a general lack of confidence, other public authorities – fiscal authorities, supervisors and regulators – and, ultimately, banks themselves needed to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Further progress in this regard remains urgently required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Against this background, it is crucial that central banks act to build and sustain confidence, which is a scarce commodity in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Policy-makers must always display sang froid – if I may use a French synonym for “steady-handedness” – and keep their composure, particularly in the most demanding and turbulent of times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.01,0)">The design of the ECB’s non-standard measures reflects these concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To the extent possible, they are a continuation of our operational framework prior to the emergence of market turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Moreover, from the outset, they have recognised the need for a credible exit strategy, so as to ensure the independence of the ECB and the credibility of its focus on price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The Governing Council will ensure that the measures taken are quickly unwound and the liquidity provided is absorbed once the macroeconomic environment improves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Concluding remarks The exceptional challenges faced over the past two years have required monetary policy action unprecedented in terms of its nature, scope and magnitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Very demanding circumstances have called for bold – yet solidly anchored – action as events have unfolded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">We believe that what I would call the “virtuous triangle” of credibility, alertness and steady-handedness – jointly serving to solidly anchor inflation expectations – has served us well both in periods of relative calm and in very demanding and challenging uncharted territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Before coming, I read the conclusions I presented here in Jackson Hole exactly four years ago with some anxiety, as you can imagine… I saw that, fortunately, risks ahead had not been omitted: “We have to stand ready at any time to weather the materialisation of new risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Being intellectually and conceptually ready is extremely important.” Now that we have a better idea of the dramatic ways in which risk can materialise in the present global economy, we are all, more than ever, convinced that being “intellectually and conceptually ready” means doing all that we can, in our own area of responsibility, to prevent the repetition of such dramatic events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.37,0)">This is the very demanding immediate task of the international community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.65,0)">And now that we see some signs confirming that the real economy is starting to get out of the period of “free fall” – which does not mean at all that we do not have a very bumpy road ahead of us – the largest mistake we could make would be to forget the importance and the urgency of this task.</span>
