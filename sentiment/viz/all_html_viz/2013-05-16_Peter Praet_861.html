    <span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)"> Adjustment and growth in the euro area Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, European Business Summit, Brussels, 16 May 2013 Introduction   Thank you very much for inviting me to speak at this conference of the European Business Summit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The theme of my address today is ‘Adjustment and Growth in the Euro Area’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.23,0)">This is a title that, to some, may sound contradictory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.11,0)">Many of you will have come across commentators who claim that adjustment is in fact inimical to growth; and that consolidating government budgets while introducing structural reforms is the main cause of our current difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.15,0)">Yet, in my view, this is a short-sighted assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.96,0)">While it is clear that fiscal consolidation has affected economic activity in the euro area in the short-term, it does not follow from this that adjustment and growth are incompatible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Restoring the sustainability of public finances and implementing well-designed structural reforms are key to restoring confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Measures that are now being undertaken help to lay the foundations for future growth and bring back a climate of confidence already in the short-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">First, by prioritising fiscal consolidation, euro area countries can anchor medium-term expectations about public debt sustainability, which is essential to support confidence among investors and taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">As many euro area countries already have high public debt levels, and some have seen their market access threatened, credible fiscal consolidation ensures that debt can be refinanced at affordable rates in the future, and fiscal crises avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.91,0)">Moreover, if consolidation is focused to the greatest extent possible on unproductive expenditure items rather than those, like investment, that are conducive to long-term growth, the negative effects on growth can be contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Second, by implementing structural reforms, euro area countries should raise their future growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Research has shown that a comprehensive package of product and labour market reforms could significantly increase euro area output – by more than 4.5% over 5 years, according to a recent IMF study.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This improved outlook, when incorporated into medium-term expectations, should encourage forward-looking firms to increase investment, and could hence lead to higher growth also in the short-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Such reforms should be undertaken with due protection of the most vulnerable members of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">The key point is that for adjustment and growth to be mutually supportive, the commitment to reform has to be credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Investors, firms and households have to be convinced beyond doubt that governments will stay the course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.83,0)">If they fear policy commitments may be delayed or reversed in the future, they will neither be sufficiently confident in the sustainability of public finances nor in future growth potential to alter their behaviour today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">“Wait-and-see” will remain the rational response and short-term growth will lag behind potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.42,0)">In other words, proposing to reverse course on fiscal and structural reforms does not support growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.92,0)">In fact, it only weakens credibility and hence undermines the hard work that has already been done to put the euro area on a surer footing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">For the remainder of my remarks, I would like to first review the ongoing process of adjustment across the euro area and what has been done by national authorities, and the ECB acting within its price stability mandate, to facilitate that process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Thereafter, I will put forward some suggestions for what remains to be done by euro area governments to ensure a return to growth as speedily as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Restoring growth and employment in the euro area Let me begin by reviewing the economic situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.16,0)">Euro area real GDP still remains about three percentage points below its pre-crisis peak, although this aggregate figure hides some divergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.12,0)">For the group of countries which are still under some financial stress  , real GDP remains near the trough of the crisis reached in 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Other euro area countries, however, had by 2011 already recovered the previous maximum level of real GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.31,0)">The same is true of labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.22,0)">The employment rate in the euro area as a whole is still more than two percentage points below its peak, according to OECD figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.4,0)">However, Germany has increased its employment rate by more than three percentage points   while, at the other extreme, Greece has seen its employment rate dropping by more than ten percentage points  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.37,0)">Youth unemployment rates in a number of stressed countries also remain unacceptably high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Looking forward, we expect the euro area economy to resume growth at a modest pace later in 2013, although it will take more time for this to feed through into higher employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Why is growth not rebounding more quickly and evenly across the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.85,0)">A key explanation is that the adjustment process has been hindered by adverse feedback loops resulting from the interaction of accumulated fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances, weak bank balance sheets and the lack of a genuinely European approach to bank resolution and recapitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.65,0)">To give just one example of such interactions, large fiscal imbalances in a Member State can lead financial markets to drive up yields on its sovereign debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.28,0)">This in turn creates higher funding costs for its domestic banks and reduces their profitability, thereby hampering credit growth to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.15,0)">Lower credit growth then contributes to lower nominal GDP, which not only further weakens banks’ balance sheets by increasing non-performing loans, but also increases concerns about the sustainability of sovereign debt through the denominator effect; and thus, the feedback loop restarts again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.44,0)">Without a European approach to banking sector repair, if the sovereign intervenes to break the feedback loop by recapitalising or resolving banks, it may only heighten market concerns about its debt sustainability and aggravate the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">a.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Actions by governments Addressing such adverse feedback loops between government finances, credit and growth implies a triple policy response from governments: First, fiscal consolidation and current account rebalancing to secure public debt sustainability and lower external financing needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Second, structural reforms to increase potential growth and offset the potential negative effects of fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Third, comprehensive banking sector repair to acknowledge impaired assets and strengthen bank balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Fortunately, in all three areas the euro area is heading in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.1,0)">First, fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances have improved significantly: fiscal deficits have declined from their 2009 peaks throughout the euro area based on sizeable consolidation efforts and despite strong economic headwinds, while there has been a pronounced reduction of current account deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">However, these sizeable flow adjustments have not yet fully translated into improvements in the accumulated stock of imbalances – public debt ratios on the fiscal side, net international investment positions on the macroeconomic side – because of depressed nominal GDP growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Most EU countries made significant progress towards further reducing budgetary imbalances in 2012, in an environment of weaker than expected output growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.75,0)">The euro area government deficit has decreased to 3.7% of GDP  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">In 2013, the Commission expects the euro area deficit to reach 2.9% of GDP – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.41,0)">below the Maastricht reference value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This level would be less than half the peak reached in 2009  , and it puts the euro area as a whole on track to comply with the commitment made by G-20 leaders in Toronto in 2010 to halve fiscal deficits by 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">It has to be stressed that correcting for the effects of the weak cycle the fiscal adjustment has been even larger than suggested by these figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Progress with fiscal consolidation has been particularly strong in countries subject to an economic adjustment programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.62,0)">The primary structural deficit   as a ratio of GDP over the period 2009-2012 has fallen by around 14 percentage points in Greece, 6 percentage points in Portugal and 4 percentage points in Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.1,0)">The true adjustment effort is likely to have been even larger than these numbers suggest due to significant revenue shortfalls in a context of rebalancing from   domestic demand towards   exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This rebalancing has also been associated with significant improvements in current account positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.55,0)">Current account deficits fell on average by 10 percentage points of GDP in Greece, Ireland and Portugal from 2008-2012, and by 8 percentage points of GDP in Spain over the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Second, the euro area witnessed a renewed momentum to implement structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">It has been well-understood by euro area countries that restoring fiscal sustainability must rest not only on fiscal adjustment to achieve sizeable primary surpluses, but also on measures to revive growth to avoid adverse snowball effects undoing the debt-stabilising impact of primary surpluses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This requires structural reforms that improve labour market and product market functioning and hence increase potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">There are numerous studies, for instance by the OECD and the IMF, showing the significant benefits in terms of employment and growth that could accrue to the euro area from such measures – and not only in the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">A credible commitment by euro area governments to implement structural reforms could already create a permanent upward shift in expectations of future growth, improve labour market performance, and as a welcome side-effect, improve the health of public finances over the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And to a certain extent, this is what we are seeing in the euro area today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">As regards labour market reforms, several euro area countries have moved towards a negotiating framework for wages and working conditions based more on firm-level agreements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">This should enhance competitiveness by promoting a closer link between wages and productivity and, at the same time, allow firms to rapidly adjust their internal organisation of labour and production in response to changing economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In addition, labour market functioning has been strengthened by addressing distortions related to the ‘two-tier’ systems that characterise a number of euro area economies – in particular Spain and Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">These measures should support social fairness by bringing to an end the situation where vulnerable temporary workers, mainly young people, de facto bear the full burden of the adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Moreover, they should increase potential growth by improving the employment conditions of young workers and their relatively lower opportunities for on-the-job training, which significantly hampers human capital formation; and by reducing inefficient labour turnover, since firms would be less reluctant to transform temporary jobs into permanent ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">At the same time, to reduce unemployment traps and create incentives for job-seeking, welfare systems are being reformed so as to shift from a system providing security “on the job” to one providing income support “in the market”, while setting up strict eligibility criteria and a system of active labour market policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Together with these labour market measures, reform efforts have focused on increasing competition in a number of sectors, including retail and wholesale, transport, energy, and professional services; reducing the administrative requirements to set up or expand businesses; and improving the efficiency of civil justice and public administration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Third, euro area countries have taken a series of measures to address balance sheet weaknesses in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Capital requirements are in the process of being strengthened following the conclusion of the Capital Requirements IV Directive, which transposes the Basel III agreement into EU law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">At the same time, a number of banks raised new capital to address balance sheet weaknesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The greatest progress in financial sector repair has of course taken place in the countries under EU-IMF programmes, where there has been a comprehensive restructuring and recapitalisation of the domestic banking sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Spain has also taken decisive measures to address the imbalances of the past via its ESM indirect bank recapitalisation programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">b.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.82,0)">Actions by the ECB What is the role of the ECB in this process?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">While the ECB has consistently played its part and maintained price stability in the euro area, it is important to keep in mind that the role that the central bank can play in terms of crisis resolution is limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy can only play a crisis mitigation role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Hence, our monetary policy approach has focused on providing liquidity support, intended to relieve banks of liquidity and funding stress by giving them unlimited access to central bank money at a fixed price against adequate collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">To facilitate this support, we expanded the set of eligible assets that can be used as collateral and extended the maturity of our lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">It is widely recognised that these measures have been effective in averting a disorderly spiral of deleveraging in the banking system, which would have taken place in an environment of severe liquidity constraints and fire sales.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">This was necessary in order to avoid deflationary downward pressures that would have prevented us from delivering on our mandate of preserving price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.42,0)">However, to mitigate the crisis we have also had to go beyond liquidity support, in particular to counter financial fragmentation in the euro area – created by the adverse feedback loops I described above – that was disrupting the transmission of monetary policy across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.89,0)">Diverging credit conditions by countries, by sectors and by size of companies have prevented the ECB’s very accommodative monetary policy stance from being passed on evenly in the financing conditions faced by euro area firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.06,0)">As the euro area economy relies heavily on bank credit, this has serious implications for growth and ultimately for our ability to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.7,0)">In particular, in the first half of last year we perceived a situation last year where severe upward pressure on sovereign yields was being driven by unfounded fears about the future of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.34,0)">These fears were causing investors to charge risk premia to lend to some Member States that could not be justified by economic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We therefore decided to open the possibility of undertaking Outright Monetary Transactions  , entailing ex ante unlimited interventions in short- to medium-term securities issued by governments which have submitted to strict and effective conditionality, in order to eliminate the pricing of un-warranted tail risks in the bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">This has played an important role in reducing financial market fragmentation, as financial markets understood OMTs as a credible backstop for countering redenomination risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.04,0)">What remains to be done These measures by the ECB, however, can only buy time; they cannot substitute for the responsibilities of national governments to address the unsound fiscal, economic and financial policies that are the root causes of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">And while a great deal has already been done by euro area authorities to address these root causes, there are three areas in which more progress still needs to be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">First, the euro area needs to continue to deepen structural reforms aimed at enhancing competition, flexibility, efficiency, and productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The reform process takes time, and so a medium-term, comprehensive approach is crucial to anchor expectations and maximise the positive effects of adjustment in the short-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The greatest challenge today is to maintain reform momentum and implement fully those changes which have already been announced or even enacted into law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Concretely, this means, for the labour markets, addressing the remaining insider-outsider dualities and enhancing labour mobility, including across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">For product markets, the key challenge is to open up regulated professions and network industries that are sheltered from competition by government regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">This requires a simplification and streamlining of regulations, a reduction of barriers to entry and limits to competition, a resolute deepening of the Single Market in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Going forward, structural reforms also need to go into the government sector itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">In several euro area countries, modernisation of public administration is essential to increase efficiency in the provision of public goods, like infrastructure, and essential services, like civil justice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">This will also support fiscal consolidation, by reducing the size of the government sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Second, the euro area needs to persevere in fiscal consolidation efforts and reduce steadily the government debt ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.84,0)">Despite the important progress on fiscal consolidation, debt ratios have yet failed to stabilise in most euro area countries, as improvements in primary balances were outweighed by the debt-rising impact of unfavourable developments in interest-growth differentials and deficit-debt adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The euro area government debt ratio is projected to rise further to above 95% of GDP in 2013 – far above the 60% Maastricht reference value – with debt ratios displaying large differences across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.33,0)">Further adjustment is thus inevitable, and unfortunately it must take place in an environment of rising consolidation fatigue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Five years into the crisis this rise in consolidation fatigue is understandable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Going forward, it will be important for policymakers to communicate effectively both on the need for further adjustment and how this adjustment will be distributed in an equitable way across different groups of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In this context, it is necessary to review consolidation strategies that have relied predominantly on tax rate increases, exacerbating the burden on already compliant taxpayers, without much broadening of the tax bases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.67,0)">Such an approach has had substantial negative effects on disposable income and demand, at the same time raising resistance and negative reactions in the electorate, based on inter-temporal uncertainty and fairness considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Due protection of the most vulnerable is needed here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.41,0)">On the expenditure side, adjustment has relied disproportionally on cuts in government investment, thereby weakening the prospects for long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Going forward, there is a need to focus adjustment on unproductive expenditure while as far as possible safeguarding government expenditure that is conducive to long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Third, the euro area needs to press ahead with constructing a genuine Banking Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">A first and important step has been made with the decision to create the Single Supervisory Mechanism  , the responsibility for which was assigned to the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Political agreement by the ECOFIN Council and the European Parliament was reached on a legislative package in March, and technical agreement is expected very soon, so that national parliamentary proceedings can start, which should be concluded by the summer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The existence of the SSM, by reducing regulatory capture and increasing supervisory consistency and coherence, should play an important role in increasing confidence in the overall euro area banking system, and as a result, reduce fragmentation of interbank and other financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">However, for the Banking Union to be fully effective, a Single Resolution Mechanism   to accompany the SSM is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is the case for a number of reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">First, an SRM would allow for the euro area to complete the process of banking sector repair without aggravating market concerns over public debt sustainability, which would help break the adverse feedback loop I described above and restore the functioning of the credit channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Second, this confidence in EU level resolution capacity would ensure that the SSM can be a credible supervisor, as it would be able to push non-viable banks towards winding down without endangering financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Third, an SRM would facilitate speedy and effective resolution of large and complex cross-border banks, removing the need for drawn-out and inefficient cooperation between multiple national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">To generate these benefits, in our view the SRM must be built around a Single Resolution Authority and a European Resolution Fund..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Conclusion Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The ongoing process of adjustment in the euro area, if persevered with, will create a path out of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">There is no doubt that this path is a challenging one, as it depends on deep-rooted reforms to the structure of the euro area’s economies, and these require courage to implement and a willingness to confront vested interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">But it is critical that governments stay the course, as this will allow the confidence effects of a brighter outlook to start being felt already in the short-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">For its part, the ECB will continue to fulfil its mandate to maintain price stability, and to use its standard and non-standard measures to support the flow of credit to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">But one must also recognise the limits to what we as the central bank can achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.31,0)">We cannot remove barriers to bank lending that stem from insufficient capital or lack of bank repair: these can only be addressed by governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">This is why establishing a Banking Union with a strong Single Resolution Mechanism is a priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">I am glad that the elements of a Banking Union are beginning to fall into place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">A swift implementation of the remaining elements is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Significant progress has been made on fiscal consolidation and structural reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Looking ahead, credibility is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Therefore, I welcome the stronger rules for fiscal and macroeconomic policies like the Fiscal Compact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">All these ongoing important adjustment efforts in the euro area should restore confidence in the short-term and lead steadily back to sustainable growth.</span>
