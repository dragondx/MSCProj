    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)"> Keynote address at the New Year's reception of the International Club of Economic Journalists by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt am Main, 14 January 2002 Thank you very much for inviting me to participate in today's New Year reception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In my speech today, I will address two issues, neither of which is likely to come as a surprise to you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, I should like to assess the euro cash changeover, which started a fortnight ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Second, I should like to share with you the view of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank   on recent monetary and economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">A first assessment of the euro cash changeover On 1 January 1999 the euro was established as a new currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Two weeks ago, the euro banknotes and coins were issued and became legal tender in the countries participating in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">With their arrival, the process of introducing a single European currency, as agreed in Maastricht in 1991, is complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Paying with a single currency in daily transactions throughout the euro area can be regarded as an achievement of historic proportions and as a major step in the process of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The Eurosystem, the ECB and the 12 national central banks   of the euro area as well as all other parties involved were quite confident – although of course not 100% certain – that the euro cash changeover would be a success, given the enormous efforts and preparations which went into this unprecedented operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Now, two weeks after the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins, I can even say that, given the scale of the task, the operation has so far progressed very smoothly, even beyond our own expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.24,0)">Here and there some minor mishaps have occurred and may continue to occur, but this is quite normal for such a massive operation, involving more than 300 million people in 12 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The introduction of euro banknotes and coins has been a complex and ambitious undertaking which requires – in addition to understanding and co-operation on the part of the public – organisational, logistical, technical and economic efforts on the part of those sectors directly involved in the use of banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">I should like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude to all these parties, such as retailers, the vending machine industry, cash-in-transit companies and, of course, the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">But the media has also been accompanying the changeover in a very positive, informative and supportive manner, thus helping us to convey certain messages to the citizens of the euro area as to how they can contribute to a successful operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">At the end of the day, the success of the euro cash changeover depends not only on the co-operation of all professional parties directly involved, but also on a favourable attitude and quick acceptance by the citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Therefore, I should also like to express my gratitude to the media for their efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Let me now mention some of the other factors which have contributed to the success of the euro cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, in March last year the Governing Council of the ECB established the Cash Changeover Co-ordination Committee   comprising representatives from the ECB, the 12 NCBs of the euro area, the European Commission and Europol.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The Committee has overall responsibility for the co-ordination of the changeover to euro banknotes and coins from the period before 1 January 2002 until the end of February 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Second, measures were taken to ensure an early return of national banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.27,0)">As regards the return of legacy currency coins, most national authorities reduced the work for banks during the dual circulation period either by encouraging the public to deposit hoarded coins at banks' counters early on, or through a range of charity schemes introduced in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">With regard to national banknotes, there was also a return of hoarded banknotes, particularly high denominations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,7.99,0)">In total, legacy currency banknotes in circulation fell during the course of the year by EUR 110 billion to EUR 270 billion at the end of 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Third, a crucial factor for the success of the euro cash changeover was the decision to allow the frontloading and sub-frontloading of banknotes and coins to the banking sector and to other target groups from 1 September 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This four-month lead time was required in order to ensure that sufficient euro banknotes and coins were available for widespread circulation from 1 January 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.76,0)">In fact, the scale and timing of frontloading and sub-frontloading varied considerably between different countries, depending on the national changeover scenario chosen, the national infrastructure   as well as the size and geography of the country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.65,0)">In almost all euro area countries the national authorities provided euro coins to credit institutions from September 2001 because their bulk made them more difficult to transport and their lower value meant that the risk to credit institutions was lower than for banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.33,0)">Five countries   started frontloading banknotes at the same time; the remaining seven countries postponed the distribution of banknotes until November and December 2001 in most cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">All countries supplied credit institutions and the retail sector with both euro banknotes and coins prior to 1 January 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.52,0)">The participation of retailers in sub-frontloading operations varied by country, sector and region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As regards the cash-operated machine industry, and in view of the need to load machines with coins prior to €-Day, most all euro countries sub-frontloaded euro coins to this sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">By the end of 2001, more than 6.5 billion euro banknotes worth some EUR 134 billion and more than 37.5 billion euro coins with a total value of around EUR 12.4 billion had been frontloaded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">This meant that around 70% of the banknotes and 80% of the coins were already distributed to banks before 1 January, which was decisive for a smooth start to the changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Broadly speaking, sub-frontloading was also in line with the initial forecasts and represented an overall amount of between 10% and 20% of the frontloaded amount.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">According to the ECOFIN Council statement made in November 1999, euro coins were allowed to be provided to the general public from mid-December 2001 in order to ensure the citizens' familiarity with euro coins and to reduce the stocks needed by retailers to provide change at the beginning of 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The citizens of the euro area were very quick to buy one or more coin sets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Overall, the general public acquired more than 150 million coin starter kits comprising over 4.2 billion coins worth EUR 1.6 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.67,0)">This means that on average each individual was in possession of 14 coins at the beginning of 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In a number of countries  , demand was such that banks were authorised to make up their own kits and even to sell some of their bulk stocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Fourth, given that in terms of transactions around 70% of banknotes are put into circulation via automated teller machines  , the quick adaptation of these machines was one of the key factors for a smooth changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.36,0)">In total, more than 200,000 ATMs, either on site in bank branches or off site, for example in shopping centres, had to be converted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This was already achieved within less than one week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As a result, in all participating Member States the bulk of cash transactions could already be made in euro after 10 days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This means that the euro banknotes and coins have been introduced considerably faster than originally foreseen by the ECOFIN Council, which had set a goal of two weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">A fifth factor contributing to a smooth changeover was the commitment of the banking sector in almost all euro area countries to put, in particular, the low denomination euro banknotes   into circulation on a large scale at the beginning of 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This considerably reduced the need for retailers to hold large amounts of cash during the first few days of 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In those euro area countries one or both of the low denomination euro banknotes were dispensed via at least part of the ATM network at the start of 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.94,0)">In countries where welfare payments are paid largely in cash  , this was also done in low denominations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.58,0)">Moreover, banks paid out predominantly low denomination euro banknotes over the counter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">All this resulted at the beginning of the year in a circulation of low denomination banknotes   of 82.4% in terms of actual banknotes and 43% in value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">This far exceeded the proportion of national banknotes of similar value previously in circulation in the individual euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">In conclusion, the Eurosystem is proud of and grateful to all those involved for their contributions to this historic moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The enthusiasm of the citizens of the euro area to get hold of euro cash from mid-December can be seen as a clear vote for a united Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">I am very confident that the changeover will proceed to its completion as smoothly and successfully as it has started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Recent monetary and macroeconomic developments Let me now turn to the macroeconomic situation in the euro area and the outlook for price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.35,0)">Recent information has confirmed the Governing Council's earlier assessment that economic activity in the euro area was weak in the second half of 2001 and will probably remain subdued in early 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">However, although the outlook is still surrounded by a high degree of uncertainty, there are indications pointing to a gradual economic recovery in the euro area in the course of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.91,0)">This is signalled, inter alia, by financial market developments and by recent survey data, which indicate that the decline in confidence in the euro area may have bottomed out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Indeed, the conditions exist for economic growth in the euro area to recover in the course of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">There are no fundamental imbalances in the euro area that would require a prolonged correction process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In addition, financing conditions in the euro area are favourable, as real and nominal short-term and long-term interest rates are currently at very low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Furthermore, the expected further decline in consumer price inflation in 2002 will lead to higher growth in real disposable income that should support domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.64,0)">Inflation rates have been falling significantly over recent months, from a peak of 3.4% in March 2001 to a level, according to the Eurostat flash estimate, of 2% in December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.07,0)">This downward path in annual inflation rates, which stems mainly from the unwinding of past increases in energy prices and from base effects related to past increases in food prices, is likely to continue for some months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.1,0)">However, mainly on account of base effects, the pattern of annual inflation rates may be somewhat erratic in the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.8,0)">In this regard, the possibility of some short-lived upward movements in the annual rate of inflation cannot be ruled out, but this should not be a cause for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.29,0)">Likewise, downward shifts resulting from such base effects later in the spring should not signal a change in the longer-term outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Concerning the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, which I have just talked about at length, there is a lot of talk by the public and the media about the potential inflation effects stemming from rounding towards psychologically attractive prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">But we should expect such rounding to be in both directions, up and down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.41,0)">In fact, although many had feared anticipatory effects on inflation rates already in 2001, there has been little evidence so far of the changeover affecting the average level of prices, and we do not expect any noticeable effect on the average price level in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">This is largely due to strong competition in the retail sector, continued awareness on the part of consumers and the commitment of governments not to increase the average level of administered prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, we will of course remain vigilant with regard to the possibility, albeit remote, of an impact on inflation rates in the first months of this year as a consequence of the introduction of euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Looking beyond short-term developments, we assume that wage moderation in the euro area will continue and that the pressure of demand on prices will remain limited, although there is some cause for concern about forthcoming wage negotiations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">It is therefore particularly important to point to the indispensable role of continued wage moderation in fostering employment and maintaining a favourable outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Finally, I should also emphasise that we do not regard recent monetary developments as posing a risk to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Although the annual growth rates of M3 have picked up significantly in recent months, we need to keep in mind that this happened in an economic and financial environment characterised by exceptionally high uncertainty throughout the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It can therefore be assumed that this growth to a large extent reflects the risk aversion of investors who wish to "wait and see" – and therefore hold liquid and safe assets included in M3 – before again undertaking long-term investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In this sense, this increase in M3 should remain temporary and should not indicate future inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This notwithstanding, the continued acceleration of M3 and the ongoing build-up of liquidity calls for close attention and will require a thorough analysis of monetary developments in the months to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.9,0)">Overall, we do not currently see any major risks to price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In fact, following a series of unexpected sectoral price shocks, the outlook for price stability significantly improved in the course of 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.32,0)">The Governing Council reacted to this in a forward-looking manner by reducing the key ECB interest rates by a total of 150 basis points in 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.86,0)">On the basis of current information, our assessment is that annual inflation rates should fall safely below 2% this year and thereafter remain at levels consistent with price stability over the foreseeable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Against this background, the Governing Council of the ECB concluded at its last meeting that it considers the current level of key ECB interest rates to be consistent with the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The best contribution monetary policy can make to sustainable and non-inflationary economic growth is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">In this respect, I would also like to reiterate how important it is for fiscal policies to maintain a medium-term orientation within the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.51,0)">We are well aware that the current weakness in economic growth presents a particular challenge for those countries which have not yet attained budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus or which have high public debt-to-GDP ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Nonetheless, it is important to realise that, rather than being detrimental to a return to sustainable economic growth, the adherence of these countries to their medium-term consolidation programmes will strengthen consumer and investor confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.52,0)">Any deviation from the medium-term orientation could thus only prove counterproductive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Countries without fiscal imbalances can, of course, allow automatic stabilisers to operate fully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, there is no case for fiscal activism in any country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">The only way to continue to expand the rate of non-inflationary output growth of the economy in a decisive and long-lasting manner is to deepen structural reform in the labour and goods markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Efforts have been made in this direction in many euro area countries over recent years, but there is still some way to go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">In the same vein, governments should pursue determined reforms with regard to the size and structure of public expenditure and revenue, also in order to create room for further tax cuts and to absorb the fiscal costs of population ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Together with continued wage moderation aimed at sustaining recent labour market gains, these reforms will foster employment and investment, and ultimately contribute in a decisive manner to making the euro a resounding and long-lasting success, underpinned by a stable and dynamic economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">I am confident that the importance of this moment and the need to act resolutely is well understood by policy-makers all over Europe.</span>
