    <h1> Advancing Monetary Union </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Euro Exhibition Osnabrück, 25 January 2015 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)"> Advancing Monetary Union Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Euro Exhibition Osnabrück, 25 January 2015 Ladies and gentlemen, Euro banknotes and coins are not just a means of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The bridges and arches on our banknotes are a symbol of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">They stand for the fact that there is a lot which connects us within the Monetary Union, and that our once so divided continent has succeeded in overcoming these deep divisions, as the crisis has recently shown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Our common currency also therefore stands for shared values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">“Stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities” have been some of the accession criteria for membership of the EU since the European Council in Copenhagen in June 1993; “Membership presupposes the candidate's ability to take on the obligations of membership including adherence to the aims of political, economic and monetary union.”   The recently published legal opinion of the Advocate General of the European Court of Justice in the case of Peter Gauweiler and the Die Linke party against the ECB on the Outright Monetary Transactions   programme also refers to these constitution-like shared legal values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This “constitutional compact” underlies European integration and includes the German constitutional principle of constitutional identity review – it does not exclude it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Recent expressions of solidarity from all over Europe following the barbaric terrorist attacks on staff at the satirical magazine “Charlie Hebdo” in Paris show what a central role the rights to freedom of speech and freedom of expression occupy in our system of values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">These values of freedom are central among those accorded great importance in newer Member States from the former Eastern bloc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">With the awareness that the common currency within the EU is evidence of closer integration, the introduction of the euro – especially in countries such as Lithuania most recently – is also perceived as a demarcation from, and protection against, purportedly aggressive hegemonic powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This shows that the European Union and the euro area are far more than an amalgamation of independent nation states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.21,0)">Shared values are all the more important when the cement that typically holds together the parts of a full political union is missing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.36,0)">Alongside a shared identity – a loose concept which has sometimes been maliciously abused in the past, yet one which cannot merely be reduced to a successful football team – or language, this is often long-term transfer payments to even out differences in living conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Germany has this in the form of horizontal financial equalisation among the federal states  , as well as transfer payments to the states of former East Germany, which are financed by the solidarity surcharge  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">It may well be that one day the political will considers fiscal transfers between the Member States of the euro area necessary and desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.38,0)">However, that would then require a change to the European treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There is no provision for a transfer union in the current Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.66,0)">And whether you like it or not, that applies to the front door as well as the back door.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">This is something which those who call for more   solidarity must realise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">More solidarity within Europe in this sense would also require more European control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But we don’t yet have a “euro area parliament” with the democratic legitimation for this, or a supranational budget worthy of this name.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.85,0)">At the moment I see correspondingly little willingness from national parliaments to relinquish their budgetary powers in order to centralise them at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.08,0)">The flipside of this coin, however, is that Member States, with their own national budgets, have disproportionately more individual responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Even without financial transfers, there must be reasons why it is more attractive for Member States to be part of the Monetary Union than to stay outside it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.53,0)">In addition, they must be better off in the euro area than out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In concrete terms, membership of the euro should bring more stability and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">In this respect, the Monetary Union has already taken considerable steps towards integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">But a common internal market and a single monetary policy alone is not enough to achieve this in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">With stricter budgetary rules for euro area countries, a stability mechanism and banking union, the Monetary Union is in a considerably better position today that it was at the start of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But despite these steps towards integration we still can’t speak of a completed Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.13,0)">To sit back now, given what has been achieved, would therefore be wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Developing the Monetary Union further is a permanent undertaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As a matter of principle, the prosperity of each individual country in a monetary union always depends on the financial and economic policies of the other Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Member States find themselves, as it were, in a community with a shared destiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">All governments are therefore well advised if they take the other Member States into account and coordinate their policies where appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Member States thus not only need a common monetary policy, they also profit when they share more sovereignty in other policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.99,0)">When I talk about “sharing sovereignty”, this in no way means that Member States lose their independent decision-making authority, let alone their national identity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.79,0)">On the contrary, the more sovereignty Member States share, the more influence they can sometimes gain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me illustrate this with an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Last year Lithuania’s finance minister, Rimantas Šadžius, reportedly said, “we already have the euro, it just has a different name”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">What he wanted to express by that was that Lithuania’s monetary policy was significantly shaped by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.71,0)">From 2002 the litas was pegged to the exchange rate of the euro, and before that to the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">On Thursday Vitas Vasiliauskas, Chairman of the Board of Lietuvos bankas, was allowed to have a say for the first time in the monetary policy of the second-largest economy in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In times of highly interdependent national economies, sharing sovereignty means gaining influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">And precisely this common decision-making for the benefit of all is a prerequisite for Monetary Union being able to bring its members more stability and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This is particularly true when it comes to creating a single European financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is this aspect which I would like to go into in more detail today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.56,0)">At the moment, as a logical consequence of the banking union created last year, a capital markets union is under discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Why Europe needs a capital markets union Europe’s economy is characterised by small and medium-sized enterprises  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">They account for two out of three jobs and generate around 60% of value added.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And precisely these enterprises finance themselves almost exclusively via the domestic banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In most countries, however, the majority of loans to enterprises are granted by only a few banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.08,0)">That makes the economy vulnerable towards, and dependent on, this sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the United States, on the other hand, it is quite usual for enterprises to obtain money directly from the capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.44,0)">And not necessarily in the state in which they have their headquarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">This form of corporate financing makes the economy much less vulnerable towards any problems in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.19,0)">It is, however, significantly underdeveloped in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In a monetary union one should also expect a fully integrated capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">That would mean, for example, that a creditworthy entrepreneur from Osnabrück could issue a bond without any problems in the Netherlands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Or an entrepreneur from Lisbon could do the same in France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">After all, France, Portugal, the Netherlands, Germany and 15 other countries share the same currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">A truly integrated capital market would not only benefit the European economy because it would ensure an efficient and location-independent allocation of financial resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">It would also bring with it a greater distribution of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">First, spreading risk means striving for a balanced financing mix.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.28,0)">If Europe’s enterprises do not principally finance themselves with bank loans but also with, for example, corporate bonds, the economy can still prosper when banks are rather hesitant in their lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.2,0)">Currently in Europe, however, only around 20-25% of debt financing takes place in capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">By comparison, in the United States it is around 80%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Now, we cannot expect to have a completely new financing mix in Europe from one day to the next.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">That is why a healthy banking sector remains a prerequisite for SMEs to be able to access loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Over the medium to long term, however, the desire is not to have to rely on this sector alone, but to foster alternative methods of financing, for example by appropriately regulating the securitisation market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Second, spreading risk means that financial markets within a monetary union should actually function independently of national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Economic shocks can then be better absorbed because countries receive a certain amount of protection from the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">If, for example, part of a country’s assets are held by foreign investors, these investors will also bear a share of the consequences of an economic shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.6,0)">Such shocks thus have a reduced impact on the domestic economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">A country can also reduce its vulnerability to shocks by holding a geographically diversified portfolio itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Ultimately, integrated financial markets help to cushion national shocks because companies and consumers can also fall back on foreign capital markets and banks in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Such risk-sharing with the private sector works very well In the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.15,0)">According to scientific estimates, around two-thirds of an economic shock are smoothed by capital and credit markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.66,0)">The European financial markets are much less effective at absorbing such shocks and their ability to do so deteriorated even further during the course of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The design of a capital markets union – regulatory harmonisation and institutional efficiency The Commission will soon present a first proposal on what a capital markets union could look like in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This proposal will then be submitted for public consultation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The details are not yet known, but I would like to share with you some of my ideas about an effective capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For me, the term “capital markets union” means more than simply tinkering with existing regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It means addressing areas that are politically sensitive as well, such as disclosure requirements for companies, supervision of the financial infrastructure, insolvency law and EU-wide harmonisation of capital gains tax regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">We have already achieved a great deal in the field of payment systems, having broken down barriers and significantly reduced costs for citizens since we introduced the Single Euro Payments Area  , although the existing legislation now needs to be implemented with full force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We want to do the same in the medium term for the cross-border use of credit cards: in a monetary union, there should be no “roaming” fees when it comes to making payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The basic principle of the free movement of capital goes back to the Treaty of Rome   and has enjoyed the same status as the other fundamental freedoms since the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">I think it is time that we consider what regulatory and institutional adjustments have become necessary since then so that we can take full advantage of the single capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Turning first to the regulatory dimension, let’s stick with our example of the entrepreneur in Osnabrück.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">If his company wishes to issue a bond in the Netherlands, it will agree with the investor whether the transaction is to be carried out under German or Dutch law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This initially sounds like a relatively simple way to conduct cross-border financial transactions despite divergent national legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.96,0)">However, financial transactions are often far more complex than that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.62,0)">There might be an entire chain of financial intermediaries, meaning that it is not clear for the final buyer what his/her legal claims and property rights are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.02,0)">The account holder’s legal position from the moment a security is posted to his/her account varies substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In some countries, the account holder has full and undivided ownership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.37,0)">In other countries, he/she has an “inferior” legal position, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.7,0)">he/she holds an indirect interest in a property or just a claim against the account provider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">At the turn of this century, a group of financial market experts, led by Alberto Giovannini, developed a number of suggestions as to how greater harmonisation in the EU financial markets could be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">In two reports  , representatives of the private sector, the European Commission and the European Central Bank presented concrete recommendations on how, for example, regulatory barriers could be broken down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.32,0)">Almost 12 years have now passed since the second report was published and some of these proposals and recommendations have still not been implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.18,0)">For example, we still do not have an EU-wide framework for the treatment of interests in securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Drawing once more on the comparison with the United States, a cross-border securities transaction costs at least ten times as much in Europe as it does in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">I think that makes it clear that Europe’s economy has a lot to gain from dismantling the relevant regulatory barriers as part of a capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">In addition to harmonised regulation for securities, we should also seek to implement a harmonised legal framework for crisis management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The Council Regulation on cross-border insolvency proceedings has provided a common regulatory framework governing, for example, jurisdictions and the recognition of court judgements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.45,0)">But within this framework, there are substantial national differences, such as regarding the extent to which various stakeholders are protected in the event of an insolvency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In my view, a single resolution framework for non-banks, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">central counterparties  ), is also part of a capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">We should also have a comprehensive resolution regime for central securities depositories   in order to level the playing field for banks and non-banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.57,0)">Those are just a couple of examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">In general, what is important is that financial market regulation be harmonised so that a single European capital market can function smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.99,0)">It is very important to keep in mind that harmonisation and standardisation are not the same thing as seeing everything at par or interfering with cultural identities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">You can use a computer in any of the Member States and the connections are configured in such a way that I can exchange keyboards with different language layouts without any problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This technical standardisation does not therefore stand in the way of language diversity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.46,0)">But harmonised regulation alone is not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We also need institutional adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">If – as in the case of the capital markets union – regulation is to be implemented and applied so that the same conditions prevail throughout the whole EU, then there are, in my view, two main approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.85,0)">The first is where the legislator creates strict rules that leave no room for interpretation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">They can then be implemented and applied in a decentralised manner, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">at national level, with the result that institutional adjustments are not essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Alternatively, the legislator may wish to draw up more flexible regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In this case, a supranational authority would be needed to ensure that this regulation is interpreted and applied in the same way across all Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Finding this balance between discretionary powers and centralisation comes to the fore, for example, in the context of supervision of securities markets, instruments and market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.73,0)">Day-to-day supervision is currently largely done at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We should consider whether this is still appropriate and what role the European supervisory authorities will play in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.38,0)">Their tasks and responsibilities are currently being reviewed in Brussels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Closing remarks As you see, the capital markets union is a bigger project that cannot be implemented overnight, not to mention the progress that is still needed in terms of integration in other political areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.58,0)">But this should not discourage us from getting started on it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.93,0)">Political scientists would tell you that it is completely normal that we didn’t have a fully accomplished currency union from day one and that we still don’t have it today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Hardly any international agreement was as ambitious at the first attempt as some of the negotiators would have perhaps liked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The United States also needed many decades and went through several crises before its currency union achieved its current form.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The “Four Presidents’ Report”   presented to the Heads of State or Government in 2012 discusses the need to complete the Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.54,0)">This includes considering a fiscal union and even a political union, which are difficult topics and ones that I have not touched upon today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Let’s remind ourselves that Europe’s Heads of State or Government already “laid the foundation for completion of the European Union” with the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">This Treaty, according to former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, marked “a new, decisive step in the process of European integration that in a few years will lead to the creation of what the founding fathers of modern Europe dreamt of after the last war: a United States of Europe.”   It is time that this affirmation resulted in action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">A completed Union would not mean that Member States give up their national identities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Quite the contrary: they bring their national identities with them into the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">That is why we speak of “unity in diversity”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The Euro Exhibition illustrates this: while one side of our coins all share the same design, each Member has its own country-specific design for the reverse side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These designs often bear symbols of national identity, such as Milda, the symbol of freedom, who features on the Latvian euro coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But go and take a look for yourself!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">I hope you will enjoy the exhibition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">My thanks go to the Deutsche Bundesbank and the City of Osnabrück for inviting me to today’s opening event.</span><span
