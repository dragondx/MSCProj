    <span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)"> Maastricht and the future of Europe Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the presentation of a stamp commemorating the ten-year anniversary of the Maastricht Treaty Bundesfinanzministerium, 22 October 2003 Dr Eichel, Dr Genscher, Dr Waigel, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, It is a great honour for me to make one of my final public appearances as President of the European Central Bank on the occasion of the launch of a "Sonderpostwertzeichen" – a special stamp – to commemorate the Treaty on European Union, better known as the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">It is not as a Dutchman that I consider this Treaty to be one of the most important milestones of the European integration process, but as a truly convinced European.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Together with the Governing Council of the ECB, I have been responsible for managing the single monetary policy and the single currency of the euro area, and I will not deny that my job has been inextricably linked to the wider historical process of building an "ever closer union" of the peoples of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">In this respect, I consider that the Maastricht Treaty embodies the most decisive impulse in the deepening of the European Communities established in the 1950s and strengthened by the Treaty of Rome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The move to Economic and Monetary Union   was a profoundly political act – despite the fact that the underlying rationale was predominantly economic, namely that a single market requires a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Having been instrumental in laying the foundations for the euro, the principles of the Maastricht Treaty will remain vital for the successful functioning of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The medium-term macroeconomic policy framework laid down in the Maastricht Treaty has contributed to a stable macroeconomic environment, and will continue to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In addition, the Treaty provides for a clear allocation of responsibilities between EU institutions and Member States, as well as clear mandates for all involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The maintenance of price stability  , the independence of the Eurosystem and the provisions safeguarding fiscal discipline, in particular as enshrined in the Stability and Growth Pact, are among the hallmarks of this framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Furthermore, the path towards participation in the euro area mapped out in the Maastricht Treaty, focusing on sustainable economic convergence as a prerequisite for adoption of the euro, will also serve to guide prospective Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The name "Maastricht" will therefore always be connected with the euro and will forever have a prominent place in the history of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">When the Maastricht Treaty was ratified ten years ago, many doubted whether EMU would ever amount to more than the solemn words of a Treaty or a laudable objective to be reached at some point in the distant future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">However, during the 1990s, policy-makers, governments, central bankers and other political and economic agents showed great resolve and determination to ensure that the single currency would become a reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Today, we can look back on a period of more than five years in which the ECB has successfully pursued a stability-oriented single monetary policy serving more than 300 million citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">And we all have the tangible proof of Monetary Union in our pockets, following a highly successful cash changeover process, which represents another historic milestone in the process of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">With the euro, this network of interrelations and mutual dependencies in Europe has undoubtedly reached a new level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">When talking about the possible political implications of the euro, there are fundamental questions about the future of Europe to be answered, and I hope that my subsequent remarks will provide some interesting insights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Can Monetary Union function properly without some form of political union?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Is a "currency without a state" a viable construct?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.55,0)">Indeed, the question of whether a single currency requires – or inevitably leads to – a single state is hotly debated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.32,0)">I think that one of the reasons for this confused state of affairs is that "political union" is a rather abstract concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.72,0)">It can mean different things to different people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">On the one hand, political union can be broadly understood as a dense network of integrated policies, common rules and established procedures, as a union with strong and active supranational institutions, with common symbols and a common identity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The European Union already exhibits many of these features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">If, on the other hand, we understand political union as the establishment of an entity that resembles the traditional nation state, the European Union may still have some way to go, if indeed this is the direction that Europeans want to take.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.99,0)">Today's Union is not a European Federation, for example, or a United States of Europe, with a constitution and a single executive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The euro marks the achievement of full integration in the monetary field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In purely functional terms, it is therefore an end point, rather than an intermediate step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">However, with the euro, we now form a "Schicksalsgemeinschaft", a community with a shared future Our economies are linked, and so our policy decisions have become a matter of concern for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We have a legitimate interest in developments and political actions in other euro area countries, since we are affected by them – for better or for worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">If I may use a "domestic" metaphor, the marriage in which the euro has joined our countries is about more than just living under the same roof, it is about sharing a common vision and about managing life together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Concluding remarks In the context of the current attempts to help the European Union work smoothly and on a sustainable basis following its future enlargement, I would like to conclude by mentioning the draft Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">The process of European integration has delivered half a century of stability, peace and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">It has helped to raise living standards, built a single European market, launched the single European currency, the euro, and strengthened Europe's voice in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">As a central banker, I would argue that the draft Constitution has incorporated the substance of the EMU chapters of the Maastricht Treaty, while also introducing clarifications, additions and updates to the existing texts where necessary and appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Clearly it is now up to the governments of the Member States to move forward in the Intergovernmental Conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">My wish for the draft Constitution is that it will achieve the same success as the economic and monetary policy part of the Maastricht Treaty.</span>
