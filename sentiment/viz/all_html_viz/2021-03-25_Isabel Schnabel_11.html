    <span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)"> Paving the path to recovery by preserving favourable financing conditions Speech by Isabel Schnabel, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at NYU Stern Fireside Chat Frankfurt am Main, 25 March 2021 For more than a year now, central banks worldwide have been tackling the fallout from the coronavirus   crisis with unprecedented measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.26,0)">The pandemic has posed enormous challenges to monetary policy, which have varied over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.88,0)">The first phase of the crisis caused severe dislocations in global financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.54,0)">Liquidity dried up, asset prices plunged and markets became fragmented, causing a broad-based flight to the safest assets in what became known as a “dash for cash”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">By offering to purchase large amounts of securities, central banks succeeded in restoring orderly trading conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">In the euro area, we established the pandemic emergency purchase programme, the PEPP, under which we bought assets worth more than €200 billion over a period of just two months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.32,0)">In doing so, we prevented the public health crisis from turning into a full-blown financial crisis, a risk that was particularly acute in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.76,0)">Concerns about the impact of the pandemic on public finances caused a wide divergence in the borrowing conditions for euro area sovereigns, impairing the transmission of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The PEPP immediately instilled confidence in financial markets and succeeded in reducing fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">This was reinforced, in a strong act of European solidarity, by the agreement on the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">However, restoring financial market stability did not remove the risks to our primary mandate of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.2,0)">As the rise in infection numbers in Europe began to accelerate again after the summer and the risks of a second wave materialised, the economic and inflation outlook in the euro area deteriorated notably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Just when the outlook was at its darkest, news of the imminent arrival of multiple vaccines brought the long-awaited light at the end of the tunnel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The sources of uncertainty then shifted from whether the crisis can be contained to when we can expect a return to normality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.34,0)">The December staff macroeconomic projections suggested that this path could still be long and bumpy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.51,0)">Consumer price inflation was projected to reach no more than 1.4% in 2023, well short of our medium-term aim of below, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.59,0)">Beyond the near-term damage that the pandemic was inflicting on the economy, economic slack was expected to weigh on price pressures for a considerable period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Further decisive monetary policy support was needed to offset the effect of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation, in line with our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The question facing the ECB’s Governing Council at its meeting on 10 December 2020 was how to best provide this support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Our policy response needed to take two factors into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">One was that the unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy support had succeeded in delivering highly favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.32,0)">The nominal euro area GDP-weighted yield curve stood at its lowest ever recorded level  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.84,0)">Yields up to a maturity of ten years were in deep negative territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.01,0)">Real long-term expected risk-free interest rates stood at around -1.5%, close to the lowest level ever recorded in the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.98,0)">Bank lending rates, which are the rates that matter most for households and small and medium-sized enterprises, were also at historical lows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.59,0)">The other factor was that large uncertainty, risk aversion and wide-ranging mobility restrictions meant that a significant part of the economy was unlikely to be able, or willing, to take advantage of these financing conditions in the near term, delaying the effect of monetary accommodation on aggregate demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.85,0)">Surveys suggested that a large share of households did not plan to make major purchases over the next 12 months  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.74,0)">Their savings intentions remained at historically high levels as uncertainty continued to weigh on sentiment and consumption opportunities remained restricted amid renewed containment measures  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In other words, there was a substantial degree of monetary accommodation that, if preserved, could be expected to provide a measurable boost to aggregate demand and underlying price pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The Governing Council responded to these conditions with a powerful commitment to preserve favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">What distinguishes a policy of preserving favourable financing conditions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Two main characteristics distinguish this policy from the way asset purchases had been conducted before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.05,0)">The first is a departure from a policy that attempts to push interest rates even lower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The effectiveness of monetary policy is highly state-contingent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The benefits from reducing interest rates further from very low levels may still outweigh the costs in certain circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And since we are not yet at the effective lower bound, such actions remain possible in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.37,0)">But when uncertainty is large and private demand constrained, monetary policy is like “pushing on a string”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Pushing harder in such circumstances would likely have limited effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">In addition, a growing body of evidence suggests that the potential benefits of pushing rates lower may diminish even when uncertainty fades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">The central idea behind lowering interest rates is to provide incentives to bring forward consumption and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.25,0)">But when rates have been low for a long time, fewer and fewer firms and households are left to respond to an additional monetary policy impulse, in particular when investment and durable goods demand are both “lumpy” and infrequent, as a large body of evidence suggests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">One way of looking at this is to consider the share of new variable short-term loans for house purchases  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.1,0)">This share has fallen visibly in the euro area as many borrowers have already renegotiated their mortgages to lock in more favourable rates, potentially dampening the sensitivity of credit demand to lower rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.3,0)">These effects may be amplified if the pass-through of market and policy rates to bank lending and deposit rates weakens or slows in the vicinity of the effective lower bound  , or if a flatter yield curve reduces banks’ incentives to undertake maturity transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.97,0)">Lowering interest rates further from very low levels may not only result in diminishing returns, it may also come with increasing costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">A case in point is financial stability risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Years of monetary stimulus have made asset price valuations highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.04,0)">In the United States, for example, the yield that investors currently earn in excess of a real ten-year US government bond yield has fallen measurably  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.83,0)">In the euro area, signs of overvaluation are increasingly visible in real estate markets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.36,0)">Hence, the harder we push today, the larger the potential risks may be for price stability tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">In such circumstances, monetary policy can best support the economy by ensuring that favourable financing conditions prevail for as long as needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">The second characteristic is the way we deliver on our commitment to preserve favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Rather than absorbing assets at a constant pace, we purchase flexibly according to market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">We buy more when financing conditions are becoming less favourable, and we buy less when they are stable or improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This flexibility helps increase the efficiency of our purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In other words, our pledge to preserve favourable financing conditions shifts the focus from quantities – the amount of assets we purchase – towards prices – the conditions at which sovereigns, firms and households can access credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.91,0)">During the first phase of the crisis, quantities were an end in themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">They were necessary to restore market functioning and bring about appropriately accommodative financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Today, they are a means to an end: they are used to the extent necessary to deliver on our commitment to preserve favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Preserving favourable financing conditions: a reaction function How, then, can this policy be implemented in practice?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.83,0)">And what is the reaction function?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Markets will be able to better anticipate our actions if they understand which movements in market prices are likely to be considered favourable and which ones are not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">And the better investors internalise our policy, the larger the potential efficiency gains will be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me start by recalling two fundamental principles of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.73,0)">One is that real interest rates affect consumption and investment decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.5,0)">In themselves, nominal interest rates typically have little bearing on the behaviour of firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.46,0)">And since higher nominal rates can go hand-in-hand with higher growth and higher actual inflation in the future, they are not a good indicator of the degree of monetary policy accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The other principle is that the favourability of financing conditions is a relative concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Historically low real interest rates do not necessarily imply that the degree of stimulus is historical too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The latter crucially depends on how real interest rates compare to real equilibrium rates – that is, those rates that are consistent with a stable rate of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.53,0)">Monetary policy is only accommodative if actual real rates fall below these equilibrium rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Conversely, an increase in real interest rates is not necessarily a sign that financing conditions are becoming less favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">For example, as the economy recovers, real and nominal long-term rates will gradually rise in tandem with the real equilibrium rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Monetary policy will not tighten in this case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It will retain the same level of accommodation as the gap between the actual real rate and the equilibrium rate remains unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">These considerations are what distinguishes a policy of preserving favourable financing conditions from yield curve control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">The latter targets a fixed level of nominal yields with a view to increasing, rather than preserving, the degree of monetary accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.83,0)">This would not be consistent with the considerations I outlined above: it would mean that real rates were not sufficiently accommodative to begin with, and that lower real rates come at no cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To see this more clearly, it is useful to look at current estimates of the real interest rate gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.91,0)">Until a few years ago, policymakers mostly focused on the real short-term interest rate gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.43,0)">But this exclusive focus is no longer appropriate in a world where central banks increasingly try to influence long-term interest rates through forward guidance and asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The real long-term interest rate gap has become equally important over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Although there is considerable uncertainty regarding real equilibrium rates, let alone their term structure, ECB staff estimates suggest that the gap between the actual real ten-year rate and the estimated real ten-year equilibrium rate is likely to be highly significant, even when accounting for model uncertainty  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Monetary policy has thus managed to remain highly accommodative despite the steady decline in equilibrium rates over time  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">A policy that commits to preserving such a degree of accommodation provides measurable support to aggregate demand and hence underlying price pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.65,0)">There are, however, instances where rising rates would unduly tighten our policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.92,0)">For example, a rise in the real term premium – that is, the compensation that investors demand for risks related to the future path of real short-term interest rates – could signal growing uncertainty around the monetary policy outlook or indigestion of duration supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.66,0)">A rising real term premium was the main reason behind the sharp uptick in bond yields seen during the 2013 taper tantrum in the United States and in March last year  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">These types of movement, if sizeable and persistent, make financing conditions less favourable as they are not accompanied by a corresponding increase in real equilibrium rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.74,0)">This channel seems to have played less of a role in recent weeks   but we are conscious of the fact that it may well affect financing conditions in the current environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The reason for this is that protecting society from the appalling consequences of the pandemic will require continued strong fiscal support, and hence high net public debt issuance, resulting in an increase in duration risk to be absorbed by markets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.41,0)">This could put unwarranted upward pressure on the real term premium over the period of net asset purchases  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">A firm commitment to favourable financing conditions therefore requires a certain minimum purchase volume to offset this effect on real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.46,0)">Rising rates are also a concern if the market is driven by animal spirits – if investors start to price in a strong recovery, albeit one that is still subject to considerable uncertainty − or if rates increase as a result of global spillover effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.21,0)">Such price dynamics risk increasing volatility and uncertainty and could result in vital policy support being withdrawn prematurely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Preserving favourable financing conditions therefore puts the drivers of changes in financing conditions, and their speed of adjustment, into the focus of our assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In this assessment, cross-asset price correlations can help identify and interpret potential changes in real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">For example, if stock markets increase and credit spreads tighten in response to a rise in real interest rates, markets are likely to price in a stronger growth outlook that could leave financing conditions favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In addition, changes in market-based financing conditions have to be assessed jointly with the likely future trajectory of the economy, in particular the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The Governing Council meetings in which we discuss the quarterly ECB/Eurosystem staff projections have an important role here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But it is important to note that this does not limit our flexibility to adjust purchase volumes in the period between meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">If market conditions require, the pace and composition of purchases can be flexibly adjusted in both directions at any time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Assessing recent market developments Between the December decision and our most recent Governing Council monetary policy meeting on 11 March, we saw a rapid increase in global and euro area nominal interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">How should these changes in financing conditions be assessed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The factors that have caused a rise in risk-free interest rates have been largely benign in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">At the time of our meeting, nominal ten-year overnight index swap   rates were up by about 30 basis points, entirely reflecting a rise in the inflation component  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.56,0)">These movements should not be seen as reflecting a genuine reappraisal of the expected future path of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Term structure models suggest that much of the recent rise in nominal ten-year OIS rates reflects an increase in term premia which, in turn, likely reflects a rise in the inflation risk premium  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In other words, markets have started to revise the balance of risks around the medium-term inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">After a long period in which inflation persistently and repeatedly surprised to the downside, markets no longer exclude the risk that inflation may rise more strongly than previously expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There are a number of reasons why investors might think this way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.63,0)">One is that accumulated excess savings resulting from a lack of spending opportunities are large enough to meaningfully affect the trajectory of the economy in the medium term  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is difficult to predict what portion of these savings will end up being spent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.55,0)">It is also unclear how firms will adjust their profit margins to make up for lost income and higher leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Before the pandemic, profit margins were a key contributor to weak inflation by absorbing cost-push pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.8,0)">But the pass-through of higher input prices – for example for oil and copper – to final consumer prices may change in an environment of weaker balance sheets, supply bottlenecks and large pent-up demand  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Yet, rising nominal rates have not been accompanied by a rise in real rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Real ten-year yields fluctuated over the period but have returned to their December levels, thereby protecting the prevailing high degree of accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.48,0)">Real rates up to a maturity of five years have even continued to reach new historical lows in recent weeks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The stability of real interest rates is likely to have reflected a combination of two factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">First, the PEPP’s calendar-based forward guidance, promising net asset purchases until at least March 2022, has allayed fears of early tapering in the euro area, keeping the real term premium anchored at very low levels, supported by our continued net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.25,0)">Second, the near-term growth outlook for the euro area remains highly uncertain and clouded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.24,0)">Large parts of the euro area economy remain paralysed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Vaccination campaigns are progressing slowly, infection numbers are rising and containment measures are stricter than in other parts of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">This interpretation is consistent with the picture painted by the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections, which foresee an economic and inflation outlook that is largely unchanged from the December 2020 projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">While the risks surrounding the growth outlook over the medium term have become more balanced, downside risks remain in the near term, mainly owing to the rapid spread of virus mutations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.19,0)">In the light of these risks, the speed of adjustment of nominal yields was considered to pose a threat to the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.19,0)">There was a risk that markets were getting ahead of themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.6,0)">Movements in financial markets had become disorderly at times, increasing volatility and thus uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.91,0)">The risk of an overly abrupt and premature withdrawal of vital policy support was corroborated by model-based evidence that suggests that a significant part of the rise in ten-year OIS rates reflected global spillovers  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Against this backdrop, the Governing Council announced that we would significantly step up purchases under the PEPP in the second quarter, in line with market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Preserving favourable financing conditions is a powerful policy response to the challenges we are currently facing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">It is a strong commitment to protect an exceptional degree of policy accommodation for as long as needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">It signals our unwavering determination to offset the impact of the pandemic on the projected inflation path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">And it is a promise to the people of Europe that the ECB will do its part to mitigate the social and economic costs of this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">This promise is underpinned by a purchase envelope that is unprecedented in the history of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">We will continue to deploy this envelope resolutely and efficiently, guided by our commitment to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">If favourable financing conditions can be maintained with asset purchase flows that do not exhaust the envelope over the net purchase horizon of the PEPP, the envelope need not be used in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Equally, the envelope can be recalibrated if required to maintain favourable financing conditions to help counter the negative pandemic shock to the path of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">We will flexibly adjust our purchases over time and across asset classes and jurisdictions in a way that ensures favourable financing conditions for the entire economy and paves the path to recovery.</span>
