    <span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)"> Making SEPA a reality – Involving the public sector in the Single Euro Payments Area Keynote address by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB at the conference “SEPA: An opportunity for Europe – Role of the public sector” organised by the European Commission, Brussels, 8 May 2007 Ladies and gentlemen, First of all, let me thank Charlie McCreevy and the European Commission for organising this event, which brings together some of the key European decision-makers of the public and financial sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">I am pleased that more than 200 representatives of the public sector have had the opportunity to gather here today to discuss the implications of the introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Five years ago the public sector, together with the banks, the retail industry, the European Central Bank   and the national central banks  , introduced the euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The cash changeover was a “concerted action” – a real joint effort – that proved to be very successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Within weeks, citizens all over the euro area had switched to the new currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">From the “virtual” common currency of their bank accounts, the euro had become a tangible reality in their wallets and purses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">For me, SEPA is not only the natural progression towards completing Monetary Union, it is a project that also requires a concerted action, just as the euro cash changeover did.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.17,0)">SEPA is too important a project to leave it to the banks alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Modern payment systems benefit everyone: business wants them and the customers will appreciate them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">SEPA is part of a bigger project to integrate and modernise the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Thus, banks, central banks, the public sector and other stakeholders need to work together to make SEPA a reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Moreover, the SEPA project also offers great opportunities for the public sector to make administrations more efficient and service-oriented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me be clear about the purpose of my speech: I am here not to lecture you about what the public sector “ought to do”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">I want to speak about the great potential that SEPA entails for the public sector and the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In my view, SEPA is not about “compliance”; it’s about “opportunities”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">In the conference today, many good initiatives of the public sector will be presented and I am looking forward to learning more about your planning towards SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">I will first elaborate briefly on the benefits of financial integration, especially in the payments field, before I explain the impact of SEPA on the efficiency and quality of public services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Financial integration of retail payment markets The integration of financial markets in Europe is of crucial importance for the ECB because of its impact on the development and efficiency of the financial system and its potential for stronger economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Although substantial progress has been made in the integration of several market segments, the current fragmentation of retail payment infrastructures has so far prevented competition between service-providers of different regions in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.24,0)">Fragmentation has also hampered the development of innovative solutions, especially in the field of cross-border payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.85,0)">For example, if you came to this conference today by car, you may have noticed that it is still difficult to pay with a foreign debit card at petrol stations here in Belgium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.88,0)">Moreover, it is not possible to initiate direct debits between euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">The SEPA initiative will foster competition and innovation in the banking industry by removing the barriers that formerly protected national markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">SEPA will create a single set of rules, equal access conditions and equal treatment across the continent, so that banks will be able to offer efficient services in new markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">With SEPA, consumers, corporations and merchants will be able to compare their national products and services with those of a larger pool of providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">By doing so, SEPA will not only improve cross-border payments: SEPA will improve all payments, irrespective of their location.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">I expect that both banks and end-users will benefit from more efficient payment instruments and services, which are superior in terms to timeliness, cost and quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Indeed, I expect that SEPA will reduce the costs, increase the convenience and automation and ensure the transparency of payments in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">SEPA will also have a positive impact on the efficiency of the financial system and the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me now turn to the role of the public sector in SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The role of the public sector The public sector has a crucial role in actively fostering the competitiveness of the European economy and promoting the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">The objectives of the public sector, as agreed by the EU Council in the Lisbon Agenda, are clear, and financial integration is one of the tools to help us to achieve the Lisbon objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This is the political context in which finance ministers declared their support for SEPA last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In addition, there is also an operational context, where public administrations are major initiators and receivers of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.66,0)">The public sector faces a key question today: should it regard SEPA simply as a “compliance issue”, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">new standards that have to be implemented, or should it take SEPA as a real opportunity to actively support the move towards a more efficient economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I think there can be no doubt about the answer to this question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The public sector should play an active role in the integration and modernisation of the financial sector, together with the banking industry, suppliers and the other users of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Concerted action is therefore needed to bring forward innovation in the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The public sector as an innovator If we look at initiatives in the “e-governance” domain, we see that many public administrations are in the process of improving their administrative processes and their interaction with the citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Many public administrations have already started to make extensive use of new information and communication technologies that streamline the administration and increase the efficiency of the services offered to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Indeed, many public administrations are increasingly choosing to become innovators through their “e-governance” programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In Finland, for example, the e-government initiative has simplified the administration of the information from citizens and has made it easier for the administrations to monitor the processing of information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">A project has been set up to integrate the information systems of different administrations, enabling citizens to access their information related to social welfare and health care, irrespective of their location in the country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">You are probably familiar with the comparative ranking of public administrations which was made by the United Nations in its Global E-government Readiness Report  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">It showed that many EU Member States are among the top ten countries that provide “e-government” services to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">And several EU countries are also among the top ten countries ranked in the “e-participation”   index.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">This comparative ranking of “e-government” and “e-participation” shows that some administrations have become very advanced in terms of the services they offer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">One could also imagine an additional ranking that includes “e-payments”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Such a ranking could list those public administrations that implement the SEPA payment schemes and initiate their payments electronically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Indeed, praise should be given to those public administrations that innovate their processing and increase the efficiency of their public spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.54,0)">Challenges for the public sector Many public administrations, however, also face some challenges when implementing major projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.85,0)">These challenges relate to commitment, communication and coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Let me briefly explain these three challenges, which require concerted action from the public sector and the banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">An important challenge is related to the commitment made towards a project by the workforce of the organisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Major reforms have to be supported by all the members of the organisation at both the managerial and technical levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Concerning the “e-government” initiatives, for example, the public administrations agreed on the need to move towards an information society with improved services, and they have defined a strong business case to support it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Similarly, the changes related to SEPA should be built around a strong case for improving the administration’s services and its internal handling of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The public administrations, together with the banking industry and the central banks, could identify the possibilities of reducing manual interventions and by migrating to simplified handling of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The new SEPA schemes should be used to optimise the internal processing and could, for example, also include, at a later stage, e-invoicing and procurement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">There are already first initiatives in this direction taken by some Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Let mention, as one interesting example, Italy, where central bank has joined forces with the banking association and the public administration to increase the automation of payment processes in Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">A joint committee has been set up to coordinate the introduction of SEPA, which will contribute to the reform of the internal organisation of the administration related to payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The public sector will not only introduce the SEPA standards, but will also pay part of the salaries from Italian public administrations through a single channel with simplified procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.79,0)">Another challenge is related to communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.52,0)">Many public administrations are not familiar with the SEPA initiative and there is the lack of visibility of the available solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">In our conference organised last November   with the banking industry, I concluded that the dialogue with the public administrations should be strengthened, and that public administrations should be more closely involved in the national implementation committees of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">A communication strategy by the banking industry should be organised for specific audiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The public administrations could also contact the banking industry or the national SEPA implementation committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.27,0)">As a final remark, a particular challenge of public administrations is their decentralised nature, which complicates the coordination between local and independent administrations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In Finland, for example, the central administration has ensured horizontal coordination of the “e-governance” project by setting the overall vision and objectives for an information society under the responsibility of one member of cabinet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">It has also ensured vertical coordination with local or regional administrations through the dissemination and exchange of information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">For the implementation of SEPA, a strong and convincing overall vision has also to be prepared by the central administration, which should ensure horizontal and vertical coordination and implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">The overall vision should be discussed with local levels of administration, so that they are convinced of the changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">The NCBs stand ready to assist the public administrations where needed in developing an inclusive approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Conclusion Let me close my address with my two main messages for the public sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">First, from my experience at the Austrian central bank and the ECB, I am convinced that public administrations should remain competitive in an increasingly integrated market, and that they have to become a truly modern, streamlined service-provider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">SEPA is a tool for public administrations to improve their internal payment processes and provide efficient services to the citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">The ECB is strongly committed to the SEPA project, and we will start initiating SEPA-compliant retail payments in January 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Currently we use different channels to initiate our payments, depending on whether they are intended for Germany or abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We will further streamline our internal processing so that, from January 2008, we are able to use only one channel for all our retail payments in euro, irrespective of the country of destination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Second, as with the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins, the implementation of SEPA also needs to be a concerted action to overcome the challenges associated with such a major project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The banking industry, ECOFIN, the European Parliament, and the Eurosystem have all showed their support for the implementation of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In the remaining eight months before the launch, it is important that public administrations also actively drive in the implementation process together with the citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">I conclude that financial integration is crucial for Europe, as it continuously modernises the services offered and fosters competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">For some, financial integration is a slow process, but it is inevitable and it is an ongoing process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">SEPA contributes to the larger project of integrating and modernising the financial sector, and thus to the objectives of the Lisbon Agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">SEPA therefore deserves the commitment of us all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">At the same time, SEPA enables us to meet the expectations of the public, in being a cost-conscious, innovative and forward-looking administration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">So, not only for the sake of SEPA as a European project, but also for the sake of your own organisation and the citizens, it is important to make SEPA a reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The UN Global E-government Readiness Report 2005  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The “E-government
