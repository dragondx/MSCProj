    <h2> Introductory statement by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Brussels, 23 January 2002 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)"> Testimony before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliamentwith the President of the European Central Bank, in accordance with Article 113  of the Treaty on European Union Introductory statement by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Brussels, 23 January 2002 With the transcript of the questions and answers Before starting my presentation, allow me, Mrs. Randzio-Plath, to congratulate you on your re-election as chairwoman of this committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">I am looking forward indeed to continuing the co-operation with you and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in the same open and constructive spirit that has always marked our regular exchanges of views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Just over three weeks ago, we witnessed a historic moment: the euro, first introduced on 1 January 1999 and successfully used for non-cash operations both within the euro area and on international financial markets for the past three years, became tangible reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">On 1 January 2002, the euro banknotes and coins became legal tender in the euro area and are now a visible symbol of Europe's identity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Indeed, paying with a single currency in daily transactions throughout the euro area can be regarded as an achievement of historic proportions as well as a major step forward in the process of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Review of the euro cash changeover Today, some three weeks after the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins, I am pleased to report to you that the cash changeover has so far progressed very smoothly, better than we expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.29,0)">Some minor mishaps have occurred here and there, and some may yet occur, but this is quite normal for such a massive operation, involving - in the 12 euro area countries alone - more than 300 million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The completion of the changeover has been a complex, ambitious and unprecedented undertaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">In addition to the EU institutions, the Eurosystem and national authorities, it was essential to closely involve the banking sector and security carriers, as well as retailers and the cash-operated machine industry, in the preparations at an early stage, as a smooth changeover, in a short period of time, could only be achieved through a systematic and co-ordinated interaction on the part of all leading actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It required organisational, logistical, technical and economic efforts by all parties involved in the use and handling of banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">At the end of the day, however, the success of the euro cash changeover also depended on a favourable attitude of and swift acceptance by all citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">And, indeed, the European citizens have accepted their new currency rapidly and with enthusiasm, which can be considered as a clear signal in favour of a more integrated Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">I should like to take the opportunity here to express my gratitude to the European citizens and all parties involved in the changeover for their efforts and their fruitful collaboration with the Eurosystem over the years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Just to flag some of the efforts made: by the end of 2001, more than 6.5 billion euro banknotes worth some EUR 133 billion and amounting to almost 50% of national banknote circulation had been frontloaded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.66,0)">With regard to the euro coins, more than 37.5 billion coins with a total value of around EURï¿½12.4 billion had been frontloaded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Overall, citizens acquired more than 150 million coin starter kits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">At the beginning of this week, around 8.1 billion euro banknotes were in circulation, which is more than 90% of the number of euro banknotes that had initially been estimated for the end of February 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In terms of value, this corresponds to approximately EUR 209 billion, which is equivalent to 77% of national banknotes circulation at the end of 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.11,0)">In total, the legacy currency banknotes in circulation declined in 2001 by EUR 110 billion to EUR 270 billion at the end of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.58,0)">Since the beginning of 2002, this figure has come down by 51% to EUR 133 billion last Monday.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The euro progress ratio, which calculates the value of euro banknotes in circulation divided by the total value of euro and national banknotes in circulation, was 61% on 21 January 2002, up from 33% on 1 January 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Given that, in terms of transactions, around 70% of all banknotes are put into circulation via automated teller machines  , the quick adaptation of these machines was one of the key factors for a smooth changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.41,0)">In total, more than 200,000 ATMs had to be converted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In virtually all euro area countries, 100% of the ATMs were converted within less than one week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.37,0)">As a result, on average, 75% of all cash transactions were already effected in euro after only one week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.23,0)">Naturally, this figure varied from country to country and from sector to sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">On the whole, the euro banknotes and coins were introduced considerably faster than originally foreseen, not least because of the favourable attitude of and quick acceptance by European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Today, even though the technical adaptation of the vending machines has not yet been completed, the cash changeover can be considered to have been completed from the consumers' point of view, since practically all face-to-face cash transactions are being conducted in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.92,0)">More than 80% of the 10 million vending machines have been adapted, which indicates that this process is taking place at a slightly slower pace than the changeover in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.03,0)">This may cause some local problems whenever national coins are no longer in active circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.29,0)">With regard to counterfeiting, all euro counterfeits reported so far have been of very poor quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.96,0)">Thus far, no counterfeits have been found in central bank sorting operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Finally, I should like to inform you that the changeover has also been smooth and is progressing well outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The euro banknotes were received positively, especially in the accession countries, and euro banknotes are now available in banks and "bureaux de change" outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">With regard to the frontloading of central banks outside the euro area, I should mention that 26 central banks, mainly in central and eastern Europe, the Mediterranean area and in Africa, requested to be frontloaded with euro cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The total value of the euro banknotes provided to these central banks and to wholesale banks outside the euro area amounted to some EUR 4 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Economic and monetary developments Let me now turn to economic and monetary developments and our assessment of the outlook for price stability in the euro area in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Overall, there has been little change in our assessment since my last testimony to this Committee on 18 December 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Starting with the analysis under the first pillar of the ECB's monetary policy strategy, we have seen continued strong growth in M3 in the period up to November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The strong short-term dynamics of M3 over the autumn of 2001 seem mainly to be related to a particularly marked preference for liquid holdings by euro area investors in the context of the worldwide economic uncertainty following the terrorist attacks of 11 September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.2,0)">To the extent that these developments are of a temporary nature, monetary developments can be considered not to indicate future inflationary pressures at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">However, if not reversed, the recent building up of liquidity could call for a re-assessment of monetary developments in the coming months, especially at a time when the euro area economy recovers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.5,0)">Regarding the analysis under the second pillar of our strategy, recent information has confirmed our earlier assessment that economic activity in the euro area was weak in the second half of 2001 and will probably remain so in early 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">At the same time, there has been some evidence in late 2001 that supports the likelihood of a gradual economic recovery materialising in the course of 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Starting with external developments, there have been some incipient signs of stabilisation in the outlook for growth at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.56,0)">However, uncertainty remains high and some recently released data still provide mixed signals and do not yet point firmly to an imminent acceleration in economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.76,0)">In the euro area itself, recent survey data suggest that the decline in confidence may have bottomed out and that, notwithstanding the uncertainty about a turning point, economic activity may be firming.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Developments in financial markets could be seen as supporting this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">One of the main reasons for expecting a recovery in economic activity in the course of 2002 is the lack of fundamental economic imbalances in the euro area which would require a long correction process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Furthermore, financial conditions are favourable at present, and higher growth in real disposable incomes as a consequence of the expected decline in consumer price inflation should support domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Yet, while recent data have confirmed the expectation of a gradual recovery of the euro area economy this year, the timing and strength of this upturn remain uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Therefore, continued close monitoring of further incoming information is warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In the current economic environment, medium-term upward pressures on inflation are not likely to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.1,0)">Annual consumer price inflation, as measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices  , has declined steadily over the past few months and stood at close to 2% in December 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">This reflects the unwinding of past increases in energy prices and, albeit to a lesser extent, in food prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.95,0)">Recent information on producer prices supports the view that the decline in consumer price inflation will continue in the course of 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.87,0)">In the months to come, however, the path of HICP inflation might turn to be somewhat erratic on account of base effects related to developments in the HICP in early 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.79,0)">For this reason, the possibility of some short-lived upward movements in the annual rate of inflation cannot be ruled out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.26,0)">This should not, however, be a cause for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.29,0)">Likewise, downward shifts resulting from such base effects later in the spring should not signal a change in the longer-term outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">There has been much talk in the media and the public about whether the cash changeover will lead to higher prices in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.99,0)">Obviously, many prices have been rounded to new psychologically attractive prices in recent weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">But, according to all the evidence we have so far, rounding has been in both directions, up and down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.96,0)">However, some uncertainty still surrounds this assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Although a definitive picture will only materialise in the period ahead, there are good reasons to expect that the cash changeover will not have any significant effect on the general price level in the short term, as there is strong competition in the euro area retail sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">In addition, consumers and consumer associations have been very vigilant in pointing out attempts to increase prices in the phase of the cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Furthermore, the current economic environment limits the scope for price increases at the retail level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Moreover, the governments have committed themselves not to increase the average level of administered prices in the context of the cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Finally, we should also bear in mind that the cash changeover enhances price transparency across the euro area countries, thereby strengthening price competition in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.42,0)">This could, over the longer term, even lead to downward price movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.41,0)">Overall, on the basis of current information, annual inflation rates should fall safely below 2% this year and remain at levels consistent with price stability in the foreseeable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Against this background, the Governing Council concluded at its meeting on 3 January that the economic situation is developing in line with the forward-looking interest rate decisions taken last year and that it considers the current level of ECB interest rates to be appropriate for the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">I should like to stress, however, that the expectation of a favourable outlook for inflation in the medium term is dependent on the continuation of wage moderation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.46,0)">Excessive wage increases in the forthcoming wage negotiations would represent a source of concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">It is therefore of utmost importance to recall the key role played by wage moderation in fostering employment and maintaining a favourable outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Turning to fiscal policies, it is important that Member States maintain a medium-term perspective in compliance with the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">While the current weakness in economic growth presents a particular challenge for those countries which have not yet attained budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus or which have high public debt-to-GDP ratios, adherence to their medium-term objectives will strengthen consumer and investor confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Countries without fiscal imbalances can, of course, allow automatic stabilisers to operate in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That said, however, there is no case for fiscal activism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.85,0)">There is considerable evidence showing that fiscal policy can only contribute little, if anything, to stabilising economic activity, given the lags in the decision-making process and the time needed to fully affect economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.72,0)">Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that the possible short-term benefits resulting form the conduct of an activist fiscal policy may be outweighed by developments in long-term interest rates which might react adversely to the risks of a worsening in fiscal prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">At this stage, and in view of the still high level of structural unemployment in the euro area, it is important to recall that the key challenge for the euro area remains the improvement of the conditions for further expanding the production potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Substantial progress in the field of structural reforms is essential to strengthen the productive forces in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This requires an acceleration and deepening of structural reforms in the labour and product markets in order to provide economic agents with the proper incentives, as well as fostering technological innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Furthermore, governments should pursue determined reforms with regard to the size and structure of public expenditure and revenue, also in order to create room for further tax cuts and to absorb the fiscal costs of population ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">With the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, the process of monetary integration, which started ten years ago in Maastricht, has been successfully completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Now, the main task ahead of us is to continue with resolve the implementation of the structural reforms that are necessary to enhance the growth potential of the economy and economic welfare in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I stand now ready to answer your questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Transcript of the questions and answers Chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath   Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to welcome the President of the European Central Bank and congratulate him and his colleagues at the ECB, and throughout the European System of the Central Banks, on the very successful transition to euro notes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">I think there is a degree of optimism that has come with the introduction of euro cash, and with that, the investment climate in Europe seems to be getting better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.47,0)">Sometimes, psychological developments linked with such historical events are also good for things like growth and jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Today, we are also to talk about current monetary policy, and I give you the floor now straightaway, Mr President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Introductory statement by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, continues as published above Chairman, Mrs Randzio-Plath   Thank you very much Mr. Duisenberg for that introduction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I am sure that we will have a lot of questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Mr Radwan   President Duisenberg, I would also like to thank you and congratulate you on the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">I don't think anyone in Germany would have predicted half a year ago that the euro would have been so positively accepted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">At this point I would also like to thank the banks and the retailers, especially those banks that kept their counters open on January 1st, for contributing to a smooth change-over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">I believe the image of the ECB and that of its President have improved through this good switchover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">You talked about the inflation rate and one of the big discussions in Germany at the moment is the question of whether the introduction of the euro has led to an increase in the inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.24,0)">Some talk about 3%; some bank economists have given a much lower rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Perhaps you could be a bit more specific about this, and make it clear to the public that the euro has only had a very limited effect on inflation rates?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I think you have already made some comments on that and I would be particularly interested to hear how you evaluate current wage demands with regard to the future rate of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg Madam Chairman, I don't think I can add much to what I have already said in my introductory remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.63,0)">We have basically only anecdotal evidence on the impact of the cash changeover on the inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Many National Central Banks have made, and are making, special inquiries and the evidence we have gathered so far seems to indicate that if there is an impact, it is very small indeed because of the causes I mentioned in my introductory remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.79,0)">On interest rates, Madam Chairman, I really cannot add to what I said already in my introduction which is that the governing Council considers, in its assessment of the medium-term outlook, that inflation will come down to a level safely below 2% and stay there for a year, two years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">In that assessment it considers the current level of interest rates which prevails, with the minimum bid rate set by the European Central Bank at 3¼ %, as appropriate for the time being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Mrs Torres Marques   Thank you Madam Chairman.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Mr. President, I also would like to congratulate you on the successful introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">You had a decisive role in the whole process, as did our Chairwoman.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">All of us who were in this Committee in the last Parliament have now been able to see not just the creation of a new currency but its distribution in a tangible form so that all citizens now have a bit of Europe in their pocket - I think that has been a remarkable success and you played a decisive role in it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The notes and the coins have been very well accepted but I have now got some specific questions that we all ask ourselves every day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.54,0)">For example, on the coins, you will know that they are all the same on one side but all different on the other side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.4,0)">There have been countries lacking in imagination which put the same design on their side of all the coins and other countries with a lot of imagination which have a different design on each of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.32,0)">Now some people are a bit worried by this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">So do you think that this first set of coins is going to be above all of interest to numismatists and people who collect coins or are all the coins going to be the same in the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.26,0)">And my second question, about the notes which have been withdrawn from circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.29,0)">Are those notes really guaranteed to be destroyed and withdrawn from circulation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.02,0)">Mr Duisenberg As far as the coins are concerned, the European Central Bank is not responsible for them, the Ministers of Finance are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">I expect the 'national' sides to remain different, a decision has been taken in the various countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.76,0)">But then I would like to recall that the design of coins of the legacy currencies of the euro also, even if they were of the same denomination, used to be very different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.96,0)">Coins are also different in the United States, for example, whether you talk about a quarter or a dime or a penny, and that doesn't seem to pose any threat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">I do expect there is indeed some numismatic interest in coins, which makes the demand for coins higher than it is structurally likely to be, but I assure you that there will remain a demand for coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.01,0)">As for notes, all the notes that are offered for withdrawal to banks and subsequently to the central banks will be destroyed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Mr Schmidt   Mr. Duisenberg, I would like to congratulate you, Mr. Duisenberg, and the ECB on the switchover to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The Liberal group is represented here by two "outsiders" but still we're happy that everything went well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Mr. Radwan asked you a question and I would like to come back to that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.97,0)">Several reports which you yourself talked about showed that rounding up had happened and that it affects inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Now, I am not accusing you of withholding any information, the ECB is a very transparent organisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But perhaps you could be a little bit more specific.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In Germany we have had a discussion on this and this has happened in other countries as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.75,0)">Are there differences, do you see any differences today already among the 12 in the euro zone?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The UK, Sweden, and Denmark which are not part of the euro zone at this stage-are there some indications that we can count on them being part of the euro zone in the near future and having the same money as us?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.55,0)">Mr Duisenberg It is too early to say whether there are differences simply because we don't have the information yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.59,0)">As transparent as we are and we try to be, we simply don't have the information and it may take some time before we have it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Also, if you look at the inflation figures in individual countries, like for example the one that is to be published for Germany soon, that is the inflation figure for January, that will reflect increases in prices in certain sectors due to an increase in indirect taxation in Germany in the form of the ecotax which has been further increased as from 1st January, or as a result of the cold weather in January which has made food prices higher than usual for that month, even seasonally adjusted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.57,0)">But in countries which base their national inflation figures on the measurement done around the middle of the month, there will be no indication in that figure yet of the impact of the cash change-over on the inflation figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.75,0)">So, we simply don't have the information and we and you may have to wait for one or two more months before we have a clear picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.08,0)">Mr Schmidt   - Short follow-up question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.79,0)">Mr. Duisenberg, where do the reporters then get their information about the impact on the inflation rate of rounding up the price levels and so on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.94,0)">There is some information anyway and why can't you get it and analyse it, if the reporters can do it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Mr Duisenberg I get the information myself.</span><span
