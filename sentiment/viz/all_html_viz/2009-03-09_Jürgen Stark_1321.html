    <span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)"> Economic prospects and the role of monetary policy in the current situation Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB5.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.98,0)">Deutsch-Luxemburgische WirtschaftskonferenzLuxembourg, 9 March 2009 Ladies and Gentlemen, Since the second half of 2008, we have witnessed the deepest economic downturn since World War II and the fastest deceleration in inflation since the launch of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.09,0)">We have confronted this situation with unprecedented decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Unprecedented has been the magnitude and size of interest rate cuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.78,0)">Since October 2008, we have reduced key ECB interest rates by 275 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Unprecedented has been the scope of liquidity support we offer to the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.51,0)">But central banks alone are not in a position to resolve the current financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.11,0)">Policy makers need to prevent a further deterioration in economic and financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">To this end, resolute action is needed to restructure, recapitalise and consolidate the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.14,0)">To be realistic, the year 2009 will be a very difficult year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">2009 will be the year of adjustments in the balance sheets of banks, firms and private households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">These adjustments should lay the foundations for economic conditions to eventually stabilise and improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.44,0)">Let me now elaborate in greater detail on where we stand in terms of economic and monetary developments in the euro area and how this has affected the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">I will subsequently talk about how we have adjusted our refinancing operations in response to the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Finally, I will briefly discuss challenges in the resolution of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Economic prospects a.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Global economic situation Let me start with the economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.96,0)">The world economy is currently undergoing its deepest downturn since the second World War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.05,0)">The crisis started in summer 2007, as losses in the US sub-prime mortgage market, a relatively small segment of the US housing markets, triggered the ongoing financial turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However, its impact on the global economy remained relatively limited until the summer of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.42,0)">However, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers last September, the tensions in global financial markets escalated to a full-blown financial crisis and thereafter turned into a global economic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The severe global economic downturn has now become more synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.03,0)">The collapse in global trade has amplified the adverse impact from the financial turmoil and caused emerging market prospects to deteriorate drastically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.76,0)">In advanced economies, falling house prices, tumbling financial markets, collapsed household and business confidence, and the resulting need to restructure consumers’ and firms’ balance sheets have been curbing private consumption and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.25,0)">In emerging economies, nosediving global trade and the unwinding of both internal and external imbalances accrued in past years have led to a sharp decline or even negative GDP growth rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.01,0)">According to most economic forecasts, the weak growth period is expected to last for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.43,0)">For example, the IMF   projects that the world GDP growth would decelerate to only ½ % in 2009 measured in terms of purchasing power parity and even to turn negative when measured in terms of market exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.04,0)">For advanced countries this means a negative annual growth rate of -2% in 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">For emerging economies the growth is projected to remain positive, although the 3.3% growth projection is just half of the pace recorded in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.56,0)">While it is expected that the world economy will recover in 2010, risks surrounding the outlook are on the downside as the depth and length of the global economic downturn will crucially depend on the evolution of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.97,0)">The inflation outlook has also changed significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Global inflationary pressures are quickly diminishing In the short term, this is mainly due to effects from lower commodity prices, but over time, weaker labour market conditions and sluggish global demand increasingly play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">b. Euro area activity Let me now come to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Economic activity has not been sheltered from the negative impact of the global financial crisis We had seen already a moderation in the underlying momentum of euro area economic growth before the crisis got worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.49,0)">This slowdown reflected the dampening effects from sharp increases in commodity prices before the summer 2008 and the ongoing correction in the housing market in some euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.82,0)">As a result of all these factors, euro area activity declined markedly in the second half of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.43,0)">After falling moderately in the second and third quarters of 2008, euro area GDP growth contracted very sharply in the fourth quarter of the year, decreasing 1.5% quarter on quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.1,0)">This reflected not only a decrease in foreign demand for euro area exports but domestic demand was also adversely affected by domestic factors, notably very low confidence and tight financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.83,0)">Annual growth in 2008, at 0.8%, was the weakest rate since the early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.01,0)">Indicators for the first months of this year suggest a further large contraction in activity in early 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.46,0)">Consumer and business sentiment worsened further, falling to new all-time lows in February.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.9,0)">Moreover, labour markets have deteriorated which does not bode well for consumer spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.59,0)">In this context, let me stress that we in the ECB Governing Council anticipated in our interest rate decisions that there will be bad news to come for the first quarter of 2009, as we take our decisions in a forward looking manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.88,0)">Once these expectations of further weakness in growth are confirmed by official data, we will not to take it into account again – there is no double counting!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.28,0)">Looking ahead, we expect a protracted period of further weakness in euro area activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.32,0)">We have to face the truth that 2009 will be a very difficult year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It will be a year of balance sheet adjustments across banks, non-financial companies and private households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.94,0)">This could be a further drag on investment and consumer spending, already negatively affected by very low global demand, tight financing conditions and, in the case of private consumption, a further deterioration in labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">However, these corrections are inevitable as they lay the foundation of the gradual recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This is also reflected in the March 2009 ECB staff macroeconomic projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.98,0)">The expected negative or very low annual GDP growth in 2009 and 2010 somehow masks these developments as it is affected by negative carry-over effects of the previous year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Looking beyond the annual growth numbers, the underlying quarterly profile embodies expectations of increasingly positive quarterly rates of growth in real GDP over the course of 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Underlying this outlook is the expectation of a gradual improvement of the external environment and a normalisation in financial markets, reflecting the extensive policy measures that have been introduced to restore the functioning of the financial system, both inside and outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This together with low inflation rates which strengthen real incomes and the strong fiscal and monetary stimulus should support the gradual recovery in euro area activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.07,0)">In our view, the economic outlook remains surrounded by uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">The risks to economic growth appear now to be more balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">On the one hand, there may be stronger than anticipated positive effects, also on confidence, stemming from the extensive macroeconomic stimulus under way and reflecting other policy measures taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.17,0)">On the other hand, concerns relate mainly to the potential for the turmoil in financial markets to have a stronger impact on the real economy, as well as to the emergence and intensification of protectionist pressures and to possible adverse developments in the world economy stemming from a disorderly correction of global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.88,0)">c. Euro area price developments Let me turn to price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.17,0)">Inflation in the euro area has declined rapidly since it reached its highest level in over a decade in the summer of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.15,0)">According to Eurostat’s flash estimate, euro area annual HICP inflation was 1.2% in February 2009, well below the rate of 4.0% registered in July 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.26,0)">This decline primarily reflects the marked fall in global commodity prices, and in particular oil prices, over this period, owing mainly to weak global demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.87,0)">The fall in commodity prices has also contributed to a significant diminishing of supply chain pressures from very high levels as signalled by strong falls in survey measures on price setting indicators of companies and substantial declines in producer prices at early production stages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.49,0)">Looking ahead, HICP inflation is expected to fall further in the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.02,0)">This mainly reflects a rather technical effect which is called “base effect”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.82,0)">Base effects are important when looking at developments in annual inflation rates, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">comparing the price level now with the one registered a year ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.71,0)">The increases in energy and food prices, which led to the extended inflation hump until mid-last year, will subsequently drop out of the year-on-year comparison in the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.53,0)">These base effects will exert significant downward pressure on overall inflation and there is a high likelihood that in this process of ongoing disinflation annual HICP inflation in the euro area will temporarily turn negative in the middle of 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.25,0)">It also cannot be excluded that we will see in some euro area countries negative inflation rates for a more extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.36,0)">However, this will mark most probably only a trough in inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.46,0)">The same factors pushing down inflation in the first half of 2009, namely base effects related to volatile oil and food prices, will subsequently unwind and actually put upward pressure on prices, contributing to rising inflation rates over the course of the second half of 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.38,0)">Overall, the ongoing disinflation process in the euro area is expected to imply sharp fluctuations in HICP inflation rates during 2009 as also foreseen by the ECB staff projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">For 2010, the ECB staff project HICP inflation at moderate rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.35,0)">Let me emphasise that sharp fluctuations in annual inflation rates or the temporary emergence of negative inflation rates is a normal concomitant of any disinflation process, which by its very nature is temporary and thus should not be confused with another “d”-word, namely deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.44,0)">From a conceptual point of view, deflation is a completely different state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.15,0)">A deflationary process is a persistent, broad-based and self-sustaining decline in the overall price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.03,0)">It is reinforced by the anticipation that prices will decline further in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.88,0)">As a consequence, inflation expectations become unanchored and negative, with adverse effects on investment and consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">By contrast, disinflation, which is linked to transitory movements in relative prices, is per se a welcome development because it helps sustain real incomes, provided that medium-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at levels consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.81,0)">To the extent that this is the case, short-term volatility in annual inflation rates, including negative inflation rates, is not relevant from the medium-term perspective of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">We expect that price stability is maintained at the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Moreover, available information indicates that medium-term inflation expectations in the euro area are solidly anchored at levels consistent with the aim of the Governing Council of keeping inflation at rate of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Such a firm anchoring represents the strongest and most reassuring safeguard against any risk of a downward spiral of inflation and inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">The fact that we have a clear mandate and a clear definition of price stability is helpful in anchoring inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.85,0)">As in the case of growth, a considerable degree of uncertainty surrounds the inflation projections of the ECB staff.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Risks to these projections are broadly balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.03,0)">They relate in particular to the risks to the outlook for economic activity as well as to risks to commodity prices d. Monetary and financing conditions Latest money and credit data support the view that inflationary pressures have been diminishing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.62,0)">Broad money growth decelerated in 2008, increasingly so at the turn of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">In particular, it brought headline M3 growth back to levels that reflect the underlying monetary dynamics, which also decelerated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.44,0)">The financial turmoil and its intensification in September 2008 had a substantial impact on the behaviour of market participants and affected money and credit dynamics, leading to higher volatility in money and credit aggregates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">On the money side, this relates in particular to marketable instruments, but also to the significant substitution that is taking place between different categories of deposits included in M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.07,0)">On the credit side, the flow of bank loans to the private sector around the turn of the year was also rather volatile, partly reflecting a possible turn-of-the year effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.72,0)">But discounting this effect, latest credit developments confirms the decline in the growth of bank credit to households and firms observed during 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This shows how important it is to look through short-term developments when assessing the underlying pace of monetary expansion and the associated indication for risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.43,0)">Let me turn to the financing conditions in the euro area which have deteriorated further since September 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.72,0)">With plummeting equity valuations and soaring credit spreads, the overall cost of financing for euro area non-financial corporations has edged upwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.34,0)">At the same time, bank lending rates have declined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">In fact, it seems that the substantial past reduction in the key ECB interest rates is increasingly being passed through to bank lending rates, indicating that, despite the tensions in financial markets, the transmission mechanism of monetary policy is not significantly impaired in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Monetary policy Let me now turn to the second part of my speech, namely the role of monetary policy in the current situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.64,0)">The financial crisis has contributed to a pace in disinflation and economic deceleration which has been unprecedented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">This has required us taking unprecedented decisions to contain adverse spillover effects of financial market tensions on the real economy and thereby to maintain inflation over the medium term in line with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.6,0)">In a coordinated move, the ECB and other major central banks announced reductions in their policy interest rates on 8 October 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.36,0)">Overall, since October 2008, we lowered the key ECB interest rates by 275 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.42,0)">The overnight money market rates fell even more steeply over this period, as the ECB significantly enlarged its liquidity provision to euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Since October last year we have provided the banking sector with unlimited funds at maturities up to six months, against an expanded range of eligible collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">These decisions have been taken in a timely and decisive manner, in a context characterised by an exceptionally high level of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">To better understand the scale of our interventions in the interbank money market, one needs to appreciate its importance in the implementation and transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Money market interest rates, especially of short maturities mark the starting point in the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">They determine the marginal costs of refinancing of the banking sector and thereby act through the bank lending channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Money market interest rates are a key factor in determining the entire yield curve and thereby are crucial for the expectations channel of monetary transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.53,0)">Of course, longer-term interest rates and bank lending rates cannot be directly controlled by the central bank, but expectations of short-term money market rates are key in determining them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Contributing to the functioning of the money market and preventing a liquidity crunch therefore has been crucial to forestall a breakdown of the transmission of monetary policy and a systemic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">As a consequence of our measures, the Eurosystem’s consolidated balance sheet has grown by two thirds from summer 2007 until most recently, or by 6% of euro area nominal GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">To put these numbers into perspective, the size of our balance sheet has grown from 13% of euro area nominal GDP in 2007 to over 20% most recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">By providing unlimited funds in our refinancing operations we have ensured that banks facing difficulties raising funds in the market are always able to fulfil their liquidity needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">But we need to be realistic about what we, as a central bank, can achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In my view, we cannot expect to see the money market functioning the way it did before August 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.17,0)">What is certainly encouraging is that recently the volumes allotted in our refinancing operations have come down slightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The same is true for the number of banks participating in these operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.81,0)">Spreads between secured and unsecured interest rates at term maturity have gone down somewhat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">But they have remained high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.78,0)">The turnover in unsecured interbank lending, especially at longer maturities, still remains low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.1,0)">To be clear: The problem is not a lack of liquidity in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.69,0)">It is the lack of trust among the banks themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Unless trust in the solvency of banks is re-established, there is hardly any chance that conditions in the money market will normalise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">As already mentioned, financing conditions have not eased exactly in line with key ECB interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.83,0)">So will key ECB interest rates have to be cut to even lower levels?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">In principle, even after last Thursday’s decision the ECB could still contribute to easing credit conditions by cutting its key interest rates further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.87,0)">But this will not fundamentally solve the problems that have caused the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.77,0)">The contrary could be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.63,0)">If maintained for an extended period of time, too low or very low interest rates might in fact aggravate them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.38,0)">They have the potential to weaken the incentives for banks to clean up their balance sheet of troubled assets and monitor their credit risk carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.23,0)">This in turn may reinforce the very problems that currently impair the functioning of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.28,0)">Too low interest rates tend to foster lending to unprofitable business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.68,0)">This would harm the growth potential of the economy and thereby prepare the ground for anaemic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Or, as in the past, it could lay the foundations for another asset price bubble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.63,0)">Finally, very low interest rates hamper the functioning of the money market: The lower interest rates in the money market, the lower the incentive of banks to trade funds in the market rather than depositing them safely, at the same low return, with the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.75,0)">So, as we have started to operate at very low interest rates, are we running out of ammunition to ease monetary conditions further if warranted?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.84,0)">Do we need to take more non-standard measures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me emphasise that what we have implemented so far has already been rather unconventional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">But in considering any additional action to improve the functioning of the financial system and transmission of monetary policy we need to be mindful of our responsibilities and our mandate – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.5,0)">to be conscious of what monetary policy can do and, even more importantly, what it cannot, and consequently should not do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Central bank measures aimed at easing credit conditions have not been met with undivided enthusiasm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.05,0)">Commentators have worried about a host of issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.83,0)">Will the expansion of central bank balance sheets ultimately lead to inflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.86,0)">As central banks are seen as switching attention from implementing monetary policy by steering short-term interest rates to targeting the composition and size of their balance sheets, have they lost their instrument?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.6,0)">Have they become intransparent and unpredictable?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">With the measures put in place, how are central banks going to preserve their financial and political independence which has been so hard to earn?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.01,0)">Under what conditions and when are central banks going to unwind these measures?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I can assure you, we have not lost sight of the principles that have successfully guided us in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The measures that we have taken and any additional measures we might implement remain strictly consistent with our responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Accordingly they meet a whole range of criteria and they will continue to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Any additional measures need to be consistent with our mandate and our principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Consequently, they can only be taken with the view to pursue price stability and to contribute to the preservation of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Pursuant to this objective and the Treaty requirements the measures must be compliant with the prohibition of monetary financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.29,0)">In addition, the scope of such measures is limited by the need to contain the Eurosystems risk exposure so as to safeguard its financial independence, as otherwise the ECB will end up jeopardising its credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Furthermore, as conditions in the financial system will eventually improve and in line with our assessment of risks to price stability these measures will be unwound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.76,0)">Accordingly, and finally, bearing also in mind that the health of the financial system cannot be made the ECB’s responsibility, one needs to be careful not to blur the responsibility of monetary and fiscal authorities in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Of course, we will do whatever we judge to be necessary and appropriate to maintain price stability and contribute to the preservation of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But we will strictly adhere to these principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.2,0)">In considering further easing measures, these principles have obvious implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Central banks can alleviate liquidity risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.45,0)">But they cannot address the perceived solvency problems that impair the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">One could conceive measures to ease credit conditions by taking over some of the credit risk on commercial paper that banks currently hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The ECB has already been accepting corporate loans as part of collateral in its regular liquidity operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">By operating through the banking sector, this has significantly contributed to providing funding to non-financial corporations – and thereby an easing of credit conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Buying corporate debt outright would circumvent the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">We have a responsibility to keep the Eurosystem financially sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.48,0)">This concern puts a break on how much further we can expand our balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">How to solve the crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Clearly, the challenges for resolving the current crisis remain tremendous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.27,0)">There is no panacea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We have made our contribution by making sure that longer-term inflation expectations have remained anchored in line with price stability and by preventing a liquidity crunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It remains our responsibility to continue to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But one cannot rely solely on central bank policies to address all the consequences of the financial crisis and its fall-out on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Resolute action is needed to restructure, consolidate and recapitalise the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Specifically, action is needed to help banks support their balance sheet so as to sustain an adequate flow of credit to the non-financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Since last autumn, governments have provided or pledged a substantial amount in guarantees for new debt issuance by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In addition, they have recapitalised a number of financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The commitments to provide support are already substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">But it will take time for the measures to be completely implemented and to show their full effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">In case these measures prove to be insufficient, they need to be complemented by further actions to address problems on the asset side of banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">To be successful in resolving the financial crisis the asset support schemes need to meet a whole range of objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">From the central bank perspective the overwhelming objective is to safeguard financial stability and restore the flow of credit from banks to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">In addition, the measures taken will need to be implemented in a way so as to maintain a level playing field in the EU financial market and minimising the burden to public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In line with these objectives, the Eurosystem has issued a set of guiding principles for the design and implementation of asset support schemes to address the most critical issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Apart from guidance on the types of assets and institutions that would be eligible to support, these guiding principles call for an adequate degree of risk sharing as a necessary element to limit the cost to the government, to provide the right incentives to the participating institutions and to maintain a level playing field across these institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">They also mention that schemes with well-defined exit strategies should be favoured and that conditionality may be attached to such schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.38,0)">We face unprecedented challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">At the ECB we have demonstrated a willingness and capacity to react rapidly to exceptional circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.54,0)">We have cut interest rates sharply to forestall the emergence of downside risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">We have provided unlimited liquidity support to the banking system so as ensure that liquidity risk does not lead to a systemic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.68,0)">But, ultimately, we alone as central bankers cannot resolve the current financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The onus is now on governments, supervisory and regulatory authorities, and the financial industry itself, to cooperate to act resolutely to restructure, recapitalise and consolidate the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Such government measures are under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">On our side we will continue to do whatever we judge to be necessary and appropriate to maintain price stability and contribute to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">And in doing so we will stick to the principles that have served us well in the pursuit of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">We will safeguard our financial independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We will be transparent and accountable for our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Most importantly, we will remain faithful to our mandate and provide an anchor of confidence and stability in difficult times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.68,0)">IMF WEO Update, 28 January 2009.</span>
