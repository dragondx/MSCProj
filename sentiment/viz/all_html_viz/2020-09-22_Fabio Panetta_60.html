    <h3> Speaker: Fabio Panetta </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)"> Asymmetric risks, asymmetric reaction: monetary policy in the pandemic Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the meeting of the ECB Money Market Contact Group Frankfurt am Main, 22 September 2020 It is a pleasure to speak to the Money Market Contact Group today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Money markets and central banks have an important relationship which, when it is working well, makes monetary policy more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Money market prices reflect expectations of our policy and the understanding of our reaction function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">They are the first stage in the transmission of our policies to financing conditions for the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">So I am pleased to talk to you today about how I see current issues related to monetary policy – and to hear your views in return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The ECB’s policy response to the coronavirus   crisis In pursuing our price stability mandate, our policy response to the crisis had three goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The first was to counter the downward impact of the pandemic on the projected path of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The second was to ensure that all parts of the euro area had access to liquidity, which was crucial for weathering the lockdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">And finally, we sought to avoid damaging feedback loops between financial markets and the real economy, ensuring that other policies could play their full role in addressing the effects of the pandemic, in turn making our own policy more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">As a result of our policy measures, tail risks have been removed and systemic stress in the euro area has receded  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.99,0)">We have averted a liquidity and credit crunch, which would have amplified the collapse in activity and caused lasting damage to production capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.43,0)">Without the ECB’s action, the economic consequences of the pandemic would have been dramatic; we estimate that more than one million additional jobs would have been lost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">This has safeguarded the transmission of monetary policy, with money market rates reconnecting to the ECB policy rates and sovereign yields reconnecting to risk-free rates, as proxied by overnight index swap   rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Euro area real rates have now returned close to their pre-pandemic levels  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.92,0)">Latest observation: 18 September 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.03,0)">To give an idea of how our measures have helped, we estimate that the pandemic emergency purchase programme   and the additional envelope under the asset purchase programme have reduced the term premium in the average ten-year euro area sovereign yield by between 45 and 80 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.31,0)">The impact on lending conditions has been significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Our monetary policy measures, complemented by appropriate countercyclical supervisory measures, are enabling banks to keep credit flowing to households and businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">We estimate that the funding cost relief and capital relief associated with these measures – the combination of which amplifies their individual effects – will increase loans to non-financial corporations by more than 5 percentage points over the period 2020-22; in particular, we expect our targeted longer-term refinancing operations to add 3 percentage points to loan dynamics cumulatively by 2022 .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In July, the annual growth rate of loans to firms stood at 7%, more than double its level in February.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.86,0)">Bank lending rates, meanwhile, have remained close to historical lows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Benefiting from these developments, industrial production and the Purchasing Managers’ Indices   have rapidly improved, partly recuperating the previous losses  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In this crisis, our independent monetary policy and fiscal policies in the euro area have also mutually reinforced each other, thereby increasing confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">By restoring the proper functioning of financial markets, we have removed a major obstacle to expansionary fiscal policies: the euro area aggregate budget deficit is expected to widen to 8.8% of GDP in 2020, while the GDP-weighted sovereign yield curve lies in negative territory up to the ten-year maturity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.61,0)">This is the opposite of what we saw during the sovereign debt crisis, when yields increased alongside deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Fiscal support to the economy also made our own policy more powerful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is obvious in the case of loan guarantees, which ensure that banks do not ration credit to their borrowers in spite of increased uncertainty and credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">But active fiscal policy also complements monetary policy through other channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.61,0)">For example, survey data show that households with more confidence in fiscal support display lower precautionary behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.66,0)">Job protection schemes are a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">So, insofar as monetary policy empowers fiscal policy and increases confidence, it also empowers its own effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">The current economic situation Today, our monetary policy can gradually focus less on preventing financial and productive collapse and more on securing the return of inflation to our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">This was the explicit goal of our decision to expand and extend the PEPP in June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">And our pandemic support measures are contributing to that goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The measures we have introduced since March will materially support the inflation and growth outlook: according to conservative estimates by ECB staff, they are projected to increase inflation by around 0.8 percentage points cumulatively between 2020 and 2022, and GDP growth by around 1.3 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.65,0)">These are remarkable results, but the outlook we face is nonetheless not satisfactory yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.1,0)">According to the latest ECB staff projections, inflation is expected to remain subdued and to rise to just 1.3% in 2022, still uncomfortably below our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Inflation excluding the volatile components of food and energy, which plays an important role in our assessment, rises to only 1.1% in 2022.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.68,0)">Longer-term market-based inflation expectations remain very subdued and survey-based measures are at historic lows  ; real interest rates are higher than would be desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.37,0)">Turning to economic activity, the recovery remains partial and uneven; GDP is only expected to recover to pre-crisis levels by the end of 2022.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.3,0)">This outlook is clouded by an unprecedented degree of uncertainty, not least because it depends on uncertain public health developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.95,0)">The path to recovery is also exposed to new adverse shocks – such as a possible disorderly Brexit – as well as a loss of momentum due to various emerging economic and financial headwinds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The appreciation of the euro is one factor that we need to watch closely with regard to its implications for the medium-term inflation outlook, particularly at a time when current and expected inflation rates are both very low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The sustained appreciation in the external value of the euro has brought about an undesirable tightening of financial conditions and has offset some of the monetary accommodation provided by our measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.21,0)">The services sector, in which momentum has recently slowed somewhat, is another source of concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.3,0)">PMIs for the services sector worsened in August, likely reflecting its high sensitivity to the rise in COVID-19 infections and renewed social distancing measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.69,0)">Expenditure on several consumer services remains exceptionally low, and might be affected further by the deterioration of the public health situation in a number of euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.79,0)">Overall, private consumption in the second quarter of this year was 16.3% below its level at the end of 2019; consumer confidence remains well below its long-term average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.62,0)">Concerns also emerge from the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.38,0)">Close to five million people lost their jobs in the first half of this year, reversing half of the employment gains since 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.51,0)">Looking ahead, job and wage uncertainty is likely to remain elevated and give rise to continued precautionary behaviour among households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.17,0)">Moreover, credit risk perceived by banks may adversely affect loan supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.2,0)">Together with corporate balance sheet vulnerabilities, weak aggregate demand and ample spare capacity, this is likely to compress investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.59,0)">Against this background, new wage negotiations may lead to weaker outcomes, further entrenching weak inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">For as long as the number of COVID-19 cases continues to rise across Europe and new restrictions are introduced, it is hard to envisage a strong rebound in consumer sentiment and consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">And for as long as demand remains uncertain, it is hard to see how business confidence can strengthen and investment can fully recover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.91,0)">This is not a normal recession, and we will not see a normal recovery without appropriate policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Future policy calibration In these difficult circumstances, our policy must remain forward-looking, and there are two key elements to this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">First, we need to constantly reassess whether the policy support we are providing and the calibration of our instruments are adequate to address the evolving shocks I have described and to achieve our objective of bringing inflation back to our medium-term aim in a sustained manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">If we encounter shocks that compress demand and pose additional threats to price stability, our reaction function is clearly spelled out: a policy response is necessary and forthcoming.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The second element of a forward-looking policy response relates to how we assess and react to the balance of risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.09,0)">In this respect, the Governing Council’s view is that the risks to growth are currently on the downside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.61,0)">This expression worries me more today – given the sheer size of the downside risks we face – than it would in less extreme times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Moreover, given the disinflationary nature of the COVID-19 shock,  the low inflation expectations and the current levels of spare capacity, I consider a surge of inflation in the medium term above our aim just a remote possibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As an example, even in a very benign scenario such as the “mild” scenario in the latest ECB staff projections – which assumes a rapid evaporation of the pandemic – inflation would reach 1.8% in 2022.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.84,0)">Faced with such a sizeable downward skew, there is a strong case for our reaction function to be asymmetric, as the risks of a policy overreaction are much smaller than the risks of policy being too slow or too shy to react and the worst-case scenarios materialising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Against this background, macroeconomic policies – above all monetary and fiscal policies – must remain complementary and the support they provide may be needed for a long time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The credit market provides a clear example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.97,0)">Our bank lending survey suggests that banks would tighten credit standards considerably if public loan guarantee schemes are not maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.07,0)">Since there is evidence that these schemes have significantly suppressed the rate of corporate insolvencies, ending them prematurely at a time when even viable companies may face insurmountable financial barriers could lead to a sharp rise in corporate defaults and the associated adverse effects on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.3,0)">Similar problems would result, mutatis mutandis, from a premature tightening of financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">For as long as the growth and inflation outlook are at risk, monetary policy support will have to remain substantial, and if those risks to the outlook rise, our policy impulse will have to rise in tandem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">EU borrowing in response to the common shock will also be key to avoiding any fiscal cliff effects, through its support to both furlough schemes   and the recovery  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Structural policies also have a fundamental role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Given that the job-rich sectors of the economy are the hardest hit by this crisis  , the restructuring of our economies is vital: both to generate higher overall growth rates and to produce more and better jobs in other sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">For these countries, the sizeable funding provided at the European level presents a unique opportunity to address concerns of competitiveness and long-term sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Growth will be the only solution to the accumulation of public and private debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Our monetary policy response to the pandemic has removed adverse tail risks, preserved very accommodative financial conditions in all parts of the euro area and leveraged complementarity with other policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.6,0)">But the macroeconomic situation remains fragile and uncertain and the projected inflation path is still clearly short of our aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Our policy must therefore remain forward-looking in terms of how we evaluate and recalibrate the amount of policy support needed, and how we assess and react to the balance of risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">All macroeconomic policies need to consider the horizon of their measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I am now looking forward to hearing your views.</span>
