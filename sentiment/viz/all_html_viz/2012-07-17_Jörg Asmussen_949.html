    <span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)"> Building deeper economic union: what to do and what to avoid Speech by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Policy Briefing at the European Policy Centre, Brussels, 17 July 2012 Ladies and gentlemen, The crisis has made us all a few experiences richer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The question is whether we can draw the right lessons from those experiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.91,0)">After all, “experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.33,0)">And there have been a few mistakes in the way economic poli­cies and governance were managed inside monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Policies and governance clearly needed to be strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.1,0)">What is less clear is how best to do it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What to do and what to avoid is what I would like to discuss today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Thanks for invit­ing me to share my thoughts with you here at the European Policy Centre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Without a doubt: over the past two years, much has happened in the field of economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.73,0)">There have been a lot of pro­posals; the number of suggested Pacts, Com­pacts, Agreements and Treaties is almost in­flationary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">We are having a healthy debate about the future of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.13,0)">But it is not only talk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The report “Towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union” presented to the June Euro­pean Council by the four Presidents van Rompuy, Barroso, Juncker and Draghi sets out a shared vision for EMU over the next decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Its content will be fleshed out over the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.14,0)">But the devil is, of course, in the de­tail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Let me structure my thoughts around three main themes: Are we on the right path with the reforms so far?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Are we tackling the right issues with reflections currently underway?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.39,0)">What does this imply for the ECB?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Are we on the right path with the re­forms so far?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Here in Brussels, much of the attention is natu­rally focused on European institutions and processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">But we should not deceive our­selves: The proper management of euro area economy needs both EU and national action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Any governance process at European level is only as good as its record of actual application.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">That needs determined action by those respon­sible at the EU level – notably the Commission and the Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And of course, implementa­tion at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">On paper, significant progress has been achieved at EU level with the “six pack”, the Fiscal Compact and the 2012 European Se­mester.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">This package of reforms has the po­tential to fundamentally change the way we conduct mutual surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.64,0)">Common over­sight of national economic policies is broader and more intrusive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Take the Commission’s in-depth studies which revealed the existence of various degrees of imbalances in 12 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Or the new more automatic decision-making rules, in particular the “new comply or explain procedure” for the Commission’s country-specific recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These were all premieres.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This procedure puts a great responsibility on the Commission to present accurate recom­mendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It also reinforces the collective re­sponsibility of the Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Last but by no means least, the European Par­liament introduces a degree of openness into the policy discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">It has conducted two economic dialogues with national finance Ministers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Our democracies require and de­serve this additional layer of common public scrutiny of the economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">So far, so good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But none of this is worth the great fanfare, if it remains without conse­quences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Member States have to address the identified problems through determined re­forms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Unfortunately, the past track record of imple­mentation of recommendation has not been very good in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.17,0)">Many Member States accumulated large fiscal and economic imbal­ances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.96,0)">Essential structural reforms had been postponed because of resistance of vested in­terests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.03,0)">The political costs were seen as too high, and the pressure from the EU level as too intangible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.98,0)">Multilateral efforts, such as the Lisbon Strategy or the Europe 2020 pro­gramme have been not effective in stimulating reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.87,0)">Why was this?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.9,0)">I see two main weaknesses: First, excessive politeness and the principle of non-intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.09,0)">Second, a misunderstanding of the principle of equal treatment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me take them in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.23,0)">Much has been written about the “excessive politeness” and the culture of non-intervention among Ministers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And, indeed also on “pre-emptive obedience” on the part of the Com­mission when presenting its proposals and rec­ommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.16,0)">But this lack of peer pressure among decision-makers has real costs – as we had to learn painfully during this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.28,0)">And, it seems, the lesson still has not been learnt completely: deadlines for the correction of ex­cessive deficits are being relaxed; the correc­tive tools that are available even under the new procedures, are simply not being used as the cases of Spain and Cyprus in the recently con­ducted macroeconomic imbalance procedure illustrate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">If mutual surveillance is meant to be effective, this needs to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.3,0)">Second, differentiation among countries is still largely a no-go area in economic surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">And this despite the fact that the crisis has am­ply demonstrated the detrimental effect of ex­cessive divergence and heterogeneity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.23,0)">Coun­tries are different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The severity of imbalances varies, and so does the urgency to address those vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">They need to be treated differently under the governance procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is self-defeating to treat all countries similarly, for sake of alleged consistency, equal treat­ment or avoidance of stigma effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.93,0)">We all know that inappropriate policies in some euro area countries create negative ex­ternalities for the rest of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.47,0)">And we cannot afford to allow some euro area countries to run policies which create a burden on others and destabilise the whole of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This begs the most important question in the debate: Are we at the end of the road with EU coordination?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Do we need a qualitative leap forward?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Is it time for a transfer of competen­cies to the European level?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">This leads me to my second point: Are we tackling the right issues in the ongoing reflections?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The report “Towards a genuine Economic and Monetary Union” presented to the June Euro­pean Council provides an answer to this ques­tion implicitly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The report recognises that we are at a crossroads and states upfront: “ na­tional policies cannot be decided in isolation if their effects quickly propagate to the euro area as a whole   there have to be ways on ensuring compliance when there are negative effects on other EMU members.” The vision for the future of EMU is built around four building blocks: integrated financial market, budgetary and economic policy frameworks as well as strengthened democratic legitimacy and accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">This is very much what we at the ECB had been suggesting, motivated by three reasons: First, a shared vision of EMU ten years down the road will anchor expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The euro is here to stay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This should miti­gate doubts about the survival or integrity of our currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is a clear signal to the markets: underestimate the degree of politi­cal commitment to the single currency at your own risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Second, the four building blocks present a holistic view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.53,0)">Policy-makers have under­stood that the time for partial solutions, for tinkering at the edges, is over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.68,0)">“Muddling through”, with hesitant and incomplete steps at each and every summit, will no longer do the trick.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Progress needs to be achieved on all four fronts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Third, it is acknowledged that euro area countries need a strong institutional frame­work which is commensurate with their high degree of economic and financial in­terdependence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The problems in Greece did not spill-over to its geographically closest EU neighbours in south-eastern Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.5,0)">The contagion channel from Greece did not lead to Bulgaria or Romania but the western Mediterranean were affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The deeper union in the euro area is necessary and is not in contradiction with the process of in­tegration among all 27 EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">This longer-term vision has now to be turned into a fully-fledged roadmap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Mat­ters are moving forward, in a very concrete manner, especially with regard to the crea­tion of a financial market union with a uni­fied supervisor, involving the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This brings me to my third point: What does it imply for the ECB?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The Commission will present proposals on the basis of Article 127  after the summer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Natu­rally, also the ECB Governing Council has started its own reflections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.26,0)">But here again, there are things to do, and things to avoid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The ECB stands ready to play a role of super­visor for the banks of the euro area as re­quested.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">But it is of utmost importance that this framework allows the ECB to act with ef­fectiveness, independence and without risks to its reputation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We will need strict arrangements to safeguard the independence of the ECB’s monetary pol­icy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Moreover, with the new tasks, higher standards of democratic accountability will have to be fulfilled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">We are fully aware of that and stand ready to satisfy them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.66,0)">Carrying out of the new supervisory task will be challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">But its implementation will be greatly facilitated by the fact that the ECB can count on the central banks of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Most of them are already responsible for banking supervision in their own countries and have a full wealth of expertise and knowledge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.62,0)">To say that the task ahead is complex is prob­ably the understatement of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But we have to get it right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Even if it means that we need more time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me also stress that unified supervision is only the starting point of a financial market union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The latter should also provide for com­mon mechanisms to resolve banks and to guarantee customer deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.45,0)">This is necessary to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns which is at the source of the fragil­ity of the euro area financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">You are surely aware of the public debate about banking union that is currently raging: we see open letters by economists for example, which can be very influential on the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.36,0)">Although it is not always clear, if these academics are aware of the responsibility they have in public debate, because they seem to either deliberately or light-heartedly blur the facts and play with clichés.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The steps we are about to take are very significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This is why it is good to have this debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">But there should be no hesitation that – ultimately – we need to take those steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This leads me to my conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Conclusion The core of the current debate about the future of economic union has a name: the further sharing of sovereignty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">It means endowing the euro area with the power to effectively prevent and cor­rect unsustainable policies in every euro area Member State.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Concretely, this would imply that a euro area authority would have compe­tence to limit countries’ ability to issue debt and have intervention rights into national budgets, and to compel Member States to cor­rect their policies, be that in the fiscal, struc­tural and financial fields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.2,0)">Intervention rights into national policies would be confined to cases where policies substan­tially deviate from agreed reform commit­ments and pose a serious risk to the smooth functioning of the EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Those powers would have to be strongly le­gitimised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Whatever we do as further integra­tive steps, we need to strengthen democratic legitimacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Deeper euro area integration can only be sustainable with corresponding pro­gress on democratic legitimacy and accounta­bility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.0,0)">Incidentally, it should not be the central bank that continuously emphasises this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Already now, steps could be taken to better in­volve the national parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.17,0)">Domestic par­liamentary debate and political decision-making needs to internalise what it means to be part of monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.71,0)">If one looks at any of the national media, and the discourse of the domestic debates, one can see how sorely this is missing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.89,0)">EU recommendations are often perceived as a “Brussels diktat”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This must be overcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">One idea to ensure that would be for the Commission to present the country-specific policy recommendations to national parliaments and social partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This would foster a political debate and na­tional ownership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Another one would be to disentangle more clearly in communication that reform requested by Brussels are actually improving social justice, for example, more ef­ficient tax system, or the end to rent-seeking by vested interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.86,0)">Those policy prescriptions are not only about austerity, which gives them a negative connotation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">When governments implement the Commission recommendations they do this not only to “comply with Brussels” but for the good of their own countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">I look forward to a stimulating debate.</span>
