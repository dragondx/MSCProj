    <span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)"> The Process of Economic, Monetary and Financial Integration in Europe Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBJean Monnet Memorial Lecture European Business School London, 29 November 2006 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great privilege and pleasure to be invited to deliver this lecture here at the European Business School in London and to be among such a distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">I am particularly moved to be here under the “invocation” of Jean Monnet: one of the founding fathers of the European Union, a visionary who realised that peace, prosperity and stability in Europe called for practical and close cooperation between European nations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">He is the man who conceived the “méthode communautaire”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In his Mémoires he recalls his early years working for the family’s cognac business in London; it formed part of the global education that the provincial business required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">He says in his Mémoires that it was perhaps his innate French imagination and enthusiasm tempered by an acquired British pragmatism that enabled him to be so active and successful on many historic occasions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">We need Monnet’s spirit and vision more than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Two quotations by him illustrate just how visionary and practical he was: “We are here to accomplish a common endeavour, not to negotiate advantages but to realise that our advantage depends on the success of our common advantage.” He also said: “Let us make our present endeavour a success and let us not be guided by the opinion of others or by what others would like us to do.” Not to forget the biblical quotation   which ends one of his memoranda: “Where there is no vision, the people perish.” Let me also pay homage here to my predecessor, Willem F. Duisenberg, who delivered the Jean Monnet Memorial Lecture here at the EBS in 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">On that occasion, he observed that “While remarkable success has been achieved, one should not forget that many challenges, as well as opportunities, lie ahead.” It is about this success, these opportunities and these challenges that I would like to talk now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">I intend to draw five provisional lessons from the process of economic, monetary and financial integration in Europe: First, our monetary policy concept has proved effective and credible; Second, the single currency has done much to foster economic and financial integration; Third, I will present some additional reasons to stress particularly financial integration; Fourth, large continent-wide economies like the euro area or the US always show a multidimensional diversity as regards growth, inflation and unit labour costs; and Fifth, an appropriate monitoring of the evolution of various competitiveness indicators is necessarily part of the good governance of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The first lesson reflects the fact that we now benefit from the highly credible monetary integration of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Our monetary policy strategy is based on a clear price stability objective and on an economic and a monetary analysis – the two pillars of our strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">What this means is that we undertake a very thorough and ongoing economic analysis of short and medium-term price developments based on a host of price and wage indices, and indicators of economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Over this horizon, price developments are largely due to the interplay of supply and demand in the goods, services and factors markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">We cross-check the results of this analysis with the analysis of monetary developments, of M3, of components and counterparts of M3, which are oriented towards the medium and longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This approach has served us well and has, in particular, provided a strong support to the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">We have also been innovative and transparent from the start.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The ECB was the first major central bank to publish a detailed explanation of its diagnosis and of the reasons for its decisions immediately after its meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In addition, it was the first major central bank, and is still the only one, to convene a monthly press conference on the decisions of the Governing Council immediately after they are taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Indeed, we devote a lot of time to explaining and discussing our framework and actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The monthly Press Conference is a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">We also engage in a continuing dialogue with communities such as academics, European institutions and other policy-makers , ECB-watchers, journalists and the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The high degree of transparency and credibility that we have achieved has in turn helped us to successfully anchor inflation expectations in the euro area and to make monetary policy more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The ECB inherited the high level of credibility of the most stable legacy currencies, itself the achievement of many years of successful monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">From the outset, the ECB has managed to fully consolidate that inheritance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This was clearly demonstrated when the euro was launched, when market interest rates on instruments denominated in euro became aligned with the lowest – and not with the average – rates prevailing prior to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.17,0)">And this happened all along the yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This was an important improvement of their financial environment for the countries which had experienced high risk premia and higher interest rates in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.14,0)">The euro also removed the nominal exchange rate volatility and periodical realignments among euro area countries which used to significantly distort their relative competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The euro area was created only eight years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">We are now gaining a better understanding of the effects that it is having on the euro area economies: in a nutshell, the euro is significantly helping to bring euro area economies closer together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">We are now ranking higher in terms of the Optimum Currency Area criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.12,0)">Cast your mind back to the end of 1996, two years before the euro was launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">You might remember what the common wisdom was on this side of the channel at the time … What would one have thought if somebody had said: look, in ten years’ time the President of the ECB will come and tell you that on the 1 January 2007, a 13th country will enter the euro area; that the euro area will have a total population of 315 million people; that the euro is a credible currency which has kept inflation in line with its definition of price stability; and that the anchoring of inflation expectations fully reflects this credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Also telling you that the promise made to the investors and savers as well as to the people of Europe had been kept, that the new currency is as credible, as confidence-inspiring, as solid as a store of value as were the previous most credible national currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.42,0)">What would have been the reaction of the audience ?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.57,0)">Well, considering how cautious a number of analyses were at that time, one would most probably have thought that it was a fairy tale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The second lesson is that monetary integration is accompanied, and supported, by an increasing degree of economic and financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We have often heard the question: what’s so special about a monetary union among countries that are ready for it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Will it bring something that was not there before?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">We know that by moving from several currencies to a single currency many costs are reduced or in some cases may disappear altogether.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The euro has therefore contributed to reducing trading costs both directly and indirectly, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">by removing exchange rate risks and the cost of currency hedging among the legacy currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Information costs have been reduced as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The euro is also enhancing price transparency and discouraging price discrimination: this is helping to reduce market segmentation, and is also fostering competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Hence, the euro is acting as a catalyst for the single market programme while providing a positive impetus to the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Many studies and analyses are now substantiating some of the important effects of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.97,0)">The euro area economies are becoming more interdependent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">We have clear evidence of a significant increase in both intra and extra-euro area trade in goods since the launch of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Exports and imports of goods within the euro area increased from about 26.5% of GDP in 1998 to around 31% in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">This rise in cross-border trade may be partly related to the introduction of the single currency and the increased price and cost transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Over the same period, exports and imports of goods with trading partners outside the euro area rose from about 24% of GDP to almost 30%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This is mainly due to more sustained growth in world GDP, an increase in global trade integration, and a very sizeable increase in trade with the ten new Member States of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">All in all, these developments are particularly noteworthy given the already high degree of openness of the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Trade in services with partners inside and outside the euro area has also increased as a percentage of GDP in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Intra-euro area exports and imports of services increased from about 5% of GDP in 1998 to around 6.5% in 2005, which represents a substantial increase even vis-à-vis extra-euro area exports and imports of services, which rose from about 7.5% to around 9.5% of GDP in the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">And this trend could increase still further with the emergence of a single market for services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Intra-euro area foreign direct investment   has also grown considerably, and is catching up with extra-euro area FD  Altissimo, F., M.
