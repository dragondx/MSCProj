    <span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)"> Towards a banking union – the state of play from the ECB’s perspective Speech by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBHandelsblatt Conference “Banken im Umbruch”Frankfurt, 4 September 2013 Ladies and gentleman, We are about to embark on one of the most deci-sive changes in the history of the European single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">I expect that the European Parliament will approve the legislative proposal for a single supervisory mechanism next week, bringing the effective start of banking supervision at the Euro-pean level in autumn 2014 into sight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The relative calm in the financial markets that has now prevailed for over a year must not mask the huge significance of this project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Only a sound banking sector in Europe can ensure an ample supply of credit to enterprises and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But it would be wrong to believe that the recovery of the banking sector will solely depend on the transfer of banking supervision to the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The single supervisory mechanism is a necessary step towards restoring the health of the banking sector, but it is not sufficient in itself; the need for reform and action in other policy areas has not abated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Nonetheless, the single supervisory mechanism is an essential component of a genuinely European banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">A European banking union in all its aspects forms the prerequisite for a truly integrated European fi-nancial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Who will benefit?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">First, banks, because they will in future be subject to a single regulatory and su-pervisory framework; Second, borrowers, because they will once again be assessed by their creditworthiness rather than by their location; Third, taxpayers, because they will no longer be first in line to pick up the bill in the event of bank failures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">All of this will help to restore confidence in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Banks will be able to resume their core business, supplying credit to the real econo-my, offering secure savings accounts and making sure that payments are conducted safely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Especially at this formative stage, we must now lay proper foundations to enable the banking union to fulfil these high expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">We want a banking union that will be resilient to future crises and will ideally prevent them from arising in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Given the at times differing national interests, the project will not sell itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">So we are seriously committed to the preparatory work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Today I would like to review the state of play and take a look ahead to the single supervisory mechanism, presenting my view of what still needs to be fine-tuned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.2,0)">Let me start with banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The single supervisory mechanism – where do we stand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">If, as I said, the European Parliament approves the legislative proposal for a single supervisory mech-anism next week, we can begin exercising this single supervision in autumn 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">We will thereby create a level playing field for all banks in the euro area, because the same standards will apply overall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">For cross-border banks espe-cially, it will be simpler when they need only ad-here to one framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">And banking groups operating in several euro area countries will immediately enjoy more scope in their liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.11,0)">European supervision also means that banks will no longer be obliged to hold national assets against national liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Particularly in the years of the financial market crisis, this nationally oriented supervision contrib-uted to the increasing renationalisation of the fi-nancial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Our aim, however, is exactly the opposite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It may sound very straightforward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">But we still need to resolve some highly practical issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">For example, where can we quickly find suitable staff for the single supervisory mechanism?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Or who will bear the costs if we come across prob-lems when carrying out the planned balance sheet assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Some questions can only be answered once the legislative process has been finalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">But our preparations are already advancing at full steam.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">As soon as the legislation is in place, we will start to recruit experts and managers for the single su-pervisory mechanism, which I assume will number no less than 1,000 employees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Some 700 of those employees will be directly en-trusted with banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">At present, close on 80 staff members of national supervisory au-thorities are helping us for the transition period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">They have been specially seconded to the ECB for this purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Our internal preparations are concentrated on four main areas: • First, the construction of a database with in-formation on all euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">With the help of this comprehensive overview of the banking system, we will then decide which banks will be directly supervised by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Our current estimate is that around 130 banks and banking groups will come under direct supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These banks cover around 85% of euro area bank assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">• Second, the reporting to the single superviso-ry mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">In order to harmonise the data collection we have drawn up extensive guidelines, which are now being tested in a pilot study.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">• Third, a uniform supervisory model, which will lay down how the different layers – na-tional and European – will work together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">We aim to form a team of national and European supervisors for each banking group we supervise so that both sides will benefit from each other’s know-how.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Prior to the finalisation of the detailed rules of this supervisory model, a public consulta-tion will be held this autumn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">• Fourth, a comprehensive assessment of the banks that will be directly supervised by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">As this comprehensive assessment – which will involve a risk assessment, balance sheet assessment and a stress test – is current-ly attracting most attention, I would like to deal with it in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">For it makes clear that the banking union can only be a success if we take the correct approach from the out-set.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">For various reasons, two stress tests have not led to a restoration of confidence in the Euro-pean banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.44,0)">This will be our third and last chance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Before launching the single supervisory mecha-nism, we should know the state of the banks that we will be supervising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We want to be free of old liabilities when we take on our new task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">But it is also beneficial for the supervised banks themselves for us to have a clear picture of the health of each individual institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">By performing the comprehensive assessment we will provide transparency for investors – and that is exactly what is required to sustainably reinforce confidence in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.38,0)">The average price/book ratio for large and com-plex banking groups in the euro area is currently just over 0.5.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.45,0)">This reflects the opinion of investors that banks overestimate the value of their assets, will not deliver the expected rate of return or will require fresh capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.63,0)">Moreover, confidence in the banking sector is much lower in some euro area countries than in others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.59,0)">That also causes fragmentation in the single mar-ket, as reflected in the difficulties some banks face in obtaining market funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The results of our “inventory” are then incorpo-rated in a stress test, which the European Banking Authority   will perform in close cooperation with us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Our staff members are now elaborating the methodical details of the comprehensive assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The final decisions will be made as soon as the legislation comes into effect and the decision-making Supervisory Board is in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">To enable the Supervisory Board to start operating promptly, the Chair and Vice-Chair should be ap-pointed as soon as possible after the final adoption of the legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We should now consider how to deal with any weak spots that are revealed during the assess-ment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Funding for any capital shortfalls should preferably come from the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.49,0)">But we also need a backstop in the event that some banks fail to raise the necessary capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is the only way to credibly perform the bal-ance sheet assessment and stress test.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.93,0)">Otherwise we may be accused of glossing over the results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.98,0)">The whole point of the exercise, however, is to look the whole truth in the face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.1,0)">That is why we need such a backstop, before we even start the ex-ercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">In the final statement of their most recent summer, the Heads of State and Government re-ferred to “appropriate measures” before the finali-sation of the assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Ideally, a credible and robust backstop should be in place before the start of the assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Banks should recapitalise themselves through the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">In case that route fails in individual cases, a safety net is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Initially, the respective euro area Member States are responsible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.11,0)">The banking union is not a back-door transfer union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Every institution should cover its own former lia-bilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">If both these options – private sector and national budgets – are exhausted, the existing Eu-ropean Stability Mechanism   could step in, as it did last summer in Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">At this point I would like to clarify that this back-stop should not be confused with the direct bank recapitalisation through the ESM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">With the excep-tion of very rare and highly unlikely cases, direct bank recapitalisation via the ESM will only be available once the single supervisory mechanism is operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I would like to look more closely at two points that I find especially important in relation to the transfer of banking supervision to the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.24,0)">First, monetary policy and banking supervision should not lead to a conflict of interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">On the contrary, central banks have an interest in stable financial markets, not least for the proper functioning of their monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It may therefore make sense to assign banking supervision to the central bank alongside monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.68,0)">A possible consequence of having banking super-vision and monetary policy under the same roof may be that supervisors shy away from placing a bank into resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">After all, the central bank could postpone such de-cisions by providing liquidity support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.03,0)">That is the reproach made by some critics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">However, such conflicts of interest can be avoided by setting out strict conditions and clear rules for the combination of monetary policy and banking supervision in a single institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The legislative proposal for the single supervisory mechanism provides for a far-reaching separation between banking supervision and monetary policy within the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">In many Member States, banking supervision is already assigned to the central bank ¬– with good results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Second, single banking supervision must be democratically legitimised and subject to control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The single supervisory mechanism is therefore ac-countable to European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">That goes beyond the accountability we have for our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">We will work out the optimal form of the new accountability obligations in cooperation with the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.24,0)">Banking resolution – what remains to be done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">A rigorous comprehensive assessment before the start of the single supervisory mechanism can strengthen confidence in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.78,0)">However, that is no more than a momentary effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We can only secure long-term – and, above all, sustainable investor confidence – if we, as the banking supervisor, may in future also decide that a bank is no longer viable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">And may do so in a way that does not set off shock waves across the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We therefore require clear rules that are valid throughout Europe – rules on the or-derly resolution of banks and rules on who will cover the ensuing costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">The EU Council of Ministers has already agreed on a framework for the resolution and recovery of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">I hope that the legislative process, too, may now be swiftly brought to a conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The idea underlying these new rules is simple and makes good sense: whoever takes on a risk must also take the responsibility for the consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In future, the costs of wrong decisions will not be borne by taxpayers alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Shareholders will be the first in line, followed by creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.11,0)">Within the pecking order of creditors, subordinated creditors will come first and then preferred creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.19,0)">Only then will it be the unsecured depositors’ turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.2,0)">This clear pecking order represents a major break-through: “bail-out” is out, “bail-in” is in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">For a truly integrated European financial market we need to remove the tight links between banks and sovereigns along national lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">When the new resolution rules come into effect, states may only intervene after private investors have been bailed-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This is a sound approach, because the clear rules ensure that investors can, and must, properly estimate their risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">As I see it, however, the current compromise leaves countries with quite some room to manoeu-vre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The representatives of the European Parlia-ment, the Council and the Commission should im-prove this aspect during their negotiations in the Conciliation Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.23,0)">The bail-in rules are not due to take effect until 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">I hope that the trialogue is able to bring this date forward in order to give more security to in-vestors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">A single resolution mechanism, along with a sin-gle resolution authority and a single resolution fund for the supervised banks, is just as important as the single supervisory mechanism itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The European Commission has presented a legislative proposal under which this mechanism could be-come fully operational as of 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">I’m greatly in favour of this ambitious schedule, which does jus-tice to the urgency of the project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The ECB will shortly publish an opinion on the Commission’s proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Without wishing to antic-ipate this detailed analysis, I would like to share a few thoughts with you on a good way of designing this mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The proposal covers the core elements required to resolve failing banks efficiently, whilst minimising costs for taxpayers and the real economy: a single system with a single authority and a single bank resolution fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It is right and important that resolution decisions will be taken at European level, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">at the same level at which supervision will be exercised in fu-ture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.15,0)">Quick and efficient decisions will enable the closure of credit institutions that are no longer viable – without impairing the stability of the rest of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.28,0)">But who will actually decide that a bank is no longer viable?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">In answering this question I see that the current proposal still needs to be improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.0,0)">In my view, such a decision should be made solely by the banking supervisor, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">in future by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">This would allow for rapid, coordinated decisions, and subsequent action, without unnecessary dis-putes about competencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.25,0)">Once the decision has been made that a bank is no longer viable, the res-olution authority could take over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It would then decide how to carry out the resolution in that par-ticular case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Such a clear division of tasks makes good sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Let me add, however, that the resolution fund will be financed through contributions from the bank-ing sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Moreover, when banking supervision and resolu-tion are brought to the European level, a single European deposit guarantee scheme will be less urgent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.62,0)">Because thanks to the pecking order laid down in the Bank Re¬solution and Recovery Directive, less funds will be required for the compensation of de-positors in extreme cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">For one, the framework for the recovery and resolution of banks, that is due to be adopted shortly, provides that depositors will be treated favourably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.27,0)">So the need to compensate depositors will more rarely arise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">That means that national deposit guarantee schemes will only need to be invoked in absolutely extreme cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">In addition, the revision of the Directive on Deposit Guarantee Schemes aims to harmonise national deposit guarantee schemes and to provide them with more resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Both aspects will help ensure that the national deposit guarantees have sufficient funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">A European banking union is the prerequisite for a genuinely integrated European financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">That is also crucial for us as a central bank as only then can our monetary policy signals be properly transmitted throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">A single financial market is the prerequisite for the uniform transmission of our interest rate decisions to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">A banking union is a central element of a stable euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">It stands for a Europe that has learnt the right les-sons from the crisis; for a Europe that will come out of the crisis stronger and more robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The banking union is in Europe’s interest – and it is in Germany’s interest too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Many thanks for your attention.</span>
