    <span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)"> Swiss monetary policy as viewed by the European Central Bank Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBon the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Swiss National Bank on 22 June 2007 in Zurich Madame la Présidente de la Confédération suisse, Monsieur le Président du Gouvernement du Liechtenstein, Ministers, Excellencies, Dear President of the Bank Council of the Swiss National Bank, Dear Jean-Pierre Roth, Dear Chairman of the Governing Board of the Swiss National Bank, Dear fellow Governors, Ladies and gentlemen, It is an immense pleasure for me to be here today with such a distinguished audience to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the foundation of the Swiss National Bank  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The SNB is to be especially congratulated because, in spite of the turbulences which have characterised the period since 1907 – two world wars, the Great Depression, and the Great Inflation – it has succeeded in delivering, on average, a remarkably low inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">I regard a historical and international perspective on Swiss price stability as being especially appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">A historical and international perspective: a low-inflation country It has been noted that, notwithstanding the Great Inflation episode, and the temporary inflationary outbursts corresponding to the two world wars, the United States should correctly be characterised, when seen from a very long-run perspective, as a low-inflation country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.72,0)">This is a claim made, in particular, by Bradford DeLong in his analysis of the US inflationary experience since the time of the Civil War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Historical experience suggests that Switzerland deserves such a characterisation to a significantly greater extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.87,0)">First, since 1880 Swiss annual inflation has been, on average, just 2.2%, to be compared to 2.6% in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Second, in an international comparison with 13 other OECD countries since 1880, and excluding from the computation the years corresponding to the First and Second World Wars and their immediate aftermath  , Switzerland comes out on top once again, with an annual average inflation rate of just 1.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Finally, focusing on the period following the creation of the Swiss National Bank, and excluding, once again, the years of the two world wars and their immediate aftermath, Switzerland, with an average annual inflation rate of 2.1% is, together with Germany, again the best performer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Switzerland’s consistent “credible currency, low-inflation” strategy clearly emerged during the episode which can reasonably be characterised as the Swiss National Bank’s “finest hour”: the Great Inflation of the 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.51,0)">As pointed out by Edward Nelson  , “ n Switzerland,   while a debate on the nature of inflation did take place in the early 1970s, it was resolved quite rapidly in favor of the monetary view, leading to an eschewing of non-monetary approaches to inflation control”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In subscribing to the ultimately monetary nature of inflation, the Swiss National Bank was accepting the lesson of Milton Friedman as remarkably exposed in the Monetary History of the United States  , the single piece of research which – more than any other – contributed to changing policy making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">And indeed, as emphasised by Robert Lucas in the remarks he delivered at Otmar Issing’s Festschrift one year ago  , “ he first central banks to deal effectively with the 1970s inflation were the Bundesbank and the Swiss National Bank, and both did so in the mid-1970s by deliberate reductions in money growth rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In October 1979 the US Federal Reserve followed suit  .” Monetary policy and monetary aggregates As stressed by Lucas, recalling the Swiss National Bank’s – and the Bundesbank’s, as well as a number of European central banks’, including Banque de France’s –acceptance, back in the 1970s, of the ultimately monetary nature of inflation, and their use of monetary means to bring it under control, is especially important today, when the relevance of monetary analysis for monetary policy is sometimes questioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.02,0)">As Charles Goodhart sarcastically put it   “ onetarism, in any of its guises, has become somewhat unfashionable; and the New Keynesian three-equation synthesis   rides high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.57,0)">Deviate from this, and you are not a member of the In Crowd.” The reasons why the role of monetary aggregates in monetary policy analysis is today questioned are well known.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">On the conceptual front, the ascendancy of Neo-Wicksellian theory   which assigns to monetary aggregates a purely residual role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.71,0)">At the practical level, the breakdown, in several countries, of the empirical relationship between money growth and inflation, which led the former Governor of the Bank of Canada, Gerald Bouey, to famously quip that “ We didn’t abandon monetary aggregates, they abandoned us”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I have three comments on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.32,0)">First, empirical evidence   shows that – since the first half of the nineteenth century, and in a number of countries – fluctuations in trend money growth have almost always led to fluctuations in trend inflation, with upswings or downswings in trend money growth having been followed, a few years later, by upswings or downswings in trend inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The crucial point to stress here is that the resilience of the lead of trend money growth over trend inflation over time, and across radically different monetary regimes, clearly suggests that such a lead is a structural feature of the economy – that is, embedded in the structure of the system so as to be invariant to occasional changes in the monetary regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This empirical finding represents a bedrock fact that any model – including those built on New-Keynesian synthesis principles – has to confront and seek to reproduce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.77,0)">Since, over the last two centuries, fluctuations in trend money growth have almost always been followed by fluctuations in trend inflation in the same direction, an upswing in trend money growth points to the existence of upward medium to long term risks to the inflation profile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.27,0)">In the light of the evidence coming from the last two centuries of data, totally ignoring trend movements in money growth would therefore entail – in my view – excessive and unreasonable risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The practice of the SNB – and of the ECB – of closely monitoring monetary trends in order to identify long-term risks to price stability is therefore validated by the monetary history of the last 200 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.85,0)">Second, as recently stressed, in particular, by Philippe Hildebrand at a central banking conference at the ECB  , prolonged periods of low and stable inflation – like those that OECD countries have been experiencing for several years now – can give rise to distortions in empirical analyses, and can make it extremely difficult to correctly assess the informational content of a specific indicator of future inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.22,0)">To put it differently, in an equilibrium in which the central bank is successful at keeping inflation low and within a narrow range, the empirical relationship between inflation and any indicator tends to disappear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is precisely why the experience of the Great Inflation – which can be regarded as the ultimate off-equilibrium event – is important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.07,0)">That persistent and prolonged deviation from equilibrium revealed, in a fundamental sense, the authentic nature of reality, which today, in a stable, low-inflation world, has become more difficult to extract from the data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And so, in the same way as the experience of the Weimar Republic hyperinflation was the key “founding memory” for the Bundesbank, or the dramatic experience of the revolutionary “assignats” for Banque de France,   the experience of the Great Inflation can be regarded by today’s central banks as the cornerstone of their institutional architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.21,0)">Indeed, as pointed out by the Vice Chairman of the Federal Reserve,   “ reater support for independent central banks   was one of the results of the lessons of the great inflation of the 1970s.” Third, it is important to note that the link between money growth and inflation can be blurred by systematic fluctuations in the velocity of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.44,0)">Recent work carried out at the Swiss National Bank   has shown that, after controlling for systematic shifts in the equilibrium component of money velocity caused by Fisherian movements in the opportunity cost of money, the long-run relationship between money growth and subsequent inflation is still in the data, and not only for the euro area, but also for the United States, where the stability of such a relationship has been most strongly questioned in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.27,0)">This finding suggests that monetary indicators should not be hastily discarded when their link with inflation appears to have weakened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Rather, it suggests that monetary data should be subjected to a thorough and broad-based analysis, in order to filter out the noise and to fully understand movements in trend velocity which distort their low-frequency signal for long-term risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The new Swiss monetary policy concept: an ECB perspective From 1974 until the end of the century, the Swiss National Bank consistently pursued a strategy of targeting monetary aggregates, announcing targets first for M1, and then, from 1980, for the monetary base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Owing to the increasing instability of the monetary base over the second half of the 1990s, however, the SNB decided, at the end of 1999, to announce a new monetary policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The new framework is based on three key elements: An
