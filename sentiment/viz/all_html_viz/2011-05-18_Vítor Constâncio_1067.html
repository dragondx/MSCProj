    <span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)"> Strengthening European economic governance – surveillance of fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Brussels Economic Forum, Brussels, 18 May 2011 Thank you very much for the invitation to participate in this panel today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The session is intended to focus on “surveillance of fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances”, which arguably is the most important strand of the economic governance package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">But one should consider that this package – beyond the 6 legislative acts – also contains three other strands: the Euro Plus Pact, the creation of the European Stability Mechanism and the setting-up of the European System of Financial Supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">A fundamental strengthening of economic governance in the euro area requires simultaneous progress in all three areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The first strand is necessary to prevent and correct imbalances; the second to ensure the conditions for future growth and competitiveness; the third to provide a last resort backstop if crises still occur, the fourth to guarantee financial stability, in particular in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">That said, prevention and correction of fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances must be given priority as it is the pre-condition for sustainable economic growth and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">As the ECB has stressed on a number of occasions, here a ‘quantum leap’ forward is needed in strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact and creating an effective new framework for surveillance of macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Important negotiations are ongoing between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament to reach agreement on the legislative package of economic governance reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">For this agreement to reach the necessary ‘quantum leap’, the following elements are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">First, greater automaticity is needed in all surveillance procedures, including the new macroeconomic surveillance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.11,0)">The Council should have less room for halting or suspending procedures against Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.64,0)">Strict deadlines to avoid lengthy procedures and the deletion of escape clauses would also contribute to automaticity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">This is critical to ensure the credibility of the new framework and address spillovers in a timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Second, enforcement tools need to be more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">In addition to financial sanctions, political and reputational measures would help foster early compliance, as would the application of earlier and more gradual financial sanctions within the macroeconomic surveillance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.17,0)">Discretion to reduce or suspend financial sanctions is undesirable as it strongly reduces effectiveness and sets the wrong incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Third, more ambitious policy requirements would better match the current reality of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It makes sense for macroeconomic surveillance to have a clear focus on the euro area countries with large current account deficits, significant losses of competitiveness and high levels of public and private debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">As regards fiscal surveillance, ambitious benchmarks are needed when establishing an excessive deficit and in setting the adjustment path towards a country’s medium-term budgetary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Such benchmarks need to be even more ambitious if a country’s debt exceeds the reference value of 60% of GDP or there are fiscal sustainability risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Finally, the gap between the EU and national level must be closed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.35,0)">New procedures will not be sufficient if they are not solidly anchored at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Binding commitments by Member States to swiftly implement strong national budgetary frameworks are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Major improvements are needed regarding the quality and independence of fiscal and economic analysis and the production of fiscal statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">All these aspects should be contemplated as mandatory features in the foreseen Directive on national fiscal frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.49,0)">In the ECB’s view, the proposals meanwhile agreed do not go far enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Regarding the final result, we are encouraged by the fact that the European Parliament has shown some ambition in its approach, particularly as regards greater automaticity and the broader and timelier use of sanctions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.1,0)">The room for halting or suspending procedures against those Member States breaking the rules must be reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Some other points of the Parliament’s proposals also deserve a positive mention like the strengthening of the Commission’s role in the procedures and an earlier and more gradual application of financial sanctions within the macroeconomic surveillance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">It is also positive the support in the same framework for a clear distinction between Member States belonging or not to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The requirements of avoiding negative imbalances must be more demanding for members of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This type of distinction, making full use of the Treaty’s new Article 136, has to be applied in different domains, drawing the appropriate lessons of the crisis for the functioning of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">We hope that the ongoing negotiations over the legislative package will permit the texts to be significantly improved along these lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The ECB is encouraged that the amendments proposed by the European Parliament go in the direction of the significant strengthening of economic governance that we have called for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">However, there are some important areas in which the texts should not be weakened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.96,0)">In particular, softening the Stability and Growth Pact by introducing further exceptions or treating in a special way specific expenditure items, such as public investment, would create further room for unwarranted discretionary decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">It is also of crucial importance that the economic governance reform is fully implemented as soon as possible and without any transition period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Economic governance is not only about preventing crisis, but also about creating conditions for economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Here the second strand of the economic governance package – the Euro Plus Pact – is important to give renewed impetus to structural reforms and support the ambitious targets of the Europe 2020 Strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.76,0)">On current projections, economic growth in both the EU and euro area is expected to be weak over the next decade, in a large part due to disappointing productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Faced with ongoing debt sustainability challenges and future age-related expenditures, Europe needs to do more to reverse this trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Elevating the growth potential of the euro area through structural reforms is therefore essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Reinforcing economic governance and elevating economic growth cannot exclude the possibility of crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">We would all agree that, even with the best fire-proof materials and state-of-the-art alarms, it is still prudent to employ a fire service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Thus the third part of the package – the creation of the ESM – is appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">However, it should be underscored that the ESM is for the last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Its purpose is to provide temporary bridge funding to solvent but temporarily illiquid countries in financial difficulties, with the aim to create breathing space to implement a deep adjustment programme to correct imbalances and regain market access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Any financing under the ESM needs to be subject to very strong policy conditionality and, in general, should be designed such as to avoid moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">If implemented in a comprehensive and ambitious manner, the overall governance package will ensure competitiveness in the euro area, strengthen its growth potential and contribute to prevent future crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">However, within this package the first priority is prevention and correction of fiscal and macroeconomic imbalances, as this provides the pre-conditions for sustainable growth and financial stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The ECB hopes that policymakers seize this opportunity to place the euro area and its citizens on a prosperous and stable path.</span>
