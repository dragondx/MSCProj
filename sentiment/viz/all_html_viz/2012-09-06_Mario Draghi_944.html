    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)"> For a European Public Space Remarks by Mario Draghi, President of the ECBon receiving the M100 Media Award 2012Potsdam, 6 September 2012 Dear Minister Schäuble, Dear Lord Mayor Jakobs, Dear Mr van Dülmen, Dear Paul Achleitner, Dear Luca di Montezemolo, Distinguished friends, Ladies and gentleman, I am enormously grateful to the Board of M100 Sanssouci Colloquium for bestowing this award on me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">It is an honour to be recognised as a contributor to the European project, and to join the company of such illustrious previous recipients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Working for Europe is not only my profession, but also, on a personal level, a driving mission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">And in these difficult times – when, unfortunately, we are rarely sans souci – striving to build a strong, united and stable Europe is more important than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">I would like to thank Minister Schäuble very warmly for his presence tonight and his very moving speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Wolfgang is among the most important European leaders we have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Over the past 20 years, he has worked relentlessly to advance the cause of European integration, sometimes against strong resistance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Wolfgang does not grow weary of reminding us of the benefits of the European project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">His deeply anchored aspiration “to think Europe further” – Europa weiterzudenken – has been rewarded with the renowned Karlspreis in May this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">We are privileged to have such leaders as him today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">I also would like to thank Potsdam Lord Mayor Jakobs and Mr van Dülmen of the M100 Sanssouci Colloquium for their words and their hospitality and the entire M100 board for their trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">And of course, I would like to thank Paul Achleitner and Luca di Montezemolo for their very kind words in support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">You all have been very generous to me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.87,0)">It is no secret that the course of European integration is currently difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.6,0)">The global economy is facing serious challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These challenges are not all of Europe’s making, as some observers would have us believe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.64,0)">But Europe is perhaps experiencing them more acutely than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.47,0)">The reasons for this are complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.77,0)">But one part of the explanation is clear: the original institutional design of the euro area did not meet expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In the euro area we have a single monetary policy, but our economic and financial policies are only loosely coordinated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">This is because the euro area is a union of nation-states with strong national traditions and preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">While there was sufficient consensus to share a currency, economic and financial policies remained organised largely at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.51,0)">The global crisis has revealed the vulnerabilities in this arrangement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Loose coordination of policies neither ensures stability nor does it facilitate effective crisis management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">The institutional design of the euro area therefore has to be reviewed to put our economic and monetary union   on a more secure footing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.34,0)">But how should this be done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">There are two possible paths.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The first is to go “back to the past”, to make the original design work better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">The second is to develop a new architecture that properly reflects lessons of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.17,0)">In my view, the first path is not viable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.11,0)">We have seen that the euro area is too interconnected for economic and financial policies to be a purely national responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We must find ways to guarantee that national decisions do not harm other members of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In the event of a crisis, there should be effective mechanisms for crisis management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And where necessary, this means going beyond coordination, because this is a matter of europäische Innenpolitik.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">We have also seen that maintaining stability requires common institutions that can react to events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The euro is the world’s second most important currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It makes up 25% of the world’s foreign exchange reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">1.5 trillion euros are traded daily on the world’s foreign exchange markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And it is used daily by the 330 million citizens of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">A currency that plays a central role in the lives of so many people has to be managed with effective decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The second path, designing a new architecture, is therefore the only way forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The key challenge today is to present a vision to Europe’s citizens of what this would entail – which is precisely the theme of this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Together with the Presidents of the European Council, the European Commission and the Eurogroup, I have been given the task of working on such a vision for the next decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">We have aimed to be as pragmatic as possible: to establish what are the minimum requirements to make the euro function to its full potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">And our conclusions are both realistic and attainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Member States will have to pool more sovereignty in selected policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This is a clear lesson of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But we will not need to cede all powers to Brussels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Sovereignty will only be pooled where it is essential to ensure a stable and prosperous monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">This will be accompanied by broad democratic participation and legitimation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Our vision for EMU has four pillars – fiscal union, financial union, economic union and political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Progress on all four should be made simultaneously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">The first three pillars will help to steer fiscal, financial and economic policies in a sustainable way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">They will also help to create institutions commensurate with the degree of monetary integration in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But today I would like to focus briefly on the fourth pillar, political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">This pillar is essential for engaging euro area citizens more deeply and making the other three pillars legitimate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Some observers argue that because of the common decision-making implied by the other three pillars, political union has to come first.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.33,0)">I do not agree.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Political integration can and will develop in parallel with economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Over the past 60 years of European integration, this has always been the sequence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">For example, public engagement with euro area issues has naturally deepened through responding to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.62,0)">To commit money via the European Stability Mechanism, Member States have had to explain the responsibilities of euro membership to their citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Parliaments are now taking a sharper interest in European affairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Closer economic integration has de facto strengthened democratic engagement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">But this does not mean that we should not strive to strengthen democratic participation in Europe further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Democratic engagement already takes place through the Council of Ministers – where citizens are represented by elected ministers – and the European Parliament – where citizens elect their MEPs directly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">But more has to be done to make the voice of Europe’s citizens heard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We need what in Germany is called demokratische Teilhabe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And this is where you are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">I would like to ask all of you – journalists and publishers but also policy makers and academics – to help to develop a genuine European public space, eine europäische Öffentlichkeit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Most of us in Europe are exposed mainly to our national media in our national languages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.04,0)">These media naturally define our perspective: our sense of the “public” tends to stop at national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.21,0)">But this no longer describes reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.45,0)">What is happening in other Member States matters to all of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Problems that cross borders require citizens to find consensus around common solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.13,0)">Again, the crisis is itself having an effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">For example, newspapers in some countries now take a keen interest in the welfare systems of other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.97,0)">Citizens closely follow the elections of ministers they would previously have never heard of.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.35,0)">Certainly, there is an unwelcome side to this related to the potential for reviving outdated national stereotypes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">But there is also a positive side insofar as it leads citizens in the euro area to develop a sense of belonging together and to care about decisions in other regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">One way to strengthen this trend would be to exchange more media between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And here I would like to invite your contribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Could you consider, for example, publishing what we might call “imported pages” from foreign newspapers?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">This would allow citizens to get a better sense of how issues are seen in other countries; it would increase cultural sensitivity; and it could generate Europe-wide debates that divide along policy lines rather than national lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Over time, such debate would help to put European decision-making on a more legitimate footing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">“Imported pages” are but one idea, a starting point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">It is with your dedication and creativity that more such ideas can be developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is a privilege to be part of the European project, for citizens and journalists alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.96,0)">But it is also comes with responsibilities, for citizens and journalists alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Ultimately, a genuine European public space is essential for supporting the long-term vision of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Citizens need to be in basic agreement that, within a monetary union, certain economic models are no longer possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">They must understand that there are limits to national discretion in economic policies that affect the area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">In other words, there needs to be a new consensus on economic policies that will reinvigorate the European social model and make it fit for the 21st century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is a discussion we must begin today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Setting EMU on a path towards stability is essential so that we can move permanently beyond the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">It will send a clear signal to citizens and financial markets that the euro area is committed to staying the course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And it will remove any grounds for doubting the euro’s future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">There are many reasons to be optimistic that Europe will find this path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The pattern over recent decades has always been to move forward towards a stronger and more united Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">When we have faced challenges, we have invariably found solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.4,0)">Those who have predicted the worst have turned out to be mistaken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">What’s more, the solutions we need do not require extreme approaches or impossible choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">They require a structured and achievable path towards completing EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This is fully within our reach today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">I am confident that one day I can return to this beautiful historical setting sans souci.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">In the meantime, I am most grateful for your support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Thank you once again for this award and your kind words tonight and thank you very much for your attention.</span>
