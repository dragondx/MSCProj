    <span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)"> Building Europe in a globalised world Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBChallenges of the Twenty-first Century:European and American Perspectives Series at Harvard University Boston, 23 October 2007 Introduction   It is a great pleasure for me to be invited to Harvard University to talk about a key issue: how can Europe best adapt to a globalised world?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me start by saying that the idea of the European Union and the concept of the single currency originated about 50 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">They resulted from a desire of European nations to create conditions for lasting peace and prosperity after the two devastating wars of the first half of the 20th century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Initially, the prime focus of intra-European policies was on how to facilitate the free flow of goods, services, capital and people across national frontiers, an initiative which was to become the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Serving as a role model in the creation of such a genuine common market in Europe was the unified market of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Today, the EU is considerably larger than it was all those years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It comprises 27 European countries and a population totalling 494 million people, with Romania and Bulgaria joining in January this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">13 of these countries are members of the Economic and Monetary Union   and have introduced the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.14,0)">The 13 will become 15 in January next year, when Cyprus and Malta join.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Importantly, the impressive enlargement of the EU and the successful creation of the euro area have gone hand in hand with Europe’s integration into the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Globalisation provides great opportunities for flexible economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">However, Europe still needs to make progress in this field in order to fully gain from globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This brings me to the issue I would like to address today, namely the building of Europe in a globalised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">First, I would like to share with you some thoughts on Europe in a global context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Second, I would like to provide some facts on the process of economic and financial integration in Europe and – as a comparison – the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Finally, I would like to talk about how globalisation influences European macroeconomic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Europe and globalisation Globalisation has indeed increased significantly over the last couple of decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me first present some figures on the degree of global openness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Thereafter, I would like to provide some examples of the impact of globalisation, especially on Europe’s economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Global trade openness – measured as world exports and imports of goods and services as a share of world GDP – has practically doubled over the last 20 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In 1986 it accounted for 34% of world GDP; in 2006 the figure was 61%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">A key factor has been the increase in trade in intermediate goods and services as a result of the rising internationalisation of production processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.06,0)">Financial systems have also been deeply affected by globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The share of gross international asset holdings in world GDP – which provides a measure of financial openness – has grown eightfold over the last 25 years and now stands at more than 130% of world GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Globalisation is triggering major transformations all over the world, not only in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.47,0)">For instance, globalisation has had an impact on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Economic theory has identified numerous channels through which globalisation can influence price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Without doubt, globalisation and the associated rise in world trade have contributed to import price moderation  , notably in the manufacturing sector, which is primarily due to increased imports from low-cost countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.83,0)">Furthermore, the widespread opening-up of emerging countries and of almost all former centrally planned economies has significantly increased the labour pool available, leading to dampening pressures on labour costs, especially for unskilled labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.37,0)">Globalisation can also exert indirect downward pressure on inflation, as increasing international competition may limit the pricing power of domestic corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.38,0)">However, at the same time, the sudden emergence of fast-growing economies in the global economy is exerting very significant upward pressures on commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This has been particularly visible since 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In addition, the prices of certain agricultural products have also risen recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Despite intensive research, there remains significant uncertainty about the overall role and impact of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.14,0)">Even though the net effect of these counterbalancing forces is mostly believed to have reduced the level and volatility of inflation, how long this disinflationary effect will last remains an open question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Still, in view of the much lower price levels of the economies in emerging markets, they are expected to increase their market shares in the developed economies, which in turn will help to contain import price pressures there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Ultimately, globalisation is an opportunity, not a threat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Globalisation fosters economic prosperity and raises living standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">It may facilitate increased labour inflows to the euro area, which, in certain sectors, would help to reduce bottlenecks in labour markets and hence ease wage pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Meanwhile, resources are allocated to the most profitable activities across the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">In addition, globalisation helps to intensify the exchange of investment capital for know-how between regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">As a matter of fact, the euro area has become an attractive place for foreign direct investment  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">IMF statistics reveal that FDI into the euro area amounts to more than 30% of euro area GDP, whereas the comparable figure for the US is 16%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.34,0)">In sum, increasing globalisation leads to structural changes that are sometimes difficult to quantify.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Developed economies need to be sufficiently flexible in order to absorb these structural changes smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Overall, however, these developments should be seen as increasing economic prosperity as they improve the international allocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In addition to globalisation, European countries are facing the challenge of integration in their product, labour and financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">I will turn to these issues now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Economic and financial integration in Europe and a comparison with the United States In a monetary union, economic and financial integration is crucial as it ensures smooth adjustment processes to economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In a monetary union like the United States or the euro area, where regional monetary and exchange rate policies are options that are no longer available, it is important to make sure that other shock adjustment mechanisms function properly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.92,0)">Such mechanisms are needed in order to prevent a country or region from entering into a period of protracted low growth and higher unemployment, or into a long period of overheating, after experiencing a country-specific shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Allow me, now, to elaborate on four main features of economic and financial integration in Europe, namely trade, financial integration, labour mobility and business cycle synchronisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">I will also compare these features with those in the United States, in order to illustrate some of Europe’s achievements and remaining challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">i) First, economic integration has been reflected in a marked increase in intra- euro area trade in goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.44,0)">Let me mention some figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The share of exports and imports of goods in terms of GDP within the euro area increased by 6 percentage points between 1998, the year before the adoption of the euro, and 2006, when it amounted to around 32% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The share of intra-euro area exports and imports of services increased by about 2 percentage points from 1998 to 2006, to almost 7% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">As trade integration within the euro area becomes stronger, the region is also becoming a more open economy to the outside world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The share of extra-euro area exports and imports of goods rose by about 9 percentage points between 1998 and 2006, to around 33% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Over the same period, the share of extra-euro area exports and imports of services increased by about 2 percentage points, to almost 10% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">These developments clearly show that we are not witnessing the creation of a “fortress Europe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">On the contrary, the euro area is a more open economy than the other two G3 economies, the United States and Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the United States, exports and imports of goods represented about 22% of GDP and trade in services 6% in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.31,0)">The corresponding figures for Japan were 27% and 6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">ii) As a second feature, the introduction of the euro has contributed to intra-European financial integration which, in turn, improves the free movement of capital in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Financial integration enhances the efficiency of economic mechanisms, strengthens competition and raises the potential for stronger non-inflationary economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Financial integration also improves the smooth and effective transmission of the single monetary policy throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">More precisely, financial integration helps financial systems to channel funds from those economic agents that have a surplus of savings to those with a shortage; in particular, it enables agents to effectively trade, hedge, diversify and pool risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">As a result, there is a better sharing and diversification of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the US, over the period 1963-90, capital markets smoothed out 39% of the shocks to gross state product  , the credit channel smoothed out 23% and the federal government, through the fiscal channel, 13%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.3,0)">Around 25% of the shocks were not smoothed out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Hence financial markets and financial institutions contributed 62% to the absorption of idiosyncratic state shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We therefore see from the US example that the financial channel can be much more important than the fiscal channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This is an additional reason to speed up financial integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In a more recent study, it was found that the euro area situation has begun to converge towards the situation of the United States and that there is already modest but non-negligible insurance through inter-state capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">It was found that in the euro area  , capital markets would have smoothed out about 10% of the country-specific shocks to GDP between 1993 and 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">A set of indicators published by the ECB also points to an increasing degree of integration of euro area financial and banking markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">For instance, there is significant evidence that euro area corporations are taking advantage of the possibility to raise funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">As a result, the euro corporate bond market has grown significantly since 1999, and has the potential to grow even further, judged by a comparison with the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">In 1999, the outstanding volume of bonds issued by non-financial corporations was just 3.9% of GDP in the euro area and 24.3% in the US; by 2006 it had increased to 12.5%, but relative to GDP the US corporate bond market is still one and a half times larger than that of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Integration in retail banking, by contrast, has been slow so far, although it has picked up in the last two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">There are still differences in bank deposit and lending interest rates across euro area countries, whose cross-country dispersion is higher than the intra-regional dispersion of the same rates in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">However, a number of indicators point to increasing cross-border banking activities in the euro area, such as the growing cross-border share in the financial holdings of banks as well as cross-border mergers and acquisitions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In terms of fiscal transfers, obviously in the US there are inter-regional transfers which add to the degree of integration, while transfers in the euro area are almost exclusively domestic and not cross-border.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">iii) Labour mobility constitutes the third feature of integration that I would like to mention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Labour mobility may dampen the effects from country-specific shocks or decrease the risks of wage pressures as labour markets tighten.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.89,0)">Comparable figures on labour mobility for the euro area and the US are difficult to obtain and any such figures should be interpreted very carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.53,0)">Available evidence suggests that, overall, cross-border labour mobility is still limited in most parts of the European Union with regulatory barriers still existing, and even within the euro area with respect to labour from Slovenia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Linguistic, cultural, legal and other differences between countries and the costs involved in moving residence also play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.83,0)">In the period 2000-2005 only 0.1% of the working-age population of the then EU 15 Member States moved away from their country of origin to another country in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.68,0)">Furthermore, only a small proportion of individuals – 0.4% of the EU’s working-age population – commuted across a national border to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In the US, geographical labour mobility appears to be far higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Evidence suggests that around 3.1% of the country’s total working-age population moved from one state to another each year between 2000 and 2005.   iv) A fourth and final feature of the process of economic and financial integration is the degree of synchronisation or co-movement between different cyclical positions across the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">This degree of synchronisation has increased since the beginning of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In other words, a large number of euro area economies now share similar business cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">In addition, current inflation and output growth differentials between euro area countries are relatively limited compared with the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Indeed, the decline in inflation differentials across the euro area countries has been impressive in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.8,0)">At the beginning of the 1990s, the dispersion in inflation rates across the countries which now belong to the euro area was, on average, around 6 percentage points  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.58,0)">Last year, the inflation dispersion was only 0.7 percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">This implies that dispersion in the euro area is currently broadly in line with inflation dispersion among the 14 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas, where it has fluctuated around 1% in the last two decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.95,0)">Dispersion in real GDP growth rates   across the euro area countries has been fluctuating around a level of 2 percentage points over the past few decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.86,0)">This is similar to the dispersion observed in output growth across regions within the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Still, with a view to further enlargements of the euro area, these issues need to be kept in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">For the proper functioning of the single monetary policy in Europe all participating countries are required to display high degrees of convergence with each other and to do this on a sustainable basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In all enlargement decisions for the euro area, we refer to some clearly defined “convergence criteria” and apply them in a very strict manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">We did so in the past and will do so in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">In sum, there is evidence of growing economic and financial integration among the countries of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The adoption of the euro has particularly contributed to this development by reducing information costs, enhancing price transparency and eliminating exchange rate risk between countries in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Nonetheless, in some fields, Europe is lagging behind the US and a lot remains to be done, for instance, in order to increase labour mobility and financial integration in retail banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Progress in these fields is clearly needed in order to adapt to a globalised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">How globalisation influences European macroeconomic policies As I claimed earlier, globalisation and integration brings clear benefits to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">At the same time, however, European policy-makers need to ensure that Europe quickly adapts to a globalised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Globalisation increases the pressure on national policy-makers to implement reforms and to pursue structural policies that enhance competition and foster flexibility in product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.06,0)">In fact, globalisation brings opportunities for flexible economies but penalises rigid ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In many euro area countries, structural reforms have been too slow to facilitate the reallocation of resources to their most productive uses and to foster labour productivity growth and technological progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The implementation of structural reforms is envisaged under a wide-ranging programme for economic, social and environmental reform in the EU, a programme known as the Lisbon strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">In particular, Member States are required to reduce tax burdens on low-wage earners, to bring wage developments into line with productivity, to raise the skill level of the workforce as well as to adopt active ageing strategies to encourage older workers to stay in the workforce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This strategy should increase the flexibility of, and lower the adjustment costs for, European firms and workers confronted with globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Improving competitiveness is the main condition for making globalisation a success for the citizens of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.12,0)">As for fiscal policies, in the global economy, capital and labour mobility puts pressure on tax bases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Rather than a “race to the bottom”, with only tax rates reduced, we begin to see tax reforms that make a country more “competitive” and more attractive for investment and human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">On the expenditure side, the influence of globalisation appears to be more limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">We should expect a tendency towards smaller but more efficient budgets, with “higher-quality” public spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This implies, for example, more emphasis on “tomorrow” – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">investment and education   – and less on “yesterday” – e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.83,0)">less money spent on unemployment benefit for unskilled workers or on large and inefficient public administrations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">On this issue, the debate has only started in the European Council of Ministers of the EU Member States  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">In this respect, a number of important moves towards structural reforms are also currently under discussion in the ECOFIN to make the public sector more efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Finally, in a globalised world, the soundness of public finances becomes ever more important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The links between financial markets are growing closer and all governments must ensure the sustainability of their fiscal positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In this context, the ECB calls upon the Member States of the EU to comply fully with the Stability and Growth Pact, an agreement which aims to ensure that they conduct prudent fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.84,0)">Globalisation changes the environment also for monetary policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.57,0)">As I mentioned earlier, globalisation intensifies global competition – for example by reducing the pricing power of firms – and necessitates adjustments to relative prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.44,0)">In the presence of nominal rigidities, changes in relative prices and the pricing power of firms can affect inflation in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.35,0)">But even in the long run, when all adjustment processes have come to an end, globalisation is likely to affect the transmission of economic shocks to inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me give you an example to illustrate the effects of globalisation on the transmission of shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.32,0)">I will consider the case of a shock to production costs, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.26,0)">due to high wage pressures in one country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.48,0)">Increased competition implies reduced pricing power of firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.44,0)">In response to increases in costs, competitive forces may prevent individual firms from adjusting prices by as much as in a low-competition environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.5,0)">As a consequence, shocks to production costs might have a smaller effect on domestic inflation than what we are seeing today but a larger effect on output and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">In Europe, this implies a very important message to the social partners, notably trade unions and employers’ organisations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.54,0)">Excessive wage agreements in a highly competitive environment have much higher costs in terms of growth and employment than they had in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Social partners in Europe seem to have understood this, as inflationary pressure coming from labour costs has been much lower in recent years than in previous decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This, in turn, has led to significant employment gains in Europe, now amounting to 14.9 million new jobs created since the euro was introduced, compared with only 3 million jobs in the 8½ years before its launch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This gives us hope that the structural reforms which have been implemented in recent years have helped to create jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">But we cannot simply assume that these trends will continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Therefore, the pursuit of price stability will remain a demanding task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Central banks will need to carefully monitor the changes to the structure of the economy and to the behaviour of economic agents brought about by globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.23,0)">How should monetary policy respond to the effects of globalisation on inflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I would like to stress that globalisation does not affect the central role, the capability and overriding responsibility of central banks to preserve price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the long run, when adjustment processes are over, globalisation will affect real quantities only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">After all, whatever the influences being exerted in the context of globalisation, the basic tenet of monetary policy remains: in the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.11,0)">Globalisation can at times mean fairly rapid changes in relative prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">In such an environment, I would argue that a credible commitment to maintaining price stability is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Most importantly, such a commitment helps consumers and firms to accept changes in relative prices while the aggregate price level is largely unaffected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.09,0)">Central banks should not prevent efficient changes in relative prices triggered by a move towards a new equilibrium due to globalisation, but they are well advised to prevent significant second-round effects from spreading to other parts of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">Economic integration within Europe has gone hand in hand with Europe’s integration into the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">These forces call for structural adjustment in order to fully grasp the opportunities they provide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">To this end, we should make our markets even more flexible and promote
