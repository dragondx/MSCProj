    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.56,0)"> Lecture on “Activism and alertness in monetary policy” by Jean-Claude TrichetPresident of the European Central Bankat the conference on Central Banks in the 21st Century organised by the Banco de Espana, Madrid, 8 June 2006 Ladies and gentlemen, Since 1 January 1999, the day on which it officially became the monetary authority of the euro area, the ECB has changed its policy rate, the rate on its main refinancing operations, 18 times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Over the same period, the Federal Reserve System has made 35 changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.23,0)">The easing cycle that started on both sides of the Atlantic – and of the Channel – in 2001 saw a cumulative reduction in the policy rate of 275 basis points in the euro area, accomplished in a sequence of seven moves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The ECB started to reverse that cycle in December last year and has since changed its policy in a sequence of three steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.72,0)">In the United States, the same easing phase saw 13 reductions, with a total loosening of 550 basis points, and was first reversed in June 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Since then, the Federal Reserve has hiked its target rate 16 times in continuous steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">I thought I would take advantage of the opportunity afforded by this impressive programme to revisit a theme on which I have reflected in the past: “activism” in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.09,0)">Is there a univocal definition of this notion?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Can “activism” be quantified by simple statistics such as the frequency and size of policy moves?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Can a central bank be “active” while moving its policy rate in a measured and observationally cautious way?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Was the ECB active enough in responding to the evolving state of the euro area economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.2,0)">The few facts that I have recounted seem to suggest otherwise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I will try to convince you that the contrary is true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I will offer some provisional answers on the basis of what I believe I have learned thus far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">I suspect, though, that the passing of time and further analysis of the euro area economy will be needed to deepen our understanding of this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">My definition of activism in monetary policy is, I believe, conventional: activism is the strategic attitude of a central bank that is constantly endeavouring to be faithful to its objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">In the case of the ECB, it is the constant striving to keep inflation close to its arithmetic objective, and to take all the steps needed to check nascent inflationary pressures while at the same time trying to minimise unnecessary macroeconomic disruptions in the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">“Activist” is an attribute that applies to a strategy, not to a policy path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.05,0)">My answer to the question of whether or not activism can be measured by simple statistics is negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Strategic activism in monetary policy cannot be quantified in simple terms, not in abstraction from knowledge of the key structural forces and economic relationships that govern the functioning of our systems at any point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.95,0)">When evaluating the appropriateness of their action, central banks do not have the luxury of linking policy to a handful of summary statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.36,0)">They engage in a complicated process of signal extraction from a wealth of diffuse data and events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.38,0)">They calibrate decisions to the key structural parameters of the economy in which monetary policy has to function, to the nature of the shocks to which the economy is typically prone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The path of policy is adjusted accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">The ECB’s strategy is as active as it needs to be to fulfil our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">I would claim that clarity about the objective of our policy afforded considerable latitude for action in the early years of the decade, and a remarkable leverage over market conditions more recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.45,0)">This has happened despite repeated unfavourable shocks in the former period and apparent policy inaction in the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Always, our strategy and the information coming from the real economy, as well as from the sphere of monetary aggregates, much more than our words, have shaped market expectations beyond the very near term, a sign that the complex analysis required to predict our judgement has not materially impeded market participants in responding meaningfully to incoming data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.79,0)">Policy activism and economic dynamism To frame the issue, let us consider a stereotypical monetary policy reaction function that has a short-term interest rate on the left and a number of observable reaction variables on the right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.39,0)">Think, for example, of any kind of reaction functions that econometricians and expert observers often use – and sometimes abuse – to compare monetary policy strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In essence, they all encapsulate a simple rule of thumb: raise the policy rate if anticipated inflation is higher than the objective and there are signs that the economy is operating above capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.16,0)">An additional condition for ensuring macroeconomic stability that applies to these rules is that the reaction in the nominal rate must be strong enough for the real rate to be varied pro-cyclically: when inflation expectations rise, and the economy expands above potential, real monetary conditions have to be tightened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I choose this way of framing the issue primarily because it is widely used by our observers, and because it is sufficiently concise to be easily understood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.75,0)">But, before launching into the analysis, I should add that, precisely because it is simple and pedagogical, this framework is also a very incomplete description of our policy behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Overall, because it does not capture the very essence of the two-pillar strategy, based on an economic assessment of medium-term risks to price stability, on the one hand, and a cross-checking based on medium to longer-term risks assessed though our monetary analysis, on the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Also, because such representations of our policy are not sufficiently state-contingent, whereas my colleagues and I are far from being exclusively guided by mechanical configurations of indicators, but are very interested in the contingencies, and finally take our decisions on the basis of synthetic judgement enlightened by multiple experiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As I often say, collegial wisdom is of the essence in central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.08,0)">This underscores the tension between describing policy simply and implementing policy simply: simple descriptions of policy need not – and indeed never do – mean simple policy behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Assuming that the parameters attached to the various indicator variables in the reaction function indeed capture the deep strategic preferences of the central bank, empirical estimates of these coefficients are often used to quantify the strength with which the central bank intends to respond to the state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In other words, these estimated parameters are sometimes viewed as objective measures of strategic “activism” in monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.05,0)">A central bank would qualify as strategically more passive – or less active – than another central bank if the estimated coefficient attached to inflation expectations in deviation from the central bank’s objective, and the estimated coefficient penalising the indicator of macroeconomic slack, turned out to be smaller.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.51,0)">Why would this central bank qualify as more “passive”?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Because, for given variances of inflation and real activity, this central bank would indeed be inclined to take more moderate action in response to changes in the outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.59,0)">It would move its policy rate by narrower margins – and perhaps more infrequently – than its more “activist” counterpart.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Moreover, as analysts typically append a partial adjustment mechanism to the representation of how the central bank interest rate responds to the economic state, there is an additional source of “activism” – or “passivity” – that would emerge from these simple empirics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.32,0)">This is the inertia coefficient attached to the lagged interest rate dependent variable, which in these rules moderates the pace of reaction of the policy rate to its fundamental determinants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.33,0)">In any case, in the naive theory of this world, plain comparison of the frequencies of policy moves and the size of interest rate adjustments would suffice to tell the strategies of these two central banks apart.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">A smoother policy path would signal a “more passive” strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.06,0)">But of course the world is not that simple, and in fact there are serious pitfalls lurking behind strategic inferences drawn on the basis of comparisons of variances in policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.72,0)">It is not too difficult to portray situations in which such inferences could be highly misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I will give three examples, all relaxing one important qualification upon which my earlier example was predicated: the assumption that our two central banks are confronted with the same economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">First, imagine two central banks which are equally responsive to economic conditions: in the reaction-rule jargon that I am using here, these are two central banks that share exactly the same reaction parameters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.98,0)">But one central bank now faces a less dynamic economy than its counterpart.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.42,0)">By “less dynamic” I mean an economy that – as a matter of regularity – is hit by shocks of smaller magnitude which tend to fade away more gradually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.83,0)">Here, reaction parameters are the same – by hypothesis – but the reaction variables fluctuate at different speeds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">All other things being equal, the patterns of adjustment of the policy rate that the same rule would induce in the two economies would be likely to look very different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The central bank operating in the less dynamic economy would in all likelihood be observed to adjust interest rates along a more moderate path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.71,0)">The other central bank would appear more reactive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.78,0)">But any strategic implications drawn from the variance in the two policy paths would be purely illusionary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The smoother course of policy would not reveal any deep-seated strategic inertia: it would only reflect the same response to shocks with quite different dynamic properties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.34,0)">Monetary policy would appear “passive” because the economy itself was evolving slowly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.96,0)">A second example again considers two identical central banks, now facing shocks of a different nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.7,0)">One central bank predominantly faces demand shocks, which result in persistent departures from trend growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This statistical pattern has symmetric and durable effects on output and inflation and thus presents a relatively straightforward monetary policy problem under the rule that I am postulating here for simplicity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.18,0)">As both reaction variables – forecasted inflation and output – would frequently move in tandem, the policy rate of this central bank would have to be changed frequently and forcefully in the same direction to offset the shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.92,0)">But what would happen in the other economy, if it – unlike the first – were more prone to supply shocks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.23,0)">Experience suggests that supply shocks yield sharp transitory increases in inflation, possibly followed by smaller, more permanent “second-round” effects, though the longer-run impact on inflation is obviously significantly determined by the response of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Given the transitory nature of the initial inflation bursts, the simple hypothetical rule – which incorporates the reaction to expected inflation – would advise the central bank to “look through” the immediate disturbance and change policy only to the extent needed to offset the anticipated more permanent effects of the shock on inflation in subsequent quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Its policy rate, again, would be observed to be less variable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">What is important to note is that the same rule – equally active strategies – would support two different patterns of observed policy behaviour in different economic environments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The third case is perhaps the most interesting of all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.74,0)">Here exogenous shocks are identical, but economic structures differ.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.38,0)">Different transmission mechanisms therefore propagate the same shocks with lags that vary between the two economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.43,0)">The first economy has more rigid adjustment mechanisms: price-setters and wage-negotiators are more sluggish than those in the other economy in processing economic news – including changes in the stance of monetary policy – and bringing them to bear on their decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.69,0)">What is the source of those rigidities in the first economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.21,0)">There can be many reasons for rigidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.82,0)">Perhaps labour practices and contractual institutions – dating from the early post-war decades when the economy was heavily regulated – induce distortions in large segments of the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">This stands in the way of an efficient matching of skills and productive capabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.67,0)">Perhaps tight regulatory restraint on business and statutory inhibitions discourage innovation and impede a faster response to new shocks and new opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Whatever the source of rigidity, the observational result is that prices and wages in the first economy reflect changes in fundamentals with considerable lags.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.25,0)">How should monetary policy respond to shocks in these conditions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The answer to my question depends critically on the inflation process that we postulate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We know that when inflation expectations are well-anchored around the inflation objective of the central bank, the evolution of inflation over time is influenced by the numerical objective of policy more than by the history of inflation itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.35,0)">We can state this differently, saying that when the economy internalises the central bank’s objective firmly, the inflation process becomes less persistent and more forward-looking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.34,0)">If inflation expectations are well-anchored, a shock to inflation in the recent past is likely to have a lesser impact on inflation in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.22,0)">One reason for this is that the shock will not encourage workers to bargain for commensurate rises in nominal wages to protect the real value of earnings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Equally, firms would certainly resist such potential bargaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.96,0)">All such parties and other price-setters will anticipate that the central bank will ultimately drive inflation back to its pre-shock level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.49,0)">Hence, they will tend to treat past inflationary shocks as transitory and inconsequential for the future outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In the first economy in this example, where prices are sticky and inflation expectations are well-anchored, monetary policy can be more patient and focused on the medium term when confronting a cost-push shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.21,0)">Again, as in the other two examples, it is likely to be observed to change policy less aggressively in the face of an unexpected shock to headline inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.95,0)">But this seeming “patience”, once again, does not signal inertia, “passivity” or neglect for macroeconomic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It reflects a careful calibration of the policy course to the structural peculiarities of the underlying economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">First and foremost, the policy response to the inflationary shock will be less persistent because the inflationary consequences of the shock will be more promptly reabsorbed in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Second, with stickier prices, a change in the nominal policy rate of a given size will have a stronger impact on the real rate, which is all that matters when it comes to measuring the stance of policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In these conditions, a more moderate policy path is not a cause of instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.94,0)">In fact, it is the very precondition for avoiding the dangers of over-steering, of accidentally destabilising the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.87,0)">Of course, the thought experiments that I have been sharing with you so far are only as useful as the rules or the optimality benchmarks with which real-world behaviour has been compared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.83,0)">And I am certainly not the only one here who believes that simple reaction rules – or monetary policy optimality exercises, for that matter – cannot serve as the ultimate test for actual policy behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But I hope I have conveyed one notion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.33,0)">Even in the over-simplified world of my canonical examples, where the macroeconomic state can be adequately described by a handful of facts, where these facts are reliably condensed in summary indicators – which, too, are immune from sampling errors and statistical revisions  – and where policy algorithms are an acceptable description of policy choices, even in that conjectural world the variability of the policy instrument would not be a sufficient statistic with which to judge monetary policy strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In particular, even in that world, a slower-moving, structurally more rigid economy would support an observationally more moderate policy course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In the real world, as I will try to explain next, that observationally moderate path for policy receives an even stronger justification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Facts and policy in the euro area My emphasis on a structurally more rigid and less dynamic economy periodically facing adverse supply shocks is, of course, deliberate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">That laboratory case resembles the euro area that I know.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I will organise my interpretation of stylised facts about the euro area in the recent past into three broad categories: shocks, structures and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.98,0)">Shocks One reason the euro area resembles my third example is that, compared with the United States, it seems to be subject to demand shocks of smaller magnitude but to be more frequently hit by supply shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">In the last ten years this shock pattern seems to have grown even more pronounced, despite globalisation and a generalised shift towards closer international economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is nowhere more evident than in the anatomy of the boom-bust cycle that spanned the decade starting in 1995 in the two economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.3,0)">In the United States, the run-up phase was significantly propelled – as we know with hindsight – by overly optimistic views about long-run earnings growth and, notably, exaggerated beliefs in the profitability of emerging technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">But the strength in business investment that the boom brought with it also had important implications for the supply side of the US economy, through its influence on the rate of increase in labour productivity and thus the economy’s sustainable level of potential output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">ECB staff calculations estimate that the contribution to the growth of output per hour worked coming from capital deepening doubled in the United States in the course of the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Subsequently – and despite the sharp reappraisal of those expectations and the unprecedented drop in business investment that followed the market collapse in 2000 – it stabilised at the elevated levels that it had reached at the turn of the millennium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Since then, remarkably, capital deepening has been replaced, as the main engine of output per hour growth, by extraordinary advancements in total factor productivity  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Arguably, US firms have been able to meet expanding demand with a more efficient organisation of the production processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.7,0)">The same ten-year episode had a distinctly different face in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.9,0)">The stock market appreciation – comparable in size to that seen in the United States – went hand in hand with a decline, not a rise, in the contribution of capital to measured productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.36,0)">And a contemporaneous steady decline in TFP throughout the decade has reinforced, rather than offset, the diminishing contribution of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The euro area seems to have had its fair share of stock market turbulence, without enjoying the side benefit of improved supply conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.5,0)">The slowdown in trend productivity has been a primary determinant of the weak economic performance of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.83,0)">By depressing income growth prospects and by reducing the prospective return on capital, it has held back consumption spending and business investment, which has been further curtailed to some extent by the ongoing demographic shift towards a more elderly population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.5,0)">Rapidly decelerating productivity was one force behind the counter-cyclical rebound in unit labour costs that we observed during the early part of the new millennium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.18,0)">This surge in unit labour costs was atypical, if contrasted with the way in which unit labour costs in the United States elastically responded to the downturn with a sharp decline, and it represented an ongoing source of inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.34,0)">Adverse underlying developments in productivity have made it more difficult for our firms to smooth through the volatility of the many non-wage cost disturbances that they have encountered since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.85,0)">This lesser degree of resilience has kept the evolution of inflation – and real activity as well – constantly vulnerable to unexpected shocks, such as the increases in the prices of energy and beef – to name only two – which have been brought about by adverse changes in supply conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Again, compare these developments with the sharp disinflation which occurred, during the same period, in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Of course, we cannot directly observe full capacity of either labour or other production factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Consequently, we can never be certain about the level of activity that would represent the full utilisation of available resources, and even less so about the strength of the relationship that links utilisation and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.56,0)">However, I hope that I have demonstrated that this connection is seemingly weak in the euro area, probably weaker than across the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Structures This structural feature brings me to the second category of my remarks: the structure of the economy on this side of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I will concentrate on two factors that critically affect the relationship between inflation and the fundamental shocks that drive the economy and determine its state: price flexibility and the anchoring of price-setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Extensive empirical research on price flexibility and inflation persistence in the euro area has recently been produced in a concerted effort that has occupied staff of the ECB and of the entire European System of Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.06,0)">It comes to two main conclusions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">First, in the euro area, prices are distinctly less flexible than, say, in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.52,0)">Prices change infrequently: the average duration of a consumer price spell – a measure of the time that it takes for retailers to reprice their products – is 13 months  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.05,0)">According to surveys, it is 11 months for producers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.3,0)">In the United States, comparable figures indicate durations of less than 7 months and slightly more than 8 months respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.26,0)">Table 1: Measures of price stickiness for the euro area and the United States Sources: For the CPI in the euro area, Dhyne et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">, Bils and Klenow   in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">For the PPI, Vermeulen et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Surveys: Fabiani et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">for the euro area, Blinder et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">for the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.07,0)">New Keynesian Phillips Curve: Estimates in Galí et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.45,0)">refer to the GDP deflator and are converted from original quarterly figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.83,0)">More infrequent price revisions make the setting of prices less responsive to economic news, including, as I already pointed out, changes in monetary conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">In general, sticky price revision processes reduce the odds that the imbalances created by economic shocks can be rectified by adjustments in prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.37,0)">Conversely, they make the burden of adjustment to a shock fall disproportionately on changes in output, incomes and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.86,0)">Also, stickier prices tend – all other things being equal – to increase the persistence of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.36,0)">This is because the impact of a shock that today modifies firms’ real cost conditions tends to be spread out over an extended future, as staggered price adjustments catch up only slowly with the changed underlying circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.65,0)">Despite sluggish price-setting mechanisms, however, inflation persistence in the euro area is low by international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">This is the second important finding of the new body of evidence that I mentioned: an inflationary shock dissipates quickly in the euro area despite rigidities, and inflation has a tendency to return to its long-run norm reasonably quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The half-life of the effect of a shock to inflation is considerably less than one year, which is close to the figure that one obtains, for example, for the United States, again notwithstanding vastly different patterns of price-updating practices across the two areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.96,0)">What explains this apparently inconsistent evidence?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Another ECB study, estimating a structural model on euro area and US data, goes some way towards reconciling empirical stickiness in prices and low persistence in inflation on the basis of a model of inflation determination that features real costs and expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.19,0)">As I said before, even if price sluggishness introduces persistence into the inflation process – which in itself tends to perpetuate past inflation pressures into the future – some of that persistence can be undone if the expectations of price and wage-setters are focused on the objective of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Indeed, this study finds that the influence of the ECB’s inflation objective on the evolution over time of inflation outweighs the influence of past shocks, and thus at least partly compensates for the added inertia resulting from a more rigid economic structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">We are pleased to observe that analysis of survey-based measures of inflation expectations suggests that central bank leverage on expectations has become much stronger since the establishment of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Monetary policy Having reviewed structures and shocks, I now move on to the third aspect of my discussion of the euro area: monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Did considerations pertaining to the nature of the shocks that occurred in the recent past and to the structural peculiarities of the euro area play any role in positioning the stance of monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Can they go some way towards explaining the observationally moderate path that the policy rate has followed in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.91,0)">Did the smoother path of our policy rate impede a smooth adjustment of the euro area to the shocks that have hit the global economy in the recent past?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.07,0)">Finally, does low inflation persistence provide reason for complacency?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.35,0)">When the ECB in early 2001 initiated the easing cycle that we started to reverse in December last year, this was done on the heels of significant adverse supply shocks, relatively strong wage dynamics, and headline inflation rates at levels unseen in Europe since the late phases of convergence to the new currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Yet the Governing Council judged that our commitment to attaining price stability, in line with our official definition, through our monetary policy strategy was sufficiently credible for us to take that easing decision without running the risk of destabilising inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">That conviction was reinforced by a rapidly deteriorating outlook and by reassuring signs that inflation expectations discounted a scenario in which inflation would settle in the zone of price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The rapid softening of activity that we saw coming and the increasing odds that the recovery would not materialise soon – we believed – would validate ex post the inflation expectations and make the threat of renewed inflation considerably weaker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Information extracted from monetary trends supported our prediction of subdued inflation looking into the more distant future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Monetary accommodation was quicker and, in retrospect, far more persistent than could have been predicted on the basis of the policy regularities on record.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">In the end, monetary action amounted to an interest rate reduction of 275 basis points, bringing the policy rate to a level which was below the lowest intervention rate of the central banks of an overwhelming majority of member countries, including Germany, during the last 50 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">It is all the more remarkable that we were able to follow such a historically unseen trajectory for our vast continental economy, the euro area, given that the individual countries had very diverse and mixed legacies as regards past monetary credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.08,0)">It is difficult to work out a convincing counterfactual: what would have happened if the reaction of the ECB had been more in line with the patterns of policy behaviour established in the past, rather than the more forceful action we took.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">However, structural – if model-specific – analysis of the mix of the macroeconomic shocks that have hit the euro area since 2001 reveals with hindsight that the extra monetary policy stimulus that we introduced has been critical in avoiding a deeper and more enduring recession here and on a global scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I judge that the policy course was carefully calibrated to the structural characteristics of the euro area transmission mechanism, some features of which I tried to outline earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">We were guided, in particular, by the understanding that a central bank operating in a relatively rigid economy is able to deliver the same quantum of monetary accommodation by adjusting its policy instrument in more moderate steps than in a relatively more flexible economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.59,0)">Under the structural conditions that prevail in our economy, a more aggressive easing would have introduced unwelcome volatility in both inflation and output that would have necessitated corrective, countervailing action further down the road.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.81,0)">Certainly, as I will argue shortly, the ECB would not have maintained the nominal and real policy rate at the low levels at which they were held for more than two years without consistent signs that expectations were well-anchored and inflationary shocks were being quickly reabsorbed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Alertness and active communication No central bank represented in this room, or elsewhere, can reasonably spell out in advance its reaction to every conceivable contingency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This means that surprises in our behaviour can never be ruled out, notably in the face of potent shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.46,0)">In particular, we might be confronted with new occurrences of risks which could force us to take bold steps that our observers could not have predicted by extrapolating from our past history of policy conduct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">To some extent, this is what occurred over the earlier phase of the international economic downturn: we took sizeable risks in the direction of “activism”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.29,0)">What were those risks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.25,0)">First, in an economy as rigid as the euro area, it might well be true that temporary imbalances between demand and potential supply are slow to show through convincingly to inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.17,0)">But if and when they finally do, they would be more costly to correct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">So, monetary policy should be sufficiently alert to any threats to the outlook for price stability, so that it does not find itself reacting belatedly – and with less chance of success – to trends that have long been underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Second, it is true that the expectation that inflation will not come loose from its anchor affords some short-term flexibility to respond to economic disturbances – with a view to ensuring more balanced macroeconomic conditions in the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">But that flexibility only lasts as long as economic agents and the public are confident that the opportunity will not be misused.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.08,0)">And we just do not know enough about the way policy actions influence expectations and how sensitive central banks’ credibility is to short-run departures from low inflation to warrant experimenting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.29,0)">Occasional monetary policy activism, as circumstances require, is not the same as fine-tuning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Fine-tuning – if I may twist a phrase borrowed from Alan Blinder and Ricardo Reis – cannot be resurrected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Building and maintaining a reputation for prudent policy involves commitment to a systematic strategy: that is, following a recurrent pattern of behaviour, so that stable expectations are consistently validated ex post.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">During the extended period of policy accommodation, we were able to steer expectations effectively without explicit action, proof that markets accept as true the ultimate motives of policy that we profess.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In those instances in which expectations displayed signs of overreaction to current events – such as surging oil prices – our renewed emphasis in communication on our objective, on the vigilance and determination that we would apply to enforce it, on our steady alertness, provided effective resistance to inordinate developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Importantly, signalling vigilance proved instrumental in reaching a common understanding with the markets: the ECB, though observationally inactive, was at any time ready to start action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Our policy course was rightly seen as always contingent on the arrival of new information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Given the information available each time the Governing Council meets, the standing assumption in the markets should always be that the policy decision is aimed at positioning the stance of policy appropriately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">No history of past monetary policy decisions could ever be taken as an indication of a commitment, on our side, to enact a sequence of interest rate moves in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.53,0)">Unconditional – or “quasi-unconditional” – talk about future policy would have impaired the difficult balance that we maintained between supportive credit conditions and persistently anchored inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Active emphasis in communication upon “alertness” required keeping all options open to a – possibly quick – change in policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.7,0)">Pre-commitment to a policy path would certainly have made that reversal of policy difficult to execute and/or to justify, and therefore non-credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The markets seem to have internalised these strategic principles with an increasing degree of precision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Incoming data which, since the autumn of 2005, have indicated more persuasive signs of a recovery in an environment of abundant liquidity and elevated commodity prices were correctly mapped into expectations that the stance then prevailing would not be consistent with controlling inflation over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Markets anticipated in good time that the ECB would soon begin reversing the extra easing that had been put in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In retrospect, market expectations have aligned well with our intentions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Since December, consistent with our remit to be alert and pre-emptive, the monetary policy of the ECB has been perceived to be in a mode of progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Indeed, this withdrawal has been and remains conditional on the evolution of our analysis with respect to our objective of price stability, but it has not been predicated on any single short-term indicator of the macroeconomic state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.24,0)">In the last few months, the ECB has not measured the state of the economy by the strength or weakness of any particular piece of incoming news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">It has continued to extract the macroeconomic trend from the wealth of cumulative evidence accruing – from month to month – from the economic and the monetary side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In both cases, the medium-term orientation of its monitoring activity has been preserved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Two examples: as regards our economic analysis, when looking at the underlying trend of growth of the European economy, we judged in the second half of last year that we were experiencing a recovery with the trend progressively approaching potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">We judged that the short-term volatility observed in important indicators, including the quarterly growth figure for the fourth quarter of 2005, did not call into question the medium-term growth prospects and therefore the associated gradual increase of risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Another example can be extracted from our monetary analysis: consistent indications that broad money growth was increasingly due to its most liquid components has contributed in recent months to a gradual tilt of the balance of risks perceived to be signalled by our monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.68,0)">It was not the behaviour of aggregate M3 per se which altered the outlook for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.6,0)">It was the realisation that the structural force at work behind persistently abundant liquidity was becoming increasingly connected with final spending and pricing decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.36,0)">As I said at the start, the complexity of the analysis required to predict our moves has not materially impeded market participants in responding meaningfully to incoming data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">The understanding of our strategy and the information coming from the real economy, as well as from the sphere of monetary aggregates, have shaped market expectations beyond the very near term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">I attribute this satisfactory result to our policy framework, which features a primary, sharply-defined objective and a systematic reaction to events whenever the objective is perceived to be at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Concluding remarks I am sometimes asked the following question: “You are in the process of increasing rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.13,0)">Is your judgement that your rates today are significantly lower than they should be?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.03,0)">What then is the level of the “neutral rate” that you would judge it appropriate to reach  ?” My response to such questions would be the following.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">First, we are not in a position that we would judge “abnormal”, in the sense that we would have to increase as rapidly as possible our interest rates up to the “normal” level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We are in a process of progressively withdrawing the present degree of monetary accommodation commensurate with the risks to price stability that we perceive, associated in particular with the present development of the economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">To the extent that we never previously pre-committed to unconditional moves and we have always adhered to the posture of steady alertness which is at the heart of our strategy, our monetary policy stance should and does – to the best of our own comprehensive, deep and candid assessment of the situation – at any time makes it possible to cope with the risks we see for price stability in a medium-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Then, in a dynamic perspective, our refusal of unconditional pre-commitments, our position of permanent, steady alertness and our strategy help focus our policy upon being permanently at the “correct level” in terms of attaining our primary goal in a medium-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Second, from a central bank’s perspective, the Wicksellian concept of a “neutral rate” is more particularly useful in the event that the central bank has – for whatever reason – moved its rates far away from the policy stance that it would judge appropriate ici et maintenant, here and now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.02,0)">As you can see, in my view, this cannot be the case for the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Third, one can be sure that we will continue to analyse the situation very carefully on an ongoing basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">It is clear that if our main scenario is confirmed over time, a further withdrawal of monetary accommodation will be appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We do not specify ex ante a sequence of policy actions, as I have said clearly since last December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The appropriate policy stance will always depend on information on the economic and monetary side and on the source and dynamic properties of the underlying shocks that will hit the economy and we will always remain alert.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It is the combination of events and data, some expected, others unexpected, that will be analysed and will permit us to define our future trajectory.</span>
