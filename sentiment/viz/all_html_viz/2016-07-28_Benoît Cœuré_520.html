    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.93,0)"> Assessing the implications of negative interest rates Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Yale Financial Crisis Forum, Yale School of Management, New Haven, 28 July 2016 Introduction  Interest rates have been low across all major advanced economies for some time now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.65,0)">The decline in interest rates – both nominal and real – has been a persistent trend since the 1990s and is visible in the long-term interest rates on government bonds  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.54,0)">A range of structural factors have been proposed for this secular decline in the rate of return on safe assets, including demographic changes, a slowdown in the rate of technological progress, and a high demand for safe assets relative to their supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.12,0)">This decline in long-run interest rates has consequences for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.05,0)">Monetary policymakers often think in terms of a concept known as the real equilibrium rate or the “natural” rate of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This equilibrium rate is the interest rate that is consistent with stable inflation and output at its potential level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.53,0)">Setting short-term interest rates above this rate puts downward pressure on activity and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.49,0)">Setting them below this rate of course has the opposite effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.06,0)">While this real equilibrium interest rate is difficult to estimate precisely, and while there are competing explanations for it, there is a broad consensus that it has declined in advanced economies over the past two decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.37,0)">By some estimates it is currently negative in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.6,0)">Since the global financial crisis, inflation has been low worldwide, and growth subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Central bankers are responding to this low inflation and output below potential by conducting accommodative policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.88,0)">Both these cyclical factors and the longer-term decline in the equilibrium real rate of interest have required policy rates to be set at record low levels in advanced economies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">As short-term policy rates approached zero, central banks carried out further loosening by providing forward guidance about the expected future path of interest rates and by lowering term premia through large-scale asset purchase programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.61,0)">In June 2014, following in the footsteps of the Danish National Bank, the European Central Bank   became the first major central bank to lower one of its key policy rates to negative territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.68,0)">The rate of interest on our deposit facility is now -0.4% while the rate on our main refinancing operations is zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">At the same time, we launched an asset purchase programme   covering a broad range of investment grade securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">These various policy measures are complementary instruments and are necessary to ensure that sufficient stimulus is provided to the economy to return inflation to the ECB’s objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.95,0)">Failure to take into account the downward trend in real equilibrium interest rates would have resulted in downward pressure on inflation and activity, pushing real interest rates up and driving the economy further away from full employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.37,0)">It is difficult to know how long these low interest rates will persist, but it seems possible that they will be low for quite some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.57,0)">That certainly is the view of financial markets, where the return on government bonds is negative for a range of countries, even at long maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.53,0)">While low or negative rates and the asset purchase programmes are needed to provide sufficient monetary stimulus, a number of observers have voiced concern about their impact on the behaviour of economic agents, on the resilience of financial intermediaries and, ultimately, on financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Today, I will offer some thoughts on these issues, focusing on the banking sector, which plays a key role in the transmission of monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.96,0)">The specialness of negative nominal interest rates So what makes negative rates special?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The first answer is cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.63,0)">Since cash   offers a zero nominal return, at some point it will dominate holding assets with negative nominal yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.19,0)">For example, if banks were to charge significantly negative rates on deposits, then the higher return on cash could lead households and businesses to withdraw their deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.5,0)">And this disintermediation would be likely to pose risks to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Of course, holding cash is not entirely convenient or costless.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.72,0)">It would be cumbersome   to buy a car or a house in cash, and storing a large amount of cash requires high-security storage as well as insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.75,0)">These costs of holding and insuring cash explain why the effective lower bound on interest rates is below zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.51,0)">The academic discussion of negative rates has centred around cash, but in public debate other issues have recently emerged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.21,0)">One issue is associated with money illusion, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.94,0)">the tendency of people to value assets and goods in nominal rather than in real terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.55,0)">This led to the notion that negative nominal rates are unnatural, which has become a popular theme in the public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.19,0)">In contrast, we have been through episodes of negative real rates in the past without having such debates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.69,0)">Indeed, as the Bundesbank has noted, negative real rates of interest on deposits have been the norm rather than the exception in Germany in recent decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">People may gradually understand the rationale behind negative nominal rates and adapt to this new situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.1,0)">For instance, the popular assumption that the negative income effect on household consumption dominates the positive substitution effect when nominal yields are very low is not in line with the evidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.8,0)">In fact, the average net interest income of euro area households has been largely unaffected, thanks to lower interest payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.89,0)">Low interest rates have mainly redistributed resources from net savers to net borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">As the latter typically have a higher marginal propensity to consume than the former, this has further supported consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.51,0)">But one cannot rule out that negative nominal interest rates raise broader cognitive issues as they challenge the rules of thumb used by economic agents in their everyday decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.5,0)">Finally, negative rates may be special due to institutional features embedded in the financial system, such as legal restrictions on the application of negative rates or at least uncertainty regarding the legal standing of such an arrangement,  or the tax treatment of negative interest rate income, which is often not symmetric with the treatment of positive interest rate income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.18,0)">In addition, some IT systems may not be able to cope with negative rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In the euro area, however, these scenarios have not yet materialised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Thanks to intensive technical cooperation between the ECB and market participants ahead of the introduction of negative rates, our experience has been very smooth, allowing large parts of the government bond and secured and unsecured money markets to operate at negative rates without any disruption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">The introduction of negative rates has been smooth also in other jurisdictions outside of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.31,0)">How low and for how long?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There are two key questions for central bankers  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.68,0)">First, how much lower can we go?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.27,0)">Second, does the persistence of low and/or negative interest rates pose particular challenges to the stability of the financial system?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Answering the first question appears to be simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.81,0)">As I said earlier, the “physical lower bound” of nominal interest rates, at which disintermediation risk will materialise, is imposed by the opportunity cost of holding cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.13,0)">But is there an “economic lower bound”, different from the physical one, where further rate cuts cease to provide aggregate stimulus to the economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.0,0)">This economic lower bound could then potentially but not necessarily impose an earlier binding constraint for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.81,0)">Indeed, in the current discussion, it has been suggested that at some point the level of rates can become low to the extent that the detrimental effects on the banking sector outweigh the benefits of lower rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In a recent paper, Brunnermeier and Koby refer to this rate as the “reversal rate”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.31,0)">At the reversal rate, bank profitability will fall, reducing capital generation via retained earnings, which is an important source of capital accumulation, and thereby eventually restricting lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.99,0)">The risk that low rates might cause short-term dislocation in financial markets was already identified by Bernanke and Reinhart in their 2004 paper on the implications of very low rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.24,0)">Low   have both a one-off short-term impact and more persistent effects on a bank’s profitability and capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.6,0)">And bank capital matters for credit provision and for financial stability, as low bank capital means high leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.33,0)">The short-term impact partly stems from one-off capital gains on the outstanding fixed-income portfolio of a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">When rates are falling, the value of fixed-income securities on a bank’s balance sheet goes up, leading to higher profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">A decline in the level of interest rates can also boost net interest margins in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.76,0)">Banks carry out maturity transformation by borrowing short term and lending long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.49,0)">As short-term interest rates fall, funds become cheaper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Since existing fixed-rate loans take some time to reprice to lower rates, the initial impact of lower rates on net interest margins could be positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.48,0)">Other things being equal, lower rates will decrease net interest income over the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.58,0)">If the decline in rates is accompanied by a flattening of the yield curve, the margin between lending and borrowing eventually compresses, reducing net interest income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.08,0)">Such a flattening may result from expectations of a prolonged period of low short-term rates, and it may be compounded by a compression of the term premium if the central bank also operates a large-scale asset purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.88,0)">Even for a given slope of the yield curve, a low level of interest rates can also compress net interest margins for banks reliant on retail deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.6,0)">The reason is that retail deposits tend to have low and sticky interest rates, and banks are reluctant to charge negative rates on them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.35,0)">As market rates decline, the yield on bank assets will eventually drop, but this funding source will still cost the same to banks, resulting in a decline in net interest margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.72,0)">The decline in present and future net interest margin reduces the forward-looking measure of bank capital, hence the risk-bearing capacity of the bank, and its supply of credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.83,0)">This is turning upside down Adrian and Shin’s “credit supply channel” of transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.57,0)">The exact magnitude of the effect of negative interest rates on aggregate bank profitability is uncertain, since it has to be put in the context of what would happen in the absence of monetary policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">First of all, servicing floating-rate loans and mortgages becomes more affordable as interest rates fall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.69,0)">Borrowers who are struggling in the adverse economic climate are therefore less likely to default.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Second, and more importantly, accommodative monetary policy should create a more favourable macroeconomic environment, which ought to improve the financial situation of bank borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.15,0)">Indeed, empirical research shows a clear negative relation between economic growth rates and non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">These positive effects are present at all rate levels and are likely to dominate when rates are moderately negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.23,0)">Also, the economic lower bound is not uniquely determined at the aggregate level, since it will vary across banks and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.75,0)">The larger the share of floating-rate lending in the stock of loans, the faster the negative impact on interest margins will be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Banks with large fixed-income holdings and holdings of bonds which benefited the most from spread compression will be better able to offset decreases in interest margins, due to the revaluation effect I mentioned earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The reversal rate is also likely to be lower for those banks that are more reliant on wholesale rather than retail funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Market-based funding suffers less from this zero lower bound, meaning that these banks will be better able to protect their interest margin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Similarly, banks with greater market power will be better able to avoid passing on the lower rates to borrowers, which will shield their interest margin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.92,0)">In the euro area, this translates into geographic differences based on national banking structures, implying that the negative interest rate policy has distributional consequences across banks located in different jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.41,0)">The second important question for central bankers is whether the persistence of low and/or negative interest rates poses other challenges to the stability of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Challenges to financial stability could potentially materialise if banks were to increase their exposure to lower quality counterparties in order to boost returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.47,0)">This could reflect a portfolio rebalancing towards riskier assets when yields on safe assets are low, or a greater concentration of lending to small and medium-sized enterprises  , which generate higher returns but have historically exhibited higher default risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.95,0)">The effect is similar to the “search for yield” by managers targeting a minimum return on assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.21,0)">Financial stability risks could also materialise outside of banks, through excessively inflated financial asset prices and if zero or negative rates encourage asset price volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.42,0)">Existing empirical evidence, mainly relying on periods with low, but positive rates before the global financial crisis, indicates that periods of lower interest rates are indeed associated with lower bank lending standards and with a shift of credit towards borrowers with a lower credit quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Additionally, the latest ECB Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises in the Euro Area   shows an improvement in the availability of bank loans for SMEs between October 2014   and March 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This could indicate that one way that banks are taking on more risk is by lending more to smaller, and typically riskier, firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Of course, promoting lending, including to risky borrowers, is one of the goals of accommodative monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.34,0)">But the main question, however, is whether negative rates can also lead to excessive risk-taking by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">If accommodative monetary policy works as intended, then more investment projects will gain a positive net present value and will be financed – including some riskier ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">That’s the “good” risk-taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.07,0)">However, banks may be tempted to finance risky but negative net present value loans – that is excessive or “bad” risk-taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The theory suggests that this possibility is more likely when interest rates are low, if banks are highly leveraged or if they can easily adjust their capital structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.31,0)">Empirical evidence While theoretically appealing, a precise estimate of the point where accommodative monetary policy becomes contractionary and/or an issue for financial stability is extremely challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">What I can offer you today is an overview of the situation of financial intermediaries in the euro area, in order to see whether there are signs that we have reached or are reaching a reversal rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But let me start by referring to the most recent data on monetary developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.95,0)">They show no signs of cash substitution, indicating that we are still far from the physical lower bound for nominal interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In a second step, let me focus on bank income and profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Slide 8 shows the main sources of operating income for banks in the euro area, based on aggregate numbers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In recent years, the distribution of these sources has been fairly stable, with approximately 60% of income coming from net interest income, 25% from fees and commissions and 15% from other income sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Given its large share, net interest income thus plays an important role in bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.46,0)">As I mentioned, a reduction in interest rates could harm interest margins, and this could be even more pronounced when rates enter negative territory, due to a potential zero lower bound for retail deposit rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.99,0)">Slide 9 illustrates average loan and deposit rates for both non-financial corporations and households in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.04,0)">The vertical red line indicates June 2014, the first time deposit facility rates became negative in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">The gap between loan rates and deposit rates narrows because declining rates are passed on more strongly to loan rates than to deposit rates, indicating that there indeed seems to be a zero lower bound for deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.66,0)">While average deposit rates only decreased by around 0.2 percentage point between June 2014 and May 2016, loan rates decreased by around 0.8 percentage point, effectively reducing the interest margin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.18,0)">This is also shown on slide 10, using profit and loss data of a group of large euro area banks, which on average indeed have seen a reduction of their net interest margins – defined here as net interest income over total assets – since mid-2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.47,0)">But what about overall income?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">ECB staff estimates show that the overall impact on bank profitability of recent monetary policy actions is net positive, compared with a scenario without any monetary policy action   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.62,0)">Decreasing net interest income and charges on excess liquidity do put pressure on bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">But there are also two strong positive effects of lower rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">First, the positive impact of lower rates on the macro environment reduces firm default risk and lowers the debt servicing cost of borrowers, which should improve credit quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Second, lower rates will lead to capital gains on the bond portfolio of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">The ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review  broadly confirms these model-based estimates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">As slide 12 shows, the net income of euro area significant banking groups actually increased between 2014 and 2015  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This was mainly driven by lower impairments and higher non-interest income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Even net interest income made a positive contribution, despite a small decline in interest margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">This reflects an increase in volumes, which is of course an intended consequence of accommodative monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.02,0)">As discussed earlier, however, interest margins are likely to stay low and might even further decline, while profits from one-off capital gains will fade away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.8,0)">Indeed, analysts forecast a decline in bank profitability in 2016 and 2017, mainly due to lower net interest income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.9,0)">And the recent decline in euro area bank share prices can be at least partially ascribed to market concerns over future banks profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.77,0)">As such, if very low or negative rates are here for a prolonged period of time due to the structural drivers highlighted above, banks might have to rethink their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The revenue structure of euro area banks was stable for a long time but it has recently begun to change and there is at least some evidence of banks tending to offer fee-based products to clients as substitutes for interest-based products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Another way forward is to improve cost efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.79,0)">Although a number of banks have reduced their operating costs over the last couple of years, overall cost efficiency has remained low in the euro area, with aggregate cost-income ratios between 63% and 65% over the last five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Action taken by euro-area banks to remedy this situation will also help them cope with a prolonged period of very low rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Action to dispose of their stocks of legacy non-performing loans, which has been identified by ECB Banking Supervision as one of its priorities for 2016, will also safeguard their profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.09,0)">Moving away from profitability, deposit growth rates for euro area banks show that there is no sign of disintermediation risk at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Deposits of both households and non-financial corporations have been growing over the past two years, at a similar pace to the period before we entered negative interest rate territory  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This risk is not materialising mainly because rates on retail deposit seem to have a zero lower bound, as shown earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.96,0)">With regard to bank lending, it is clear that we have not yet reached the reversal rate for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Bank lending has improved since mid-2014, both for non-financial corporations and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Similarly, results from the ECB’s July 2016 euro area bank lending survey clearly indicate that loan supply conditions for enterprises in the area are continuing to improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.22,0)">Finally, what about the risks to financial stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The ongoing economic recovery should help bolster the income and earnings position of euro area households and non-financial corporations, thereby mitigating the risks associated with a continued debt overhang which persists in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">At the same time, the recovery of euro area real estate markets has gained further momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">While overall residential property valuations remain contained, prime commercial property valuations have moved above long-term averages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Against this backdrop, as highlighted in the ECB’s latest Financial Stability Review, the best way to counter any potentially emerging risk in any market segment is targeted action by the macroprudential authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.22,0)">As is well known from the academic literature, the “physical lower bound” of short-term nominal interest rates is equal to the opportunity costs of holding cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.35,0)">Monetary developments in the euro area show no signs of cash substitution, indicating that we are still far away from the physical lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.13,0)">Central bankers should however be mindful of a potential “economic lower bound”, at which the detrimental effects of low rates on the banking sector outweigh their benefits, and further rate cuts risk reversing the expansionary monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The ECB is mindful of these risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.37,0)">In the euro area, the potential adverse impact on bank profitability, if it materialises, would be compounded by low growth prospects and a legacy of high non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">The current conditions of financial intermediation suggest, however, that the economic lower bound is safely below the current level of the deposit facility rate and that the impact of negative rates, combined with the APP and forward guidance, has clearly been net positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.21,0)">Indeed, we should not look at the implications of negative interest rates in isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Negative nominal rates have reinforced forward guidance in the euro area, sped up the process of portfolio rebalancing associated with the APP and supported the effectiveness of the recent targeted longer-term refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.5,0)">But there can be cumulative effects on financial intermediation and financial stability if rates remain very low for a very long time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">One might argue that disintermediation may have benign effects if non-bank entities are equally capable of collecting and channelling savings, while being less vulnerable to the adverse effects of negative interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The shift towards a more market-based financial structure, as promoted by the European Union’s capital markets union project, would then help our economy cope with a longer period of very low or negative rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.04,0)">But there is a limit to this argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.26,0)">Non-banks are also affected by very low rates: for example, fixed net asset value money market funds may not be able to maintain the value of their shares close to par, while asset managers and insurance companies face the same shrinking margins as banks.</span><span

facility rate set at its current negative level, are proving to be effective in lifting inflation towards its medium-term objective and reducing the overall level of risk in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Fiscal and structural policies should act more decisively to support aggregate demand and productivity, thereby preventing the economy from falling into a low interest rate trap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">And banks should adapt continually to the changing environment by adjusting their business models, cutting their operating costs and reducing their non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In doing so, they will also improve their resilience to a prolonged period of very low rates.</span><span
