    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.13,0)"> ECB-CFS Research Network on 'Capital markets and financial integration in Europe' Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board European Central Bank, at the ECB-CFS workshop policy panel on 'European Securities Settlement Systems' Athens, 21 November 2003 The starting point – lack of integration The European securities infrastructure today is highly fragmented with over 30 national exchanges, about 20 national clearing and settlement institutions in the EU and another 20 systems in the accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.9,0)">Despite its single currency, the euro-area infrastructure as a subset of the overall European infrastructure is equally fragmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">No other currency area has ever had to cope with a similar degree of fragmentation of its securities infrastructure, which is the result of the fact that the euro area has inherited the infrastructures of its member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.82,0)">The securities infrastructure in Europe is often blamed for being inefficient and costly, which has repeatedly been captured by the stylised but misleading assertion that the "European settlement is ten times as expensive as American settlement".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.99,0)">This figure is misleading because the euro area or the EU is not a single country like the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.78,0)">It is not very useful to compare the cost of domestic clearing and settlement within a single system in a single country   with the cost of clearing and settling across several systems in several countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.01,0)">Fragmentation is a problem because the security, the buyer and the seller may not be linked to the same settlement system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In this case, some kind of intermediation is needed, which can either be through a custodian or another settlement system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.33,0)">Any form of intermediation, however, is a source of cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.34,0)">This cost has to be recovered somewhere, so investor services are more expensive, and less competitive internationally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Although the total cost to the European economy is hard to calculate, it is likely to be significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">It is clear, therefore, that further consolidation and/or more competition will be needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">A process of reshaping the current state of the European infrastructure is inevitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Traditionally, countries   developed their own coherent "domestic" infrastructure in terms of securities trading, clearing and settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">It seems plausible to assume that a similarly coherent infrastructure for the euro area as a whole could be equally beneficial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But it is unclear what the final architecture will look like and how far the consolidation process should ideally go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Do we need a single provider of clearing and settlement services in order to make full use of scale economies, or do we need a small number of providers competing with one another in order to make use of the benefits of competition?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.44,0)">It is also unclear what role the public and in particular central banks should play in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Shaping the infrastructure for the euro – is there a case for public action?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is often argued that there is a public good element inherent in the payment and settlement system industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Indeed, payment and settlement systems typically exhibit positive externalities because not only the participants, but also the economy as a whole benefit from the smooth functioning of payment and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">From that perspective, it is evident that the public has an interest in sound payment and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Whether that would justify some form of public intervention, however, is difficult to say.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.46,0)">How difficult it is to define the role of the public in network economies can also be illustrated by recent experiences in the utility industries such as telecommunications, electricity, transportation, water supply etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In the field of payment systems, central banks have traditionally acted as operators of large-value payment systems to ensure the smooth and reliable implementation of their monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.94,0)">To the extent that central bank credit needs to be collateralised, this argument may also apply to securities clearing and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In fact, many central banks have been active in the provision of clearing and settlement services, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.79,0)">for government bonds used as collateral for central bank credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The Eurosystem, however, has adopted an alternative approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">We also use private securities settlement systems for the collateralisation of central bank credit provided that they comply with a number of standards that we have to set up in order to ensure the smooth functioning of these systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Regardless of the question of whether central banks should operate their own systems, there is a role for central banks to foster the process of integration in the clearing and settlement industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">On the one hand, there is clear theoretical and empirical evidence that in many markets, market-driven solutions are generally best at allocating resources efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Therefore, we would expect market forces to lead to an efficient securities infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.09,0)">On the other hand, markets may fail if constraints on market forces prevent their coming into force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.48,0)">In particular, market power and the lack of competition may hamper further consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.97,0)">The work of the Giovannini Group has identified a number of barriers to efficient cross-border clearing and settlement in the EU due to a lack of competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">While it is clear that the elimination of these barriers is a necessary condition for an efficient infrastructure to emerge, it is less clear whether it is also a sufficient condition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">In theory, once the barriers have been removed, market forces can develop freely and an efficient market infrastructure could emerge - unless there are some forms of market failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In fact, there is some indication that there could be a need for public intervention in addition to removing obstacles to integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.92,0)">The complexity of the different interests at stake has an impact on the competitive environment of the securities service industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.15,0)">The markets have difficulties in allocating the overall benefits that can be reaped from the shift to a consolidated infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Those who would bear the costs of integration are not necessarily the same players who would derive most of the benefits from it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.77,0)">As the net benefits of consolidation are not shared evenly, users and providers of clearing and settlement services can have different strategic interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.72,0)">Differences in strategic interest arise not only between the various institutions involved in clearing and settlement, but even within individual institutions because of the multiple roles that a single entity can play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Some institutions   may benefit from fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Since they are in many cases also the owners of the settlement system, they may have both an interest and the power to maintain fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.17,0)">In addition, there is a timing difference which produces conflicts between short-term and long-term gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.4,0)">Finally, the existence of what is sometimes referred to as "silos", i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.72,0)">vertically integrated structures, further adds to the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">For example, an exchange that owns a settlement system can "encourage" its users to settle in the settlement system it owns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In this regard, it is of interest to take note of some examples of public intervention in the both in the US and in European Countries, like Italy, France, the UK or Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">All these examples have two things in common.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">First, some form of public intervention either by the legislator, the securities regulator, or the central bank was used to effect changes in the national securities infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Second, the objective of these interventions was always to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the domestic securities industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Given the degree of fragmentation of the domestic securities infrastructure for the euro, it is tempting to ask the question of whether similar action might be needed today at an euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me therefore briefly explain the ECB's view and role in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The ECB's view and role The ECB clearly supports the view expressed among others by the Lamfalussy Committee of Wise Men that the consolidation process should in general be driven by market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, this is not to say that there is no reason for central banks to be interested and involved in the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">On the contrary, the consolidation process touches one of the key responsibilities of the Eurosystem because efficient and safe securities clearing and settlement systems are a necessary condition for integrated capital markets, the sound execution of monetary policy, the smooth functioning of payment systems and the preservation of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In general, because of the complexity of the consolidation process and the different interests at stake, the final outcome of the current process of reshaping the securities industry will be the result not only of competition and market forces, but also of co-operation between market participants and public authorities and, eventually, policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">At a minimum, the role of central banks spans three main fields and the ECB/Eurosystem has been active in all three of these areas: Removing obstacles to consolidation: The Eurosystem shares the view of the Committee of Wise Men that public policy should focus on competition issues and on removing obstacles which make consolidation difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This will facilitate competition between different clearing and settlement systems across the EU, without favouring any particular model of consolidation and leaving this process in the hands of the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.31,0)">There is no need to repeat the activities recommended by the Committee of Wise Men or the Giovannini Group or the activities included in the Financial Services Action Plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">The ECB supports the work of the European Commission in this area and welcomes in particular the extension of the Investment Services Directive to include clearing and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The Eurosystem's contribution to removing obstacles to consolidation mainly focuses on acting as a catalyst for improvement by encouraging discussions among the relevant players, and, last but not least, on harmonising central bank procedures and operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">In addition, the ECB will help to remove some of the barriers as identified by the Giovannini Group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.24,0)">Setting standards: There is a risk that clearing and settlement systems do not adopt effective risk management standards in a uniform way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.25,0)">Weaknesses in clearing and settlement arrangements can be a source of systemic disturbances to securities markets and to other systems, thus creating negative externalities that need to be internalised by effective regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Moreover, competition between systems entails the risk that the service providers might try to improve competitiveness by applying more lenient risk management standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.11,0)">Finally, given the potential systemic effects of the failure of a major clearing and settlement system, the system operators might assume that central banks will bail it out if necessary and might therefore not have sufficient incentives to address risks effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Against this background, irrespective of the arrangements with other authorities, the Eurosystem takes the view that the establishment of public standards for risk management is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In fact, the Eurosystem has set standards that securities settlement systems need to comply with in order to be eligible for the use in ESCB credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Ensuring an integrated regulatory and oversight framework: It is essential that co-operation with all the relevant authorities establishes effective risk management standards for clearing and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Securities regulators and central banks have already initiated a discussion of these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">At G10 level, for example, the CPSS-IOSCO Joint Task Force has established standards for securities settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The fruitful experience gained here has encouraged similar work to be undertaken at EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">For this purpose, the ESCB co-operates with the Committee of European Securities Regulators, primarily with the aim to assess how the G10 recommendations should be adopted and implemented throughout Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Of course, I should like to take this opportunity to emphasise that, should it ever turn out that these measures are insufficient for the creation of a safe and efficient securities infrastructure in Europe in due time, the Eurosystem will consider further, more active steps to foster integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The examples of public intervention that I mentioned earlier could serve as a reference point for this purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Whether, when and how this should happen, research can help to clarify.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Need for further research Questions to be addressed in this regard could be: How competitive is the European securities infrastructure really?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Is there evidence of market power?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.83,0)">Does any form of market failure exist and is there, from an economic perspective, a case for public intervention?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">If there is a case for public intervention, what kind of interventions could be appropriate?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.66,0)">What would be the constraints for such interventions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Network externalities and scale economies suggest a high degree of concentration, possibly a duopoly or even a monopoly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.51,0)">But fully consolidated networks also present certain negative externalities, for example high systemic and contagion risks, or inadequate incentives for providers to innovate and enhance services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Recent experience in the development of network industries such as telecommunication, electricity, transportation etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">suggests that network externalities and economies of scales do not necessarily imply a monopoly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Even if a more competitive approach to organising the network industries is taken, however, a minimum level of concentration may be required in order to permit optimisation of the conditions for providing the services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">What lessons can we learn from research on other network industries like telecommunications or the railway industry?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.74,0)">What are the similarities and what are the differences between these industries and the securities settlement industry?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">For instance, what has proven right for the telecommunications does not necessarily need to be the right approach for securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.83,0)">In fact, the industrial organisation of the securities industry appears still very much under-researched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In the present workshop a first step has been made, in a field that has not really known academic research in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The ECB hopes that more research answering the questions mentioned above emerges from this "seed", supporting policies in the field of the European securities settlement industry.</span>
