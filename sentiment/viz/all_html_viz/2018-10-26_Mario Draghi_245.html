    <h1> Central bank independence </h1>
    <h2> First Lamfalussy Lecture by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Banque Nationale de Belgique, Brussels, 26 October 2018 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)"> Central bank independence First Lamfalussy Lecture by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Banque Nationale de Belgique, Brussels, 26 October 2018 Advanced economies are now emerging from the aftermath of the great financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Despite facing the largest shock in the postwar period, central banks have succeeded in maintaining price stability and fulfilling their mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">A key factor behind this has been central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.87,0)">But in spite of its benefits, its desirability and relevance are nowadays being increasingly challenged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The evolution of central bank independence The rationale for delegating powers to independent central banks evolved mainly from the experience of the 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">At that time, policymakers believed that there was a stable trade-off between unemployment and inflation, whereby monetary policy could achieve permanently higher employment at the cost of slightly higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The trade-off rested on the notion that an increase in the money supply could boost aggregate demand and stimulate employment, while keeping inflation expectations well anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.09,0)">This policy was revealed to be time-inconsistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.33,0)">Over time, commitments to control inflation at a later date lost credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The public came to anticipate the behaviour of monetary policy and quickly embedded expectations of higher inflation in their price setting and wage bargaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.31,0)">The trade-off between unemployment and inflation disappeared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In the United States, for example, year-ahead inflation expectations rose steadily from around 4% in 1970 to 12% in 1979.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Inflation stood between 3% and 12% for the whole decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.38,0)">But there was no fall in unemployment, which varied between 4% and 9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In fact, inflation and unemployment had a tendency to rise in tandem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Therefore, to overcome time-inconsistency, central banks had to regain credibility as institutions capable of delivering price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">They thus committed to a non-inflationary path while resisting any political pressure to pursue objectives other than price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">As Alesina and Summers showed, central banks that acted in this way – such as the Bundesbank – had managed to achieve lower inflation without suffering output or employment penalties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.03,0)">Annual inflation in Germany from 1970 to 1990 averaged just 3.8%, whereas in France it averaged 7.9% and in Italy 11.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.54,0)">At the same time, unemployment in Germany over the same period averaged just 3.6%, whereas in France it was 5.6% and in Italy 6.4%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Societies gradually converged on a framework whereby monetary policy was removed from the pressures of short-term political agendas and delegated to independent central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">A clear social consensus had emerged that price stability was a common good under all circumstances, but its achievement depended on the right institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This rested on three elements: central banks needed a clear mandate to achieve price stability; they needed independence over the instruments they could use to achieve their mandate; and monetary policy had to be embedded in a strong accountability framework requiring the central bank to explain how its decisions contributed to its goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This framework offered the public a guarantee that independent central banks would not exercise power arbitrarily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.63,0)">Their discretion was limited to how they formulated monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.64,0)">They had no discretion over whether to pursue their goals, and what goal they had to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is on this basis that the mandate of the European Central Bank was established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">For much of the 1990s and early 2000s, the monetary policy framework went unquestioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">There was a broad consensus that granting independence to central banks had been successful in bringing inflation under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.64,0)">Cross-country studies found a clear negative relationship between independence and inflation in OECD economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Moreover, central bank independence was seen as a key factor in the lower volatility of output and inflation observed over this period – the phenomenon identified as the “great moderation”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.06,0)">The variability of real output growth was found to have declined by half since the mid-1980s, while the variability of inflation had declined by about two thirds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Importantly, central banks had been able to maintain low and stable inflation using a single instrument – policy interest rates – which caused few concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Interest rate policy was perceived to be a normal tool of monetary policy and to create few distributional effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.47,0)">Then the great financial crisis erupted, which led to a steep drop in both output and inflation across advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.57,0)">This presented central banks with two new challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The first challenge was to their objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.64,0)">For the first time in living memory, there was a threat of a deflationary spiral taking hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.65,0)">This would have led not only to central banks failing their mandates, but to the whole economy sinking into a prolonged depression – just as had happened in the 1930s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.42,0)">The second challenge was to their instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.65,0)">Faced with these deflationary threats, central banks responded decisively with conventional policy, but they eventually ran into the lower bound on interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">This required them to adopt new, unconventional measures, such as large-scale asset purchases, to stabilise inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.95,0)">The new environment of low inflation and unconventional policies has led to questions about the key tenets of the pre-crisis monetary policy consensus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.95,0)">Some observers now query whether the circumstances that justified central bank independence still exist – and whether the grounds for delegating monetary policy to independent authorities remain valid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.94,0)">Time-inconsistency under low inflation The first claim is that, in a lower-inflation environment, the time-inconsistency problem that emerged in the 1970s has become less relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As such, independent central banks are no longer a necessity to ensure credibility and keep inflation expectations anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Such reasoning rests on two assumptions: first, that inflationary pressures have, by and large, disappeared in advanced economies; and second, that the social consensus behind price stability is now so well established that elected authorities would not compromise it in the pursuit of other objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.47,0)">Both of these assumptions can be questioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.69,0)">First, the absence of inflationary pressures in recent years is well-explained by two factors, and neither would justify a change to the monetary policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">One is the stability of the monetary regime, which has meant that economic shocks no longer have lasting effects on inflation, either during slumps or during booms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">This is a direct result of the success of central banks over the past twenty years in anchoring expectations and reducing inflation volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.97,0)">So, the response to a stable inflation environment should not be to dismantle the framework that has delivered it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.64,0)">The other factor is the depth of the crisis that struck advanced economies, which created unusually high unemployment and made inflation less responsive as the labour market recovered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">But here, too, little would be gained by making central banks less independent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Long-term institutional arrangements which are based on a strong social consensus should not be changed because of cyclically-driven developments in inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.89,0)">But are there ongoing structural changes in the economy, as some argue, that will permanently contain inflationary pressures in the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The notion that inflation is a non-monetary phenomenon is not new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.98,0)">In 1971, Federal Reserve policymakers argued that inflation was “a structural problem not amenable to macroeconomic measures” , and similar statements can be found in the records of other central banks throughout the 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.36,0)">The Fed’s view only changed when Paul   But it might equally create upward price pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">According to the life-cycle hypothesis, as society ages the elderly will eventually spend their savings and consume more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The impact of technological change, such as the spread of e-commerce, is also unclear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.89,0)">E-commerce could in principle erode the monopolistic power of suppliers, which would reduce mark-ups and flatten the Phillips curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">In other words, lower levels of unemployment would not necessarily lead to faster wage increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.86,0)">But it might also result in suppliers changing prices more frequently, which would result in a steeper Phillips curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.58,0)">In any event, the effects of structural changes cannot create steady-state disinflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">They can only lead to a potentially long transition to a new steady state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.36,0)">Whether inflation is higher or lower over time will depend on the reaction of monetary policy along the way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">And what recent experience suggests is that independent central banks remain the best institutions to anchor inflation expectations through such transitions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This brings me to the second assumption about the incentives of elected authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The belief that they will no longer compromise price stability in the pursuit of other short-term objectives is not borne out by what we have seen in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.62,0)">In fact, it has become evident that time-inconsistency is a recurring risk that arises in both high- and low-inflation environments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">When inflation is rising, short-term political considerations still create a certain set of incentives to pressure central banks into prioritising economic growth and avoiding monetary tightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And when inflation is falling, we have seen that there are incentives to prioritise considerations of moral hazard and financial sector concerns and to oppose monetary easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Such incentives were visible in the euro area during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.7,0)">Despite an observable slide in inflation, there were those who opposed responding with unconventional measures, because they feared the possible effects on governments’ willingness to enact reforms, or on banks’ incentives to clean up their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">These risks were given priority over the certainty that price stability would be sacrificed without action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">And today in other jurisdictions, we see concerns being publicly expressed about whether the central bank should pursue a normalisation path in the face of rising inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">These deeds have so far had limited consequences only because central banks are independent and credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.58,0)">But if central banks were less independent, and the public perceived that monetary policy could be pressured in either direction, it would eventually de-anchor inflation expectations and jeopardise price stability – just as in the 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.05,0)">The relationship between monetary and fiscal policy The crisis has also prompted questions about the relationship between monetary and fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.63,0)">First, it is claimed that, once central banks use unconventional measures that entail buying large volumes of government bonds, they cross the boundary into fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In doing so, they exceed their mandates and the scope of their independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.79,0)">Such reasoning ignores key aspects of our institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The specific design of central banks’ mandates – which gives them independence over their tools, but not their goals – was put in place because no one could foresee all the challenges that monetary policy might face in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Allowing central banks leeway over their instruments was the best way to ensure that, come what may, the social consensus in favour of price stability could be maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The actions of central banks during the crisis not only followed this principle to the letter – they demonstrated precisely why it was necessary in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.01,0)">With conventional policy no longer sufficient to secure price stability, central banks would have failed their mandates without instrument independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">But by expanding their set of tools, they extended their policy space so that they could deliver their objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Though the measures we used were unprecedented, the shift was only in form, not in function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Their function was exactly the same as that of conventional policy: to increase money and credit aggregates, lift demand and stabilise medium-term inflation around our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Indeed, Milton Friedman argued that asset purchases are not only an appropriate tool of monetary policy, they are ‒ under certain circumstances ‒ essential to boost money supply and maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">He therefore supported their use during deflationary episodes such as the Great Depression or Japan in the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">The fact that deploying asset purchases was fully in line with our mandate was confirmed by the European Court of Justice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In its judgement on our Outright Monetary Transactions programme, it ruled that purchases of government bonds are legal under the ECB’s statute and a legitimate tool of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.15,0)">Another challenge to central bank independence is related to the effectiveness of monetary policy at the lower bound on interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.85,0)">When interest rates fall towards zero, it is argued, monetary policy becomes ineffective, since it enters a “liquidity trap” where it can no longer stimulate demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In these conditions, fiscal policy is needed to stabilise inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">For as long as interest rates remain constrained by the lower bound, the argument goes, monetary policy should therefore support fiscal policy to achieve price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.01,0)">But central bank independence, it is said, impedes such coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.05,0)">To begin with, the notion that monetary policy is ineffective when the lower bound is reached has been disproved by the experience of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">There is now a wealth of evidence showing that the unconventional policies adopted by central banks have eased financing conditions, boosted output and stabilised inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In the ECB’s case, there was a particular question about whether our asset purchases would be effective in a bank-based economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.75,0)">But we estimate that the growth rate of bank lending to euro area firms would be more than a third lower today without our package of credit-easing measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The rates that banks charge for firms to borrow money would have been around 50% higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">This is not to say that monetary policy could not benefit from greater alignment with fiscal policy when faced with a deep slump.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.14,0)">In the euro area, it was clear that the lack of a supportive aggregate fiscal stance was a headwind for monetary policy during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">But for such policy alignment to be successful, it has to be on the basis of every authority fulfilling its own mandate in full independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.4,0)">The existence of multiple actors in setting macroeconomic policy requires clear mandates to avoid what Milton Friedman described as the “dispersal of responsibility, which promotes shirking of responsibility in times of uncertainty and difficulty”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.05,0)">Moreover, if central banks were to enter into a form of coordination with fiscal authorities that reduced their independence, it would ultimately be self-defeating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.47,0)">While the mandate of the ECB is price stability, fiscal authorities have multiple mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.44,0)">So, if the central bank were to submit to political control, coordination with fiscal authorities would be unlikely to be limited to the lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Fiscal authorities would have an incentive to use monetary policy to achieve other objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.18,0)">And this would end up with monetary policy becoming fiscally dominated, which history shows is inconsistent with price stability in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.74,0)">Distributional effects of unconventional measures The third claim against central bank independence relates to the distributional effects of unconventional policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In particular, it is argued that the distributional effects are much larger than for conventional policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.28,0)">But the delegation of monetary policy to an independent body rests on the premise that such effects are not first order.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.64,0)">Unconventional policies are perceived to have larger distributional effects because they involve active intervention in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">And conventional policies are perceived to have lower distributional effects because they entail passively providing liquidity to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.76,0)">But this is an incorrect perception, for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.08,0)">First, conventional policies also produce differing effects on creditors and debtors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Second, empirical evidence suggests the effects on distribution of both conventional and unconventional policies are in any case limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the long run, monetary policy is not an important factor for the distribution of resources within societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.99,0)">Distribution is affected more by low-frequency developments such as structural and institutional factors, or fiscal policies such as tax regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.44,0)">In the short run, monetary policy can influence distribution via two channels: a direct effect related to asset prices and financial income, and an indirect effect related to the macroeconomic impact of expansionary policy on jobs and wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">But the net effect on distribution appears to be balanced, including with unconventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Across households, research finds that our unconventional measures have barely affected wealth inequality, because they have had a positive impact on housing wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is fairly evenly distributed across households and dominates wealth held in stocks and bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.7,0)">Furthermore, while some savers have seen their financial income reduced by lower interest rates, asset purchases have at the same time triggered both a sizeable reduction in unemployment and wage increases for the employed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In fact, households with the lowest incomes and the fewest liquid assets have benefited in particular from monetary easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.97,0)">Estimates suggest that asset purchases by the central bank leading to a 30 basis point decline in the term spread, reduce the unemployment rate among households in the bottom income quintile by 2 percentage points, and contribute to a modest drop in the Gini coefficient on gross income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">So, the positive effect on employment – which has risen by 9 million in the euro area since the trough of the crisis – counterbalances any potential negative distributional effects of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">And the same appears to be true in other advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The distributional effects of monetary policy across member states are similarly balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.07,0)">If we look at how the net interest income of different countries has been affected by falling interest rates since 2008, we do not see a picture of “creditor” countries losing out and “debtor” countries gaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In fact, despite having a large net international investment position, Germany has gained slightly from low rates – meaning it has received more in interest earnings than it has disbursed in interest payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">At the same time, all member states have benefited from the economic recovery and the stable macroeconomic environment, which were enabled by our expansionary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.01,0)">Since the launch of our measures, the dispersion of growth and unemployment rates have fallen to their lowest level since the start of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.82,0)">So, there is little to suggest that the use of unconventional measures during the crisis has created first-order distributional effects – and certainly not to an extent that would undermine the rationale for central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.89,0)">And perhaps more importantly, the distributional effects of not acting to defend our mandate would have been severe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.02,0)">This would have resulted in a fundamental shift in growth and inflation expectations, triggering a deflationary spiral, with significant implications in particular for the poorer and younger members of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.89,0)">The continuing value of central bank independence These various arguments against central bank independence also miss a more fundamental point, which is the value of an independent central bank that can act decisively without political pressure – and especially in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.05,0)">Indeed, we saw clearly during the euro area crisis that coordinated policy responses among governments were difficult to achieve, tended to arise only under severe market pressure, and then often turned out to be insufficient, requiring further responses later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In this context, the governance structure of the Eurosystem – where each member state is represented by the governor of its central bank in their own personal capacity, who is not bound in their decision-making by their nationality – was essential, since it facilitated an effective systemic response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">A central bank that was both independent and built to serve the whole of the euro area, and not individual member states, was able to create the required policy space in an extremely difficult context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This brings me to my conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.64,0)">Central banks are powerful, independent and unelected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This combination can only be squared if they have a clearly defined mandate for which they are held accountable by the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is legislators that define the mandate that establishes the goals of monetary policymaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And it is legislators that are responsible for holding central banks accountable for the effectiveness of their monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">But for effectiveness, credibility is essential, and therefore legislators must want a credible central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Credibility hinges on independence: the central bank should not be subject to fiscal or political dominance and should be free to choose the instruments that are most appropriate to deliver its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Legislators should therefore protect the independence of central banks, as it is essential for fulfilling the mandate that they themselves have defined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.65,0)">The distributional consequences of monetary policy, if there are any, and other risks such as moral hazard and financial stability, must be addressed by other tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">These include fiscal policies, macroprudential policies and banking supervision – policies that are more targeted and therefore inherently more appropriate for close scrutiny by legislators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Faced with future crises, central banks will adhere to their mandates and use their independence to fulfil them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In our case, the ruling of the European Court of Justice has shown that we can use all the tools within our mandate to tackle future challenges to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">We cannot foresee now what those challenges might be, but if and when they arise, they may require us to adjust our policy space once more to meet our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The instruments we deploy in such conditions, and the safeguards that accompany them, will be commensurate with the nature of the challenges we face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">And it is crucial that we are at all times transparent and accountable in our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">and Prescott, E.  , “Rules Rather than Discretion: The Inconsistency of Optimal Plans”, Journal of Political Economy,
