    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)"> Economic Policy and the Need for Humility Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Conference “Banking and Financial Regulation”, Bocconi University, 9 October 2017 “  five years from now the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model that central bankers worship like Baal will still be there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.44,0)">There will be a few changes to the parameters, and maybe a constraint or two added like temple lamps, but apparently they never learn.”   John Dizard The policy maker’s environment is a multi-faceted one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.48,0)">She or he faces a continually changing economic landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me give you some specific examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.13,0)">Economic data -- upon which we base our policy decisions -- appear at different times and with different qualities: for instance, some economic series   are subject to considerable revision over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.14,0)">Moreover, the transmission lags of monetary policy changes are often long, uncertain, and perhaps even contingent on the state of economy  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.63,0)">Last, but certainly not least, policy making itself does not operate in a vacuum or in a laboratory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.15,0)">There is the practical backdrop of legal, constitutional, cultural, and political economy constraints etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Experience, judgement and the acknowledgement of uncertainty are key parts of that environment, and key parts of the policy maker’s outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">To help assess economic developments and to facilitate policy discussion, though, central banks use a variety of macroeconomic models and econometric tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Despite the sophisticated tools and analysis at our disposal, the uncertainty underlining the policy environment is pervasive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Accordingly, I believe policy makers must show humility in their understanding of how the economy works, and how policy works.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Before the financial crisis many distinguished policy makers and academics treated economics and finance as if it had attained something of a natural science – replete with regularities upon which most economists could, and seemingly did, agree.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.17,0)">Indeed, some even declared the business cycle dead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.68,0)">The doubters meanwhile   were either neglected or – what is worse – labelled luddites.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.57,0)">The global financial crisis challenged such complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In effect, it shone a light on our over confidence and, exposed our very lack of humility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.85,0)">More philosophically, the crisis also suggested that we, as a profession, had perhaps lost touch with an older tradition of economics that had precisely sought to emphasise uncertainty, the limits of information, and the wider social context underlining economic interactions -- as for instance, highlighted by von Mises and Hayek “economic calculation problem” and Hayek’s “fatal conceit” which submits that knowledge is dispersed across society and can never truly be known by any one agent or entity  - a fact that the former chief economist of the ECB, Otmar Issing, never failed to remind us of.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.89,0)">Notwithstanding, the inescapable fact is that policy makers must make decisions under uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.16,0)">Such uncertainty is not, in addition, a temporary phenomenon that we can wait out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.72,0)">As former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan   wrote: “... uncertainty is not just a pervasive feature of the monetary policy landscape; it is the defining characteristic of that landscape”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.0,0)">Given this complexity and the need to stabilize market expectations, policy makers have traditionally relied on a variety of macro-econometric and statistical models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">These tools come with many caveats.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.83,0)">Indeed, many were the first to point an accusatory finger at such modelling frameworks in the aftermath of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.06,0)">The main criticisms were that models were missing key features of the economy   and/or were based on unrealistic assumptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Examples of the latter include the assumption of “complete” and “efficient” markets as well as of “rational” expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.81,0)">These features make it difficult for models to speak to real-world phenomena such as herd behaviour in markets, asset price misalignments, sudden stops etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.57,0)">The overreliance on mathematics and models leads to a failure of acknowledging the crucial role of social behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.01,0)">Of course, all models make simplifying assumptions, otherwise they wouldn’t be models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Or, as the statistician George Box famously noted, “All models are wrong; some models are useful.” Indeed, there is an active research agenda to incrementally but carefully improve our existing models: examples include integrating “financial frictions” and so-called heterogeneous agents which inject more realistic dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Moreover, many have also sought out insights from machine learning and big data techniques, and from behavioural and evolutionary economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The latter try to explain departures from optimality in agents’ decisions, and integrate the social fabric and consumer heuristics underlying economic behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">As the economy advances and grows yet more complex, innovation in our modelling and statistical frameworks will undoubtedly continue, but fail in its pretention to encapsulate human complexity in an equation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.58,0)">The fact that all models are wrong does not preclude their combination from being useful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We know that combining models – even often using simple pairing rules – regularly outperform the best individual model in forecasting exercises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Likewise, the robust policy literature has combined macroeconomic models to ask which types of policies are likely to work well across many different models and scenarios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">This seems a reasonable research agenda, although it is unclear if the models are close to being useful for analysis of macro-prudential and financial stability issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.95,0)">Macro-prudential policy is a good example of this pretence lacking even a capacity to define its own objective otherwise then by its negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In the remainder of my remarks I will elaborate on the challenges faced by central banks related to uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I highlight merits and limitations of models, and I comment on different area that researchers are currently working on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Monetary policy and financial regulation under uncertainty Uncertainty is the defining characteristic of monetary policy landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The literature distinguishes several types, so it is worth starting by describing it to continue later on how economists have thought about it and how they have tried to tackle it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.75,0)">First, there is Knightian uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.96,0)">This is the type of uncertainty that is immeasurable and thus not possible to calculate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.95,0)">Typically it relates to the inability of agents or decision makers to reasonably contemplate all the possible states of nature or characterize their probability distributions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.74,0)">If, on the other hand, the realization of the states of nature is not known in advance but agents can reasonably contemplate all such states and their likelihood, this situation is commonly known as risk  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.18,0)">Others tend to distinguish between aleatory   uncertainty and epistemic  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Ultimately, all uncertainty relevant for decision making is subjective, but for practical purposes it is worth making the distinction because there are cumulative effects of the two uncertainties that can explain events such as the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.81,0)">As Oliver Blanchard commented: “… what is at work is not only objective, but also subjective uncertainty … Subjective uncertainty is about “unknown unknowns”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.69,0)">When, as today, the unknown unknowns dominate, and the economic environment is so complex as to appear nearly incomprehensible, the result is extreme prudence, if not outright paralysis, on the part of investors, consumers and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And this behaviour, in turn, feeds the crisis”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.91,0)">Uncertainty can be related to many dimensions relevant to policy making, including   uncertainty about the current state of the economy,   uncertainty about its structure; and   uncertainty over the way economic agents form expectations about future developments and future policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me give you some concrete examples of such dimensions relying on unobservables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">First, consider the famous Taylor rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.5,0)">This relates changes in monetary policy rates to changes in inflation and the output gap, anchored around some notion of the equilibrium real interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.09,0)">By and large, the rule assumes fixed coefficients for these feedbacks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Even though policy makers never mechanically follow such a rule, over a long horizon, it can ex post provide a good description of monetary-policy setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Policy-making, however, as opposed to academia is forward looking – unless one believes with Karl Marx that history repeats itself as a farce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.33,0)">Consider now the effect of monetary policy when interest rates are around their effective lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.7,0)">Given the limited experience policy makers have of such episodes, there is deep uncertainty as to whether the normal rules of the game   will continue to provide a broad guide for monetary decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.65,0)">Moreover, estimates of potential output and thus the output gap have inevitably been blurred by the scarring of the financial crisis, as well as by rapid technological changes throughout the last decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In line with this, at the Bank for Internal Settlements, Borio has argued that we must supplement traditional measures of output gaps with measures of financial imbalances and credit cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There is however no unambiguous way to do this given the many different methods of filtering data and extracting trend and cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.32,0)">Moreover, macroeconomic data samples are limited relative to the infrequent nature of crises to make these discriminations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.51,0)">Likewise, forecasts of inflation are increasingly difficult to make in a globalized world: there are many common trends in inflation determinants, and common shocks such as in commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Accordingly, domestic factors – such as wage setting – may matter far less than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.06,0)">Finally, estimates of the so-called natural real rate of interest, always understood to be difficult to pin down, are in an interdependent world beset by many “headwinds”  , as argued by Gordon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.04,0)">It is very difficult to be able to say how such headwinds will evolve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In the same context other scholars even identify tailwinds: Brynjolfsson and McAfee find that technological advance has caused a drastic shift in the means of production, simultaneously boosting the productivity of firms which are however difficult to measure with traditional gauges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">All of these examples relate to stabilization policy over the cycles – but it goes well beyond that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.53,0)">Consider regulatory policy, given the expansion in recent decades of the financial sector and its changing nature  , the optimal design of regulatory policy in such a changing landscape is profoundly complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.17,0)">Uncertainty though does not   prevent the central bank from taking informed decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">How do we ensure that we avoid paralysis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.9,0)">Given the complexity and the need to stabilize market expectations, academics and researchers have traditionally relied on a variety of econometric models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Policy makers supplement these models, with expert judgement to shed light on economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.08,0)">The use of models inevitably introduces other dimensions of uncertainty which all go under the name of model uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.11,0)">It is possible to classify risk within a model, where the uncertainty is about the outcomes that emerge in accordance with a model that specifies fully the outcome set of probabilities; and ambiguity among models, where the uncertainty is about which alternative model should be used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.16,0)">If the true model is not assumed to be among the original set of models under consideration, a third source of uncertainty emerges, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.56,0)">model misspecification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.85,0)">Uncertainty has been one very important aspect of the policy environment and of the models used that the economic professions has been forced to think more deeply about with the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.7,0)">But many other features of the models have been at the centre of the discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Reflections on the Models Let me now elaborate more fully on policy models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.78,0)">Many prominent economists   concluded that today’s mainstream macroeconomic models somehow had led the profession down the wrong path  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.94,0)">In other words that these models suffer from misspecification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.01,0)">There are also examples in finance: mainstream financial economists possessed an incomplete understanding of the correlation of different assets, perhaps excessive faith in the risk-reducing potential of the securitization and a blinkered Gaussian mind-set.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In short they used models – often of great sophistication – but poorly combined them with judgement and experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">As we noted, many have reached a relatively positive assessment of policy models, and of the re-constructive abilities of the profession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.74,0)">Indeed, some others argued that the mistake was actually in not following models’ prescriptions closely enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.48,0)">For instance John Taylor maintained that during the early 2000s, monetary policy in the US was set looser than that implied by the Taylor Rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.45,0)">This, he claimed, caused the build-up of debt and risk-taking, which ultimately led to the onset of the Great Recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.84,0)">Likewise, Michael Wicken concluded that “… the financial crisis was brought about more by a failure to employ modern macroeconomics than by its failings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.53,0)">If used sensibly, it will lead us out of the crisis.”   On the other side, those who criticize the types of macroeconomic models popular at central banks have argued that they mistook beauty for truth and were too complex and opaque to be used quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.04,0)">More recently Stiglitz posed another question highlighting one important flaw of models: why does the economy not quickly return to full employment, as one would have expected in an equilibrium model?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.64,0)">Why do we persist in using models with such strongly counterfactual dynamics?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.23,0)">More specifically the list of model troubles could include: linearity, rational expectations, complete markets, limited agent heterogeneity and financial imperfections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">On a more general perspective, some set the discussion in terms of the fact that some models give the impression of the possibility to fine tune or socially “engineer” the economy whereas less standard approaches – also inspired by other disciplines – see the economy rather as an ever-evolving social system for which one can merely set the broad framework conditions and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This goes back to an old debate started indeed with Ludwig von Mises, who first discussed the concept of catalaxy, and made popular later on by Friedrich Hayek who elaborated on that concept and defined it as follows: “… the order brought about by the mutual adjustment of many individual economies in a market”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.2,0)">Hayek particularly stressed his view in that respect in his lecture to the memory of Alfred Nobel, The Pretence of Knowledge in which he forcefully challenged all those who believed that government had the wisdom or ability to successfully plan the economic affairs of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">His primary targets were the Keynesian economists at that time who were confident that they could manage the economy to assure full employment, economic growth, and market stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.72,0)">Hayek’s more general antagonists were social engineers who wished to redesign and regulate society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.44,0)">The terms of the current debate are similarly along those lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Way forward/implications for research and policy One possible reaction by fine-tuners to this uncertainty is to rely on Machine learning and Big Data techniques to deliver forecasts and enhance policy analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.46,0)">As the name implies, such techniques rely on large complex datasets to extract and manipulate correlations and regularities in the data that would otherwise be opaque.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">They have proved popular and valuable in many fields such as advertising, prediction, developing trading strategies, and so on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Indeed, as the economic historian Joel Mokyr provocatively wrote “… who needs causation as long as we have correlation?”   Big Data, however intriguing, is no panacea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.6,0)">Such methods rely on often multi-dimensional correlations fitted   on past data that may bear little relation to future events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.0,0)">Moreover, the relations uncovered by algorithms trawling vast datasets may identify false positives  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.37,0)">But more fundamentally, many problems in social sciences entail a combination of prediction but also causal inference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We need to know for example, if the central bank lowers interest rates below zero or engages in asset purchases, will that stimulate aggregate demand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.61,0)">Central banks have for the most part not engaged in these types of policy before so there is no   historical correlation upon which we can fall back.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">To address such questions, we inevitably rely on our macro-econometric models to give us structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">During the crisis some believe to have seen many examples of policy insights from models  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Moreover, many interesting extensions were fashioned onto existing models in the wake of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">However successful such extensions prove to be, there are still clearly   limits on how big policy models can be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.69,0)">The bigger models are, the more difficult it is to estimate and solve them; the more difficult it is to build a coherent narrative around them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Such narratives are an important ingredient in building consensus around where the economy is and how policy should advance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.38,0)">To lose the big picture in the details is not ideal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">The bottom line is that whilst we should acknowledge the contribution our statistical and macroeconomic models make, we must also acknowledge their limitations and make improvements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.03,0)">We must recognize the presence of pervasive uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We must show humility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">There is hope, and an active research agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Useful insights on how to improve models come from behavioural and evolutionary economics   -- as well as from the enhancement of models to include commercial banks, credit frictions, and uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Also, central banks have always been concerned with uncertainty and they always tried to take robust decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.83,0)">They have also been confronted with the challenge to distinguish between short-term versus long-term, cyclical versus structural developments or deviations of various degrees versus dead ends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.26,0)">The main problem is the difficulty the policy maker faces in distinguishing between objective and subjective uncertainty, and how to cope with the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Possible solutions to uncertainty are on the one hand to relax the assumption that a single probability number quantifies beliefs and assume that they can account on a set of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The policy makers then act according to the belief that minimizes the excepted loss.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.72,0)">On the other hand the risk aversion of policy makers towards the two types of uncertainties is not the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Allowing for the distinction in the attitude towards uncertainty allows us to evaluate their role and quantify their importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">As already stressed, the crises increased the concern for uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">The research agenda is also high on this topic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Conclusions If it did nothing else, the financial crisis served to remind us all of a few home truths.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.98,0)">The economy is a profoundly complex setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is bound and shaped by history as well as by cultural and legal norms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.99,0)">If it can at all be conceived of as a model, such a model would have many moving parts and shifting parameters and volatilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.96,0)">But even then, deep uncertainty inevitably remains – uncertainty about the underlying mechanisms and parameters and the lines of causality between those mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.32,0)">Many economists had in recent years perhaps forgotten that, but as I have argued the study of economics and many practitioners had not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.62,0)">Let me be clear, an acknowledgement of uncertainty is not a recipe for nihilism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">On the contrary, the ECB has shown great flexibility and ingenuity in dealing with the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">For instance, all the available evidence suggests that the range of asset purchases programme has led to material improvements in financial conditions and credit supply conditions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The ECB has marshalled its many models and staff expertise to great effect in these last few admittedly difficult years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Moreover, economists have made a sober assessment of the gaps in their modelling frameworks and made a serious, diligent, and ongoing attempt to fill them whilst retaining model tractability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">In this cause we have and will be guided by the proliferation of large and detailed datasets in our macroeconomic and macro-prudential settings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">And yet the benefit of experience, judgement, and – perhaps above all -- humility remains always to the fore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Dizard, John  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.17,0)">Supply-side shocks confound Fed’s economic models, Financial
