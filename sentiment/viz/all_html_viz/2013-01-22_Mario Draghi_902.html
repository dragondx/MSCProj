    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)"> Address at the New Year’s Reception of the Frankfurt Chamber of Commerce and Industry Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Frankfurt am Main, 22 January 2013 Minister-President Bouffier, Lord Mayor Feldmann, President Müller, Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be here with you this evening, and I would like to thank the Chamber of Commerce and Industry very warmly for inviting me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">I am pleased to meet many representatives of the business community and public life of the region Rhein-Main and Frankfurt, the city in which the ECB is so well hosted and where I also feel personally very comfortable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A New Year’s reception is always the occasion to look back on what has happened in the past year and to look forward to what lies ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.59,0)">2012 was a year full of challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Yet it was also a year of surprises and new beginnings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.97,0)">We began the year in an environment of exceptional uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.0,0)">The euro area was faced with deep, even existential challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.03,0)">This led some experts to make bleak predictions about the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.92,0)">They doubted the resilience of our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.78,0)">They worried about the stability of our single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.26,0)">They even questioned its future existence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">To illustrate just how far some doubts went, let me quote the from the Economist’s annual publication “The World in 2012”, which in the autumn of 2011 said the following: “If you were sitting down with a blank sheet of paper, you would advise the euro zone to complement its one-size-fits-all monetary policy by pooling sovereignty and creating new institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">You would set up a European mini-IMF with enough funds to assist troubled countries that adjust their economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">A pan-European banking regulator and a bail-out fund could ensure that large European banks were not at the mercy of their vulnerable sovereign borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And, to stop governments from exploiting these mechanisms, euro-zone countries would agree to submit their fiscal policies to the say-so of everyone else.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It amounts to a blueprint for the United States of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">And it is utterly beyond reach.”   If we look back at 2012, on virtually all of these issues, Europe is moving forward or is already there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">So the ambition is not “utterly beyond reach”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.05,0)">Indeed, it bears out what Walter Hallstein, the first President of the European Commission, once said: that “anyone who does not believe in miracles in European matters is not a realist”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.9,0)">Due to resolute actions by euro area governments and European institutions, the year 2012 turned out quite differently than predicted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.54,0)">The darkest clouds over the euro area subsided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Countries renewed their commitment to reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">The euro area took strides forward in its common governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Europe’s policy-makers, including the European Central Bank   within its mandate, left no doubts about their commitment to our common currency and to its stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">We can begin 2013 on a more confident note, precisely because significant progress was made during 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Significant progress in 2012 First of all, governments did their part to ensure stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">During the last year, an important change took place “on the ground” in the economies of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The necessary rebalancing of the euro area economy gathered pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">A comprehensive adjustment in the deficit countries is now taking place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Many countries are making solid progress in bringing their public finances under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">They are enacting structural reforms to increase competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">This is especially true for the countries under an EU/IMF programme, where adjustment has been extensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.67,0)">Reducing the imbalances is certainly a difficult and painful process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">But it is essential to restore sustainable public finances and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The people in the countries concerned have broadly understood this and backed this course of action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The progress made deserves public recognition and respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Governments also came together in 2012 to strengthen the euro area and its ability to prevent and react to crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The European Stability Mechanism became active and provides a solid safety net if needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">The new rules for governing the euro area economy were applied to strengthen oversight of budgets and to monitor emerging imbalances more effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.52,0)">Member States agreed to put debt brakes in their national constitutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Most importantly, Europe’s leaders recognised that monetary union needs to be complemented by a financial union, a fiscal union, a genuine economic union and eventually a deeper political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Discussions are underway with clear timelines in the months ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">The most urgent project – financial union – is now taking tangible shape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The ECB is expected to become the single supervisor for the biggest part of the euro area’s banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">This is probably the most significant integration step since the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Advances towards a common resolution framework for dealing with non-viable banks are also in the pipeline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Of course, the ECB also made a contribution in 2012, notably with our special measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">We have shown our commitment to do what is necessary within our mandate to safeguard the stability of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Only a currency whose future existence is not in doubt can be a stable currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Is the ECB still focused on price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">And is it acting in full independence?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I would like to state categorically that the answer to both of these questions is ‘yes’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me start with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">The ECB remains steadfastly committed to its primary mandate of ensuring price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">All of our measures are designed to achieve this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.88,0)">And looking at current and expected inflation rates, there is simply no evidence that could substantiate fears about any deviation from price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.99,0)">Last year, we saw a situation where fears about the future of the euro area were creating fragmentation in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.15,0)">This fragmentation had very tangible consequences for the real economy: bank funding costs diverged significantly across countries, and this led to marked differences in bank lending rates to firms and households across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.69,0)">In some countries, reductions in ECB interest rates were fully passed on; in others, bank lending rates declined only a little, if at all; and in some they even rose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.44,0)">Interest rates do not have to be identical across the euro area, but it is unacceptable if major differences arise from fragmented capital markets or unfounded perceptions about the long-term sustainability of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.74,0)">In an economy like the euro area, where around three quarters of firms’ financing comes from banks, fragmentation has very severe consequences for the real economy, for investment and employment and ultimately for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">We therefore acted to remove unfounded fears about the euro and to safeguard our ability to ensure price stability for the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let me explain how we safeguard our independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.18,0)">In the summer of last year, passive inaction was no more an option because it would have posed the greatest risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Therefore, the ECB, learning from previous experience and in compliance with its mandate, had to act - but it would only intervene within a framework that would ensure full fiscal compliance by the governments concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It is for this reason that there is a requirement of countries having an adjustment programme to be considered for Outright Monetary Transactions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Such a programme must entail conditionality that ensures fiscal discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.17,0)">With fiscal discipline, monetary policy cannot become captured by fiscal dominance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">And therefore, the central bank can continue its pursuit of safeguarding price stability in full independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">And there is one more important lesson from 2012 that we must keep in mind: measures to stabilise the euro area, particularly the OMTs, are not only essential for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">They also reduce Target2 balances and, because they foster the cohesion of the euro area, they reduce possible risks for German taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">To sum up, the facts support an ultimately more confident review of 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Prospects for 2013 As regards the coming year, I would like to suggest three things we need to focus on in 2013: First of all, we need perseverance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Despite the good progress so far showing that adjustment is happening, reform efforts need to be sustained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.57,0)">Adjustment is inherently difficult and will remain with us for some time to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Politicians and their populations will need to persevere, especially on structural reforms that improve competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Countries need competitiveness to sustain growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.58,0)">They must move away from debt-financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">There is no possibility of sustained growth based on permanent debt accumulation; and by the way, there is no social fairness based on permanent debt accumulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Second, we need continued ambition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Relative calm in financial markets should not lead to a lowering of our ambitions to fix the structural flaws in the governance framework of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">After the many advances that have been made in creating new rules and institutions, this coming year should focus on implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Third, we need patience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.21,0)">I am very well aware that for many people in the countries under adjustment, the personal economic situation can be very difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.79,0)">But there is simply no alternative to the path of reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.27,0)">The crisis has several facets that are of different importance in different countries: there is a debt crisis that needs fiscal consolidation; there is a competitiveness crisis that needs structural reforms; there is a banking crisis that needs a strong financial union; and there is a confidence crisis that needs strong commitment by all policy-makers, including by the central bank expressed through our programme of OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The social consensus behind the reforms will need to be maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">These reforms are not undertaken to please Brussels or Frankfurt or Washington but for the deep self-interest of the economies concerned and of the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">They will make the economies function better, more efficiently and, yes, also more fairly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Before drawing to a close, let me say a word on the prospective single supervisory mechanism and the role that the ECB shall take on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Later this year, once the legal texts have been adopted, the ECB will assume a major new responsibility to prepare for becoming the new euro area banking supervisor, as home and heart of the single supervisory mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.26,0)">This will be a major organisational challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Internal work is already underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">You can rest assured that we will work hard to ensure that the ECB will deliver on its responsibilities to the highest possible standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In the first press conference on this matter, when the single European supervisor had not yet been decided, I said that if it were to be the ECB, the following five principles would need to apply: the framework for supervision had to be effective and ensure coherent oversight; supervisory decision-making and monetary policy had to be clearly separated; national supervisors had to be properly involved through appropriate decentralisation; the Single Market had to be preserved for countries that did not join; and finally, there had to be full democratic accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, The establishment of the supervisory function in Frankfurt is a further tribute to the city as a financial centre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">The ECB will also continue to contribute to the cultural life of the city, not least through the ECB Cultural Days that we organise every year and which this year will focus on Latvia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">And in the eastern part of the city, we will see the Großmarkthalle emerge in its former glory together with our new tower that is scheduled for completion next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">We begin 2013 with more confidence than we had in January one year ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">This confidence is to a large extent built on the progress that all of us – governments, parliaments, the EU and the ECB – have been able to make during 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">But it is also crucially built on the expectation that progress will persist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The ECB for its part will be there to continue, as it has done successfully now for 14 years, to safeguard price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The Economist: “The World in 2012”, 16/11/2011  Walter Hallstein: “Wer in europäischen Dingen nicht an Wunder glaubt, ist kein
