    <h3> Speaker: Christian Noyer </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.11,0)"> Where are we 11 months before E-day?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Speech delivered by Christian Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of the Forum "Tremplin pour l'euro" in Courchevel, France, on 2 February 2001 Ladies and gentlemen, Just over two years ago, the European Union adopted its own single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Less than 11 months from today, we will be paying with euro banknotes and coins in our everyday transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">By many measures, this development could justifiably be considered an achievement of historic proportions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">With the arrival of euro banknotes and coins, the process of introducing a single European currency initiated in Maastricht in 1991 will finally be complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Today, the minds of European central bankers, the banking community and many other interested parties are certainly focused on the immense organisational and logistical task entailed by the cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Allow me nevertheless to briefly reflect on some of the developments that the euro has already triggered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">First of all, the irrevocable fixing of exchange rates between the participating currencies and the introduction of the euro on 1 January 1999 can rightly be considered as the "crowning" of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The euro is indeed "One money for one market", as the studies supporting the original Delors Report succinctly put it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The euro has undoubtedly become an important catalyst in promoting the further integration of product and capital markets of euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">More importantly, the policy-makers in the Member States have realised that being part of a monetary union will not only produce substantial economic benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.05,0)">It also imposes certain constraints on their own policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.12,0)">Rigidities in labour and product markets, inappropriate fiscal policies and fragmented regulatory frameworks all have a negative impact on the economic conditions, proper functioning and growth potential of the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Tackling these challenges has become a clear political priority over the last few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The ECB's success in maintaining price stability has certainly provided - and continues to provide - a crucial foundation for these efforts, by stabilising inflation expectations and instilling a "stability consensus" across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In this sense, the euro is one factor which is continuing to push euro area economies towards more balanced budgets and greater competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Another important aspect of the transformation of the European economy that has been stimulated by the advent of the single currency is the increasing financial integration within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Indeed, from the start, the prospect of deeper, wider and more integrated financial markets was among the most widely expected benefits of a common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This expectation is now being fulfilled, in some areas even more rapidly than initially anticipated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The euro-denominated commercial bond market, for example, has facilitated transactions of a size not witnessed in Europe before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The availability of financing in a larger and deeper market should help increase the competitiveness of the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This said, integration has proceeded at different speeds in the various segments of the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">From the ECB's point of view, we have noted with satisfaction that the money market in the euro area is now fully integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.58,0)">However, in other market segments, such as equity or securities markets, fragmentation of the legal framework and the lack of a truly pan-European perspective still hamper much-needed consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">It is encouraging to see that these deficiencies are being addressed as a matter of urgency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Efforts to harmonise national regulations and practices will help to cut costs and bring financial market conditions in Europe more closely into line with those prevailing in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.5,0)">It is unfortunate that these positive influences of the euro have gone largely unnoticed by the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Rather, it is the value of the euro on the foreign exchange market that has become the focus of most media attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.68,0)">The true, and altogether tangible, success of the euro - namely price stability throughout the euro area - has tended to be overlooked by many European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Instead, while the euro has largely been associated with the depreciation of its exchange rate, they have attributed the stable internal value of their currency to the inherent "quality" of the Deutsche Mark, French franc or guilder, which are still used for everyday transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">This, I am confident, is set to change with the introduction of our new currency in the form of banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The actual cash changeover is - as I am sure I do not need to tell you - an enormous challenge, not least because it needs to be accompanied by a generalised switchover to the euro as a unit of account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The success of this changeover will depend on all the actors involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This not only includes the ECB and national central banks, but also national administrations and the banking community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Moreover, the retail sector, the vending industry and the cash-in-transit companies, to mention just a few, have important roles to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.4,0)">Given the complexity of the task and the number of players involved, a centralised organisation of preparations would not have been feasible and was therefore ruled out from the start.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Rather, it was deemed appropriate to devolve responsibility for the organisation of the various contributions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This decentralised approach certainly has its advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">It allows, within the agreed overall framework, for tailor-made solutions specific to each national environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">At the same time, it makes a clear assignment of responsibilities particularly crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.92,0)">I will not go into detail as concerns the changeover to the euro as a unit of account, because the responsibility for this clearly lies with the governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.33,0)">But this does represent a large task since it concerns all public and private legal acts, administrations, companies and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Much responsibility therefore rests with the national administrations of the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">They have to create the conditions by, amongst other things, adapting relevant legislation and administrative procedures so that, in all respects, businesses, consumers and the public at large are ready and able to change over to the euro, including as regards the use of the new banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The European Commission and the Eurogroup are monitoring the state of these preparations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Nonetheless, the responsibility for implementation rests clearly with the Member States, which have set up comprehensive national changeover plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I might also mention that Member States' governments are also responsible for the minting of some 50 billion euro coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For its part, the Eurosystem has the task of producing the 14.5 billion euro banknotes and making them available to the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In addition to this, although not directly responsible, the ECB naturally attaches great importance to a smooth and well-prepared changeover in every aspect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">To this end, the ECB and the national central banks of the euro area have endorsed a number of general principles, concerning, for example, the frontloading and sub-frontloading of the euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Given the devolution of responsibilities for the cash changeover, such general principles are important to ensure a level playing-field and to avoid competitive distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Also important is the common schedule for the changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This sets specific dates for the various stages of the process, which need to be respected by all concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There are, of course, three important dates which I would like to briefly recall: The first of these is 1 September this year, the date on which each national central bank may begin "frontloading" euro banknotes and coins to credit institutions and other target groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.09,0)">However, this period can be shortened at the national level and may differ between target groups and between banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Then comes "E-day" - 1 January 2002 - the day on which the euro becomes legal tender and euro banknotes and coins will be made widely available to the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.34,0)">Finally, there is the end of the dual circulation period, when national banknotes and coins will cease to be legal tender.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.92,0)">This date varies from one Member State to another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">From 1 March 2002 onwards, however, the euro will be the sole legal tender in all euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The cash changeover will then be complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In most Member States, it is expected that the bulk of the cash changeover will take place in just one or two weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, I have talked so far about the responsibilities of the Eurosystem and the national administrations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">But you and I know that the banking community also bears a tremendous responsibility for ensuring a smooth cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Supplying the new euro banknotes in time to cash dispensers, storing and transporting large quantities of cash in a safe manner and sub-frontloading the euro banknotes and coins to retailers also imply considerable efforts by the banking community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Banks will also play a crucial role in informing and advising their customers, and in particular small businesses, about the measures that they need to take as a consequence of the changeover to the euro in cash form and as a unit of account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">May I say, I very much appreciate the efforts of the banking community, already undertaken and forthcoming, during this challenging period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">I also trust in your understanding of the historic dimension of this operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The long-term benefits of the euro far outweigh the one-off burden of the changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The successful completion of the process outlined thus far will be a major operation for banks, retailers, administrations and other parties involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">However, we should not forget that it also implies a significant change for the 300 million European citizens who will, thereafter, use the euro banknotes and coins for their daily transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">By then they must, for obvious reasons, be aware of their new currency's visual appearance and its security features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">To this end, the ECB and the national central banks, as well as the governments of the euro area Member States and the European institutions, have embarked on major information campaigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The ECB and the 12 national central banks of the euro area alone have earmarked EUR 80 million for their "Euro 2002 Information Campaign".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This Campaign focuses on four main themes: the visual appearance of the banknotes, their security features, their denominations and the common changeover modalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is designed to complement the other information campaigns on the euro, particularly those run by the national authorities in each euro area country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Naturally, and as I mentioned earlier, we are also relying on the efforts of the banking community in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.66,0)">At the end of the day, no television advertisement or billboard can replace the direct and immediate advice which competent bank employees can give to their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, roughly a year from now, we shall finally be using the new euro banknotes and coins and our national currencies will no longer be in circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, even then, the euro area will still not completely function as a truly unified currency zone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.13,0)">As I mentioned earlier, euro area financial markets are not yet fully integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">I would also like to draw your attention to another area, which directly concerns the banking community, and where the potential benefits of the euro have yet to be fully exploited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.96,0)">I am referring to the price differential that continues to exist between cross-border retail payments within the euro area and those within individual Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Like the cash changeover, this is another area where the banking community has a crucial role to play in securing the full benefits of the common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">I appreciate that this also represents a substantial task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">However, once European businesses and citizens are using the euro for their everyday transactions, the provision of low-cost, efficient cross-border retail payment services will undoubtedly become a clear policy priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Finally, returning to the title of my speech "Where are we 11 months before E-day?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">", I would say that so far we are well on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Even before the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, the euro has already delivered much of what was expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">We regard these achievements with some satisfaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Nonetheless, this does not mean that we are complacent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The enormous challenge of the cash changeover still has to be met and, despite all past and ongoing work, a lot remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.52,0)">Even after the changeover, the ECB does not anticipate settling down to "business as usual" anytime soon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Our objective is to make the euro a lasting success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">I am confident that - by also building on our good working relations with the banking community - we shall continue to succeed in this endeavour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Thank you ladies and gentlemen.</span>
