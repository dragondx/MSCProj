    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.59,0)"> Banking supervision - What next?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.72,0)">Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Banking Supervision, Resolution and Risk Management Conference during 20th Euro Finance Week, Frankfurt, Germany, 14 November 2017 “What next in banking supervision and resolution?” is the title of this panel discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Well, before we discuss what comes next, let us take a quick look at what has happened in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Since 2014, we have built European banking supervision from scratch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">We have hired people, devised methods and set up processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">There are certainly still things that need to be improved, but by and large the system runs smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As that is the case, there will be less construction work to be done in the years ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.9,0)">But this doesn’t mean that we will sit idly by, quite the opposite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The banking sector is facing a whole range of challenges, as you well know, and we have our part to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.16,0)">Let me mention a few points – and it’s not a comprehensive list.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">There is the banks’ search for profitability and their need to cut costs and adjust their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.2,0)">There is Brexit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.69,0)">There is digitalisation and there are cyber risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">There are the Basel III reforms, which need to be finalised and then implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">And there are efforts to further strengthen proportionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I could go on, but allow me to focus on just one of the core topics which the banks – and we – have to deal with: non-performing loans, NPLs for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.68,0)">Most NPLs are legacy issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">European banking supervision has, so to speak, inherited them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.27,0)">It’s a major problem that we have to tackle – or rather, the affected banks have to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.39,0)">For them, the non-performing loans weigh on profits; they require provisioning, and they are a constant drain on banks’ human resources, which could be put to more profitable use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.46,0)">And NPLs undermine trust – to what extent do markets trust a bank with a balance sheet that is considerably impacted by NPLs?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.53,0)">In other words, non-performing loans make the affected banks weaker and keep them from lending to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Banks which manage to forcefully address this legacy can focus on the future and attract new investors and new business, instead of forever having to look to the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">These banks can do their job: finance the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.36,0)">That makes it imperative to sort out NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">And there has been quite some progress on this front.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.33,0)">Since 2015, significant banks in the euro area have brought down their non-performing loans by almost €200 billion; from €989 billion to €795 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.03,0)">That said, NPLs are still too high in parts of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.48,0)">That is why banks have to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.18,0)">And times could not be better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">We can look back at 18 consecutive quarters of economic growth; this is a robust, broad-based economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.61,0)">Now is the time to sort out the issue of non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Banks need ambitious yet realistic plans to deal with their stocks of NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">And they need the right governance for these plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Earlier this year, the ECB published its “Guidance to banks on non-performing loans”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Along these lines, and as part of our supervisory dialogue, we take a close look at the banks’ ability to manage their NPL stocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.45,0)">We then scrutinise the plans devised by the banks to reduce those stocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We will start providing our feedback later this month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.13,0)">Banks have to carefully consider how they will react should any performing loans happen to become non-performing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">So, with the future in mind, we have to ensure that the problem of NPLs does not recur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">New NPLs should therefore be conservatively provisioned within a reasonable period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">This would serve to strengthen the balance sheets of banks, enabling them to focus on their core business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">That’s why we have drafted an addendum to our guidance on non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It sets out how we expect banks to provision for future NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The main goal is to have timely provisioning, which should prevent new NPLs from becoming a problem with systemic implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But let me say that while our expectations are firm, there are no automatic actions attached to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.3,0)">We will discuss with each affected bank individually why it is not fully provisioning for loans which have been non-performing for several years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Only if the results of this structured dialogue do not convince us will we consider Pillar 2 measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We have followed this path before, for instance with our recommendation on dividend distribution policies and the Asset Quality Review .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The addendum to our guidance on non-performing loans explains our methodology and is currently the subject of a public consultation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This consultation will increase transparency for banks, and the public, and it will help to ensure a level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">So, while it is ultimately up to the banks to deal with NPLs, we supervisors play a role too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It’s our job to address vulnerabilities in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.18,0)">NPLs are probably the single biggest challenge – and of course they are a drag on the entire economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">And while I am convinced that the ECB has led the way with its work on NPLs, we are not the only ones who can and should take action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">European finance ministers agreed, in July this year, on an action plan to tackle NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Also, national governments can help to resolve the NPL problem by reforming their legal and judicial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.7,0)">In some countries, it can take quite a long time to recover NPLs in court.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.91,0)">This is something that can only be addressed at national level by national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">NPLs are a joint problem, and we need to make a joint effort to resolve it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.35,0)">Each party has to play a role: banks, supervisors and politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">In line with our mandate, we supervisors have done and will continue to do what is necessary.</span>
