    <span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)"> Central banks, liquidity and a changing financial market infrastructure Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBJoint Banque de France / European Central Bank conference on “Liquidity in interdependent transfer systems”Paris, 9-10 June 2008 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, I am very pleased to welcome you to this conference and I am grateful that I can do so also in the name of the Banque de France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Last week we celebrated the 10th anniversary of the ECB and the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Building on the expertise and reputation of the national central banks of the euro area, the ECB has developed well and we are very proud that the Eurosystem as a team has delivered what we were supposed to: we have achieved our main objective of price stability in the euro area and – more closely linked to this conference – the smooth operation of payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.83,0)">Given the fast pace of financial markets today, I often feel that the ECB has been around for ages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.13,0)">When I look around this beautiful Galerie Dorée, however, I feel that the ECB is still a very young institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">What I find reassuring is the fact that the euro represents a tangible, perhaps the most tangible, realisation of something that is even older than our conference venue: the idea of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Please allow me to quote Jean Monnet: “Lorsqu’une idée correspond à la nécessité de l’époque, elle cesse d’appartenir aux hommes qui l’ont inventée et elle est plus forte que ceux qui en ont la charge.”   The well-being of Europe is closely linked to its economic prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Economic well-being, in turn, depends crucially on a functioning financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">I would like to take the opportunity of opening this conference to reflect on the more long-term trends in the financial sector with a special focus on liquidity in the context of market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">I will derive challenges from these trends that I think are particularly relevant for transfer systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Finally, I will point out where I see the necessary and adequate responses of the private and public sector to these challenges, in particular the Eurosystem’s contribution to an efficient and safe infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.53,0)">Different perspectives of liquidity Let me begin with a short reflection on liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.19,0)">If we lived in a world with perfect and complete markets as envisaged by Arrow and Debreu, liquidity problems would not exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Everybody would be able to make fully contingent arrangements to insure against unanticipated short-term needs for funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.11,0)">Well, the recent financial turmoil has painfully reminded us that financial markets do not match the theoretical ideal world of the “Arrow-Debreu” model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.22,0)">What do we then mean when we speak of liquidity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In general, we can distinguish between at least three types of liquidity  : First, monetary or macroeconomic liquidity refers to a generally accepted medium of exchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.76,0)">Such liquidity comprises central bank money and more broadly defined monetary aggregates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Second, market liquidity means the ability to trade an asset quickly and at low costs with little impact on its price  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">A third concept is funding liquidity, which means the ease of firms, households or banks to meet their respective payment obligations with internal or external funds as they fall due.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">All these concepts are – of course – closely interrelated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.01,0)">Deviations from expected developments in any of these areas can cause severe disruptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.17,0)">This is the essence of liquidity risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.37,0)">In the context of transfer systems, which are the focus of my speech today, liquidity risk is defined as the risk that a counterparty or a participant in a payment or settlement system will not settle an obligation at its full value when due  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.36,0)">For example, the operational failure of a major institution in a real-time gross settlement   system can turn it into a “liquidity sink”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.77,0)">This would have a negative external effect on the liquidity positions of other banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.98,0)">Liquidity risks could thus turn into a systemic risk when disruptions would spread across the financial system  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Overall, liquidity risk is a crucial feature of the financial sector in general and market infrastructure in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This is ably illustrated by an interesting special issue of the Banque de France’s Financial Stability Report that focuses on liquidity  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.23,0)">Trends in the financial sector Let me take a step back now and look at some long-term trends in the financial sector that have had an impact on liquidity management and market infrastructures  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">First, the financial sector has experienced a tremendous amount of technological and financial innovations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">For example, real-time gross settlement systems with electronic book-entries have become state-of-the-art.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Such RTGS systems reduce credit risk exposure in settlement, whilst increasing the demand for intraday liquidity and collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Financial innovation has also triggered a significant rise in the number of derivatives and the associated trading volume, not least on over-the-counter derivatives markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Second, financial globalisation has become manifest in the amount of cross-border financial flows and cross-border banking, but it goes much further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The increased global integration has strengthened the natural tendency towards concentrated provision of infrastructural services, a tendency that is further accentuated in the context of the European single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This third trend of increased concentration has not been limited to market infrastructures themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The emergence of key global players in banking has also led to increased internalisation of payment flows in correspondent banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Correspondent banks perform payment and custody services for other banks and have in some cases reached a similar size to some national payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.03,0)">Thus, correspondent banking begins to blur the distinction between intermediaries and infrastructure providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Speaking of concentration, I would also like to mention networks of interoperable systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">They can be seen as intermediate steps towards concentration or as alternatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">All these developments have contributed to lower financing costs, new investment and business opportunities, and general welfare gains for all citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">At the same time, these trends have increased the relevance of market infrastructures and pose considerable challenges for liquidity managers and central bankers, at all their time horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">I want to stress here that market infrastructures have shown a considerable degree of resilience and functioned well during the recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">This is a great achievement that should not be taken for granted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">However, some of the trends that I have mentioned have also played a prominent role during the recent financial turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.41,0)">Thus, there is no reason to be complacent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Challenges resulting from these trends I see three challenges, especially from the perspective of market infrastructures, resulting from these trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">These are: growing interdependencies; the potential emergence of a global monopoly; and the need for well-functioning financial and political structures at the supranational level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Let me first focus on increased interdependencies created by financial globalisation in conjunction with the other trends that I have just mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The significant benefits of financial globalisation come at the cost of a more complex global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Previously, settlement flows, operational processes and risk management procedures could be considered largely from a national or even more a system-, institution- or market-specific perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Today, the various transfer systems, financial institutions and markets have become highly interdependent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This can be positive when the associated network effects improve the safety and efficiency of payment and settlement processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.28,0)">However, it can also be negative when it allows an easier and quicker transmission of shocks and financial disruptions, sometimes in indirect, complex ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.68,0)">The financial turmoil has once again highlighted how negative developments in one market segment can abruptly spill over to other, seemingly unrelated, segments of the financial sector and across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.84,0)">One cause of the severity of the turbulence is that financial institutions had not sufficiently foreseen that liquidity can dry up in certain markets very quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.94,0)">Negative effects can be exacerbated if banks do not have access to sufficient collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The interdependencies of payment and settlement systems are very well described by a recently released Committee on Payment and Settlement Systems   report that I will refer to again when discussing the appropriate responses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.51,0)">A second challenge arises from the potential emergence of a global monopoly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Economies of scale and network effects are prominent in fixed-cost-dominated infrastructure services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This has given rise to the rather utopian idea of a single integrated market infrastructure covering the whole world as the end-game of the process of financial globalisation and concentration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.14,0)">At the same time, a global monopoly might lead to a single point of failure and other economic costs associated with monopolies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">However, it is not obvious that the alternative to a monopoly – that is, networks of interoperable systems – is superior.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">For example, are a small number of interoperable systems really less risky than a single system?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.26,0)">A third challenge that I would like to highlight today concerns the difficulties in establishing a well-functioning financial and political structure at the supranational level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.7,0)">This challenge reflects the general change of perspective on the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Over long periods, mature and often efficient financial structures had emerged on a national level, protected by – to a large extent appropriate – regulation, supervision and oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">National financial communities had developed a certain degree of trust, transparency and cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Today, the perspective has changed from the national to the international level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.29,0)">However, we frequently face a geographical and legal separation between the entities in charge of the oversight of the system, relevant banking supervisors and the entity providing liquidity to the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">An important thing that the financial turmoil has demonstrated is that national degrees of trust, transparency and cooperation have not yet been replicated on an international, global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This includes the existence of appropriate supervisory structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Overall, we face the challenge to create the same seamlessly functioning financial system and market infrastructures on a supranational level that we have already today at national levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Adequate responses to these challenges It is very important to find adequate responses to these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.95,0)">This duty – for the sake of economic prosperity – falls to all of us, the private sector as well as public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Let me begin with some responsibilities of the private sector because, I believe, we should rely on market solutions as much as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Financial market participants need to take into account the increased interdependencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">As clearly described in the CPSS report, they need to adopt a holistic approach to risk management, in particular as banks have increasingly relied on wholesale and secured funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And they need to focus on liquidity and operational risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">I have the impression that the private sector is aware of this challenge and is preparing the necessary response, as evident from the initiatives of the Institute of International Finance, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Various committees, both at the international and the EU level, are assisting the private sector in its work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Now, it is necessary to not lose momentum and to implement the proposed holistic approach to risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.01,0)">This means that systems and institutions need to look beyond their own operations and direct exposures to understand the broad range of disruptions that might affect them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">This is most important for infrastructure and service providers as well as for financial institutions that have a critical role in the global infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.87,0)">The trend towards concentration represents the second, more long-term challenge that I have mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">I think that it makes a lot of sense to complement the European Monetary Union with harmonised and efficient market infrastructures in certain areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">However, I do not expect the utopian idea of a single, globally integrated infrastructure to become reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Technological and financial innovation provides limits to concentration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">New ideas, the exploitation of market niches and regulatory changes that promote competition will allow platforms to continue to have competitive advantages in some specialised areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">It is crucial that these platforms will be transparent, provide open access to potential users and enable interoperability with other platforms in order to reap the full benefits of financial globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">But as interoperability requires competitors to cooperate, I am aware that achieving sustainable and efficient solutions is not always easy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Finally, let me mention one particular point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">As recently recommended by the Financial Stability Forum  , market participants should make further efforts to ensure that the settlement, legal and operational infrastructure underlying over-the-counter derivatives markets is sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I know that also the CPSS closely monitors developments in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let me now turn to the responsibilities of public authorities Just like the market, they need to take into account the increased interdependencies, concentration and required international perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Being a central banker, I think it is my task to focus on the various roles of a central bank as a liquidity provider, service provider, catalyst and overseer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The relevance of collateral for liquidity issues has been clearly recognised by central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">During the past ten years, central banks have – especially in the context of the CPSS and other Basel committees – focused jointly their attention on the use of collateral in financial transactions, including the cross-border use of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Cooperation in this respect is very useful and, especially for emergency situations, I would think that central banks – by enabling the cross-border use of collateral – could make a positive contribution to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">As a service provider, the Eurosystem has demonstrated with the successful launch of the large-value payment system TARGET2 that it can deliver state-of-the-art infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">TARGET2 is the biggest RTGS   system and settles more than 350,000 transactions worth around €2.5 trillion every day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">We in the Eurosystem have also worked a lot together with market participants on two other building blocks of a single European market infrastructure: TARGET2-Securities  , a single settlement platform for securities, and CCBM2, a harmonised solution for collateral management within the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In today’s world, the availability of collateral has become the binding constraint for intraday liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Hence, it is extremely important to be able to move collateral quickly and safely across financial systems, borders and currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">TARGET2, T2S and CCBM2 are three complementary and mutually beneficial services of the Eurosystem for this purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In a recent ECB survey, banks have reported minimum annual savings of €53 million in liquidity and collateral management alone from T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Based on the figures from market participants, the very conservatively estimated benefits of T2S for direct users of T2S are at least €145 million per year in the baseline scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">For the European economy as a whole, we can anticipate dynamic benefits from T2S exceeding one billion euro per year  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">In addition, TARGET2 and T2S make use of counterparty risk-free central bank money for settlement, a feature that has become even more beneficial in light of the financial turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The Eurosystem has acted as a catalyst for another building block for an integrated European market infrastructure, the Single Euro Payments Area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">The same holds true for the interoperability of existing systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">As specialised infrastructures are likely to remain, the relevance of interoperability between different systems stays at the top of the agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.6,0)">Oversight is the third role of central banks in payment and settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In general, market infrastructures have performed well during the financial turmoil, owing largely to effective capacity planning by service providers enabling them to handle recent peaks in volatility and trading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Overseers have to continue to monitor the safety and efficiency of individual payment and settlement “critical” infrastructure, as well as the safety of the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">To achieve this, the increased interdependence requires an international perspective to oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Overseers need to cooperate and to show a certain degree of convergence in order to avoid regulatory arbitrage and a “race to the bottom” of regulatory standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">I think that we have some scope for improvement on this dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Increased interdependence also calls for a second dimension of cooperation, namely between oversight of market infrastructures and banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">For example, correspondent banks appear to provide substantial non-collateralised intraday credits to their clients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.57,0)">Traditional capital requirements, however, do not focus on the intraday liquidity aspects and on possible exposures during the day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Hence, it is crucial to ensure an adequate surveillance of these intraday risk exposures and the evolution of liquidity and collateral management at both system level and bank level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Recent work at the Bank for International Settlements and within the Eurosystem demonstrates that public authorities have recognised this necessity and started to address it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The ECB is strongly supportive of the various initiatives at the EU and global level and will contribute to the pertinent work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">I firmly believe that the international cooperation among public authorities will continue to foster financial integration, development and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.68,0)">Conclusion Let me now briefly conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">The financial turmoil has once again demonstrated that liquidity should not be taken for granted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I have highlighted a number of more long-term financial sector trends that have had an impact on liquidity management and market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Altogether, they result in new challenges from increased interdependencies, consolidation and the required international perspective on seamlessly functioning financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The private sector and public authorities, both in their own responsibilities and in joint efforts, need to continue to address these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">We have made considerable progress in our understanding of the relevant issues and the necessary policy conclusions, as evident from the various initiatives that I mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Financial market infrastructure is in evolution; its improvement remains an ongoing challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">This conference hosts a number of papers and panel sessions that serve as further examples of how we are improving our understanding of liquidity and interdependent transfer systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">I am looking forward to interesting insights and stimulating discussions that will no doubt be inspired by the outstanding surroundings here in the Galerie Dorée.</span><span
