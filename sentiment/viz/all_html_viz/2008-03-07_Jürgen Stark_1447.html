    <span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)"> Contribution to the session on “Implications for the conduct of monetary policy” Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat International Symposium on“Globalisation, Inflation and Monetary Policy”organised by the Banque de France Paris, 7 March 2008 John Taylor has discussed a number of challenges to monetary policy-making in an era of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In my remarks, I will focus on the implications of globalisation specifically for monetary policy-making in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Globalisation may change the environment for monetary policy-making We all agree that globalisation offers great opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">It increases the scope for efficiency gains through specialisation since it allows economies to make better use of their comparative advantage in international production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This reduces production costs and expands the production frontier, generating gains which are passed on to consumers through lower prices for many goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Globalisation thus fosters economic prosperity and raises living standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At the same time, the gains from globalisation may not be distributed evenly, as globalisation can affect differently the returns to different factors of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.41,0)">To monetary policy-makers, globalisation is important mainly for two reasons: First, the process of globalisation itself can occasionally lead to economic disruptions, especially if markets lack transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.77,0)">Increasingly-globalised and internationally-integrated financial markets, for example, if not sufficiently transparent, can at times be conducive to excessive risk-taking and contagion effects – a theme that rings particularly true in light of the current financial turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Second, and more importantly, increasing global integration induces structural changes in goods markets and financial markets alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.85,0)">As a result, foreign shocks may have a greater impact on domestic inflation, and the transmission of other impulses to the euro area economy can change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.18,0)">This also applies to the impact of monetary policy on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.88,0)">Let me briefly elaborate on how structural changes, which are driven by globalisation, can affect the process of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">There is good reason, for instance, to believe that globalisation increases competitive pressures, both worldwide and in domestic markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.89,0)">An increase in competition may – relative to previous periods – put downward pressure on wages and prices and thus contain inflation for a period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">A structural intensification of competition would also induce firms to work harder to increase productivity, and this would translate into an increase in the growth rate of the natural level of output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.3,0)">Beyond this effect, the increasing use of international production opportunities based on comparative advantage may lead to a change in the production structure of our economy, which would in turn alter the relative scarcity of production factors, and thus the response of their prices and the prices of final goods to economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Thus, globalisation is of importance to monetary policy and it is likely to have a lasting effect on our economy and on the environment for monetary policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">An initial conclusion therefore is that central banks need to continue to commit resources to analyse and closely monitor the structural changes and the shocks caused by globalisation, and need to build an increasing awareness of economic and financial developments outside their home countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Globalisation does not change rules of monetary policy-making Although globalisation is challenging monetary policy, I fully agree with John Taylor’s assessment that globalisation does not fundamentally alter the rules for monetary policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.68,0)">Nowadays as ever, over the medium to longer term, inflation is a monetary phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">This means price stability is for us to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.82,0)">Let me stress the obvious here, namely that central banks cannot permanently determine the relative prices of specific goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In referring to price stability, we mean stability of the purchasing power   as measured by the cost of a representative basket of goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">While international liquidity conditions may influence market interest rates and thus the transmission of monetary policy to real activity and inflation, central banks retain the ability to control short-term interest rates by appropriately influencing the supply of the domestic legal tender.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Short-term rates in turn work their way into the domestic cost of credit and into long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Therefore, central banks can ensure price stability in the medium to long-term, even in a financially-integrated world in which production factors and goods move freely, and even if the size of the world economy increases relative to that of the domestic economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">But, as I said earlier, as a precondition for successful monetary policy central banks need to properly adapt their analyses to the changing environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In such an environment, it is clearly important for stability-orientated monetary policy to analyse developments in external prices, in international trade flows and in international financial flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This said, I agree with John Taylor that developments in exchange rates per se should not be given any special status but should be taken into account by monetary policy only to the extent that they have a medium-term influence on price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This is because another fundamental law of monetary economics is alive and well in the globalised economy: flexible exchange rates are a sine qua non for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Does a globalised world call for more international monetary coordination?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">With a growing set of prices and asset valuations being determined internationally, information on international developments is crucial for monetary policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">In this light, the financial turmoil in particular has shown the value that growing financial globalisation places on a timely and open international exchange of information among central banks and regulators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Central banks should therefore cooperate by exchanging information and by designing a solid international financial architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Beyond that, however, the scope for monetary policy-makers to coordinate is limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This is the case as each central bank has just one policy instrument, and this instrument can only achieve a single domestic objective, price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">As a consequence, each central bank is well advised to react to foreign developments only if these become relevant for domestic price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I therefore fully agree with John Taylor’s conclusion that central banks should not mechanically follow other central banks’ policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Not least as a result of this consensus, I question the strong conclusions that John Taylor draws from some of his empirical analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">In brief, John Taylor finds that a simple monetary policy rule, also widely referred to as the “Taylor rule”, when applied to the euro area, has residuals that correlate positively with the US federal funds rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.51,0)">He interprets this finding as implying a leader-follower structure in the sense that US monetary policy induces the ECB to deviate from its objective of price stability out of concern for the exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.57,0)">This is not the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Indeed, a more reasonable explanation for John Taylor’s findings is the following: Central banks which are concerned with domestic price stability seek to offset potentially destabilising shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In a globalised world, though, different central banks naturally respond in part to similar global factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And, as we know, a number of these factors are not well captured by a mechanical policy rule of the type which John Taylor takes as a benchmark for good monetary policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Adequate policy reactions to global factors, and to the risks that they pose for domestic price stability, will thus show up – within the context of a simple rule – in the residual term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Some observers, John Taylor included, interpret this residual as a measure of the monetary stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It may indeed, in some cases, be possible to interpret the residual in this way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.96,0)">However, often the residual is a measure of the lack of explanatory power of the simple policy rule itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.13,0)">Now, to the extent that economies are structurally different and are hit by shocks with different timings, global factors affect these economies with different lags.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.91,0)">As a result, the measures of inflation and the output gap used in John Taylor’s policy rule are also affected with different lags.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In such a context, monetary policy has to react in a pre-emptive manner to current and future likely developments to ensure domestic price stability over the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.07,0)">However, such a behaviour might generate a spurious correlation between the residuals of a simple Taylor type policy rule for the euro area and interest rates in other economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.38,0)">I suspect that this is what lies behind John Taylor’s result concerning the deviations from a euro area “policy rule” and the US federal funds rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Having inside knowledge, I can in fact rule out that John Taylor’s results constitute any sign of a leader-follower structure or any sign of a focus on the side of the ECB on the dollar-euro exchange rate, or in fact on any exchange rate, as a target of policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.71,0)">Neither is the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.1,0)">I agree with John Taylor, however, that any development in that direction would be deeply worrying.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Only a clear assignment of responsibilities ensures clarity about the central bank’s objective, which is at the heart of successful monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Yet international complementarities exist in monetary policymaking, to the extent that an international architecture which has each central bank keeping its own house in order is also conducive to an environment of global monetary stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Such architecture provides the best basis for a friendly and open exchange of views and information at an international level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Today there is frequent interaction as, for example, the BIS provides a much-appreciated forum for discussion among central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">In addition, there are further occasions for fruitful exchanges – this very symposium being one of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The role of the monetary policy strategy in an increasingly globalised world I have argued that the best international monetary architecture is one in which each central bank focuses on achieving domestic price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">In practice, even more is needed to guarantee a successful monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">A clear mandate for price stability and a well-defined monetary policy strategy based on this mandate are essential for coping successfully with the analytical and practical challenges which lie ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Fortunately, both conditions are in place in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">A clear mandate for price stability ensures that a central bank is fully accountable for achieving price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The commitment to price stability which such a mandate generates is, in turn, conducive to anchoring private sector expectations in a lasting way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This anchoring is particularly important if globalisation causes sequences of one-sided shocks to inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">prevents central bank policy from going astray.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">While John Taylor expresses concerns that central banks may be increasingly tempted to stabilise exchange rates at the expense of price stability, a clear mandate for price stability guarantees that a central bank will not fall into this trap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.93,0)">Instead price stability-orientated central banks do not assign any special role to exchange rates, important as they are as information variables in the economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Building on a clear mandate, a successful strategy supports accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">ensures a transparent and systematic response to risks to price stability guides an effective communication policy, and enhances the predictability of monetary policy over the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In this context, any measure of price stability used by central banks must adequately reflect the evolution of the purchasing power of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.71,0)">Price stability is therefore best defined in terms of the cost of a representative, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">broad, basket of goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">An example which provides a clear and assessable yardstick of price stability is the basket underlying the euro area Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.67,0)">This encompassing definition of the underlying basket contrasts with partial, or so-called “core” measures of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.67,0)">While these measures can be useful for assessing risks to price stability, they – if put front and centre – risk providing a distorted view of underlying price developments which would jeopardise the anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.44,0)">This would be particularly detrimental in situations in which globalisation might induce sustained movements of prices of certain categories of goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">A broad, transparent and widely accepted yardstick instead creates the necessary clarity to ensure a firm anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">It is this clarity which allows a central bank to adopt a medium-term orientation within which policy-makers can appropriately discount short-term price volatility and transitory movements in inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.41,0)">As mentioned, globalisation is likely to change the structure of the euro area economy both with regard to goods markets and financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">A strategy which monitors structural changes both from a goods market angle and from a financial or monetary point of view is therefore well-suited to cope with the challenges brought about by globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">The complementary perspectives of the economic analysis and the monetary analysis, which underlie the ECB’s “two-pillar strategy”, are conducive to appropriately adapting our policies to the changing environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">At the same time, the two-pillar strategy keeps minds focused on the fundamental laws of monetary economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In particular, having an explicit monetary pillar guarantees that the ECB always has considerable expertise in the analysis of monetary and credit developments and in the analysis of their impact on price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">The close link between monetary developments and evolving imbalances in asset and credit markets implies that monetary analysis enables central banks to detect such imbalances at an early stage and to respond to the implied risks to price and financial stability in a timely and forward-looking manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">This has, in the past, proved an invaluable asset for the ECB, notably in times of global financial turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Just as the two-pillar strategy structures the discussion within the ECB, it also provides the basis for communicating our understanding of the economy to the outside world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">By adhering to transparency, the ECB has achieved a high level of predictability for its monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Our strategy therefore improves our policy effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">Especially in an environment of ongoing globalisation, monetary policy must aim to robustly anchor inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This requires a permanent alertness to risks to price stability on the side of the central bank, as shocks to inflation must not translate into second-round effects in price-setting and wage-setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">That being said, an efficient adjustment of the economy to macroeconomic shocks can be best facilitated by monetary policy-makers if they keep a firm focus on their domestic price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In particular, there will be no external stability without domestic price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Domestic price stability is a precondition for global monetary stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Globalisation therefore does not expand the need for international monetary co-operation beyond an open exchange of views and information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The best international architecture is one in which each central bank has a clear mandate to focus on domestic price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Greater microeconomic flexibility would not only allow our economy to take better advantage of the opportunities provided by globalisation, but would also facilitate macroeconomic adjustment in the wake of shocks and improve the resilience of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Globalisation therefore intensifies the need for more flexibility in product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">I have argued that a monetary policy strategy which carefully monitors developments in domestic, as well as international, financial and goods markets is well-equipped to cope with challenges that globalisation brings for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Such a strategy is in place in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">At the same time, price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make to enable the euro area economy to take the full advantage of the opportunities offered by globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.75,0)">For stylised facts about trade globalisation and its likely effects on euro area inflation, see also the ECB Monthly Bulletin article entitled “Globalisation, trade and the euro area macroeconomy”,  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Trade theory   would e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.01,0)">suggest that trade integration should place downward pressures on the relative return to lower-skilled labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">However, real wage developments have been similar across all skill groups in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">That is, it would lead to an increase in the rate at which the economy can grow without jeopardising price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">g., M.
