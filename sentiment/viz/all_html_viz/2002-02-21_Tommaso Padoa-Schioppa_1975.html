    <span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)"> Securities and banking: bridges and walls London School of Economics: Securities and banking: bridges and wallsLecture by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa,Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank TABLE OF CONTENTS INTRODUCTION 1 CHANGES 2 RISKS 8 REGULATION 13 CONCLUSION 19 I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">INTRODUCTION I once again find myself speaking at the London School of Economics after a milestone has been reached in European monetary unification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.32,0)">Last time, I was here in February 1999, just a few weeks after the launch of the common currency, at the start of the single monetary policy and the disappearance of intra-euro area exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">This time, we have recently accomplished the provision of over 300 million people with new banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Three years ago, I talked in this forum about an important new feature brought about by the euro - the break-up of the overlap between the jurisdictions of monetary policy and financial supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">In this context, I highlighted the need to step up co-operation in banking supervision to meet the challenges arising from this unusual architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This evening, I would like to focus on another theme: the relationship between banking and securities activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Whereas this relationship has mainly been seen in terms of separation   since the 1930s, I intend to examine the extent to which links   have developed between the two activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This topic is of interest because we have witnessed the increasing role of securities markets everywhere in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">This process has triggered increasing links between banking and securities activities and has had relevant implications for the risk profile of individual financial institutions and the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.48,0)">Consequently, new policy issues have arisen with regard to the regulatory and supervisory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In Europe these developments have been accentuated by the advent of the euro, and policy­ makers have paid special attention to it, as reflected in the work of the Economic and Financial Committee and the Committee of Wise Men.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For the sake of clarity, I should first like to define the notions of banking and securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.48,0)">As we know, only a specific legal type of financial institution - a bank - is allowed to conduct the essence of banking business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.73,0)">Accordingly, banks are defined in basically all jurisdictions as institutions granting loans on their own account and collecting deposits from the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.58,0)">As regards securities firms, they include a variety of institutions, which do not conduct the core "loan-deposit" banking business nor sell insurance products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.47,0)">They can be, inter alia, investment funds, investment banks, broker-dealers and financial advisers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Whereas the notion of the essence of banking is common to virtually all national jurisdictions, differences were more pronounced until recently in the scope of other financial activities allowed to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.81,0)">In the United States and Japan - which for many decades had required a strict separation of banking and securities activities - a combination of the two activities was permitted by the end of the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In the EU, "universal banking" has long allowed securities businesses to be conducted by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.04,0)">My remarks are organised as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will start by examining relevant structural changes in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">After that, I will turn to the issue of which risks to individual institutions and the whole financial system travel on the bridges that have recently been constructed by market developments between banking and securities activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Finally, I will address the main implications of the banking-securities combination for the regulatory and supervisory arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Before starting, I would like to note - and I will justify this later on - that I do not consider it desirable to abandon the distinction between banks and non-bank financial institutions as regards access to the public safety net.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.95,0)">My remarks should also not be interpreted as implying that financial stability considerations should normally influence monetary policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The ECB is focused on maintaining price stability and neither the Treaty allows it nor is it inclined by its own convictions to change its focus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">CHANGES Let me consider first the developments in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Following the increased size and sophistication of securities markets, structural changes have progressively occurred on a global basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Profound changes have also occurred in bank-dominated continental Europe, especially since the boost provided by the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I shall review five changes which can be seen as particularly relevant: securitisation, institutionalisation of investment, emergence of complex financial instruments, conglomeration, and consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.37,0)">Securitisation refers to the shift in the financial system away from the dominance of non-marketable instruments   to marketable securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">On the demand side, this trend has been generated by the substantial increase in financial wealth held by households - itself a result of our societies becoming increasingly affluent - and the development of voluntary long-term saving to supplement public pension schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">On the supply side, the increasing use of securities market funding by firms has been related to obtaining more competitive interest rates and diversifying debt structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The rapid pace of securitisation is particularly striking in Europe, where bank deposits and public pension schemes used to be dominant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">In the euro area, the share of direct or indirect securities holdings in households' assets is now considerably above the share of deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The stock market capitalisation of euro area listed companies is now above 100 per cent of GDP, up from just 30 per cent in 1995.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">This figure is affected by stock price changes, but a doubling in the number of listed companies since 1995 confirms an increased use of equity market finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">As for the bond markets, the annual growth rate of issuance by euro area non-financial firms has been well above 20 per cent over the past three to four years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The overall size of the debt market - including also previously predominant government and bank bonds - is now approaching the volume of bank credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">No doubt, the recourse to market-based finance in Europe is still significantly below that of the United States, but the gap is rapidly narrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This development has substantially increased the demand for investment banking services, where some major European banks now act as global investment banks, mainly competing with global players of US origin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.24,0)">In the past, there was - whether de jure as in "Glass Steagall countries" or de facto as in continental Europe - a kind of wall between banking and securities activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Indeed, banks used to channel funds from low or medium- wealth households to most firms, whereas only high-wealth households invested in securities by directly purchasing the equities or bonds only issued by the few largest firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Securitisation means that dealing in securities is now also recurrent among lower-wealth households and smaller and higher-risk firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">For example, the share of higher-risk bond issuers with less than an A-rating has increased to 25 per cent in 2000 from 10 in 1998 in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Similarly, in the euro area equity market, the number of listings of small growth companies increased ten-fold between 1998 and 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The second major trend - institutionalisation of investment - refers to the increased purchase of securities via collective investment vehicles, such as mutual funds, pension funds and life insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Rather than providing funds directly via the financial market, households invest in collective vehicles to obtain diversification benefits and thus higher expected returns, while keeping their risk levels acceptable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Wealthy households pursue the same objective also through private asset management services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The increased size and sophistication of financial markets have also made investing in collective vehicles relatively cheaper than entering into securities markets directly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Also this process has been very rapid in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">In most continental European countries, all types of collective investment have increased much faster than direct holdings of securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The total value of mutual funds has increased at the fastest rate by 25-fold since the early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The institutionalisation of investment has made the increased recourse to securities markets compatible with the preservation and expansion of the role of financial intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Notwithstanding increased competition from non-bank intermediaries, the importance of banks has not declined either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">This is clearly the case in Europe, where, in asset management services, European banks have been able to exploit their extensive retail distribution networks to reach ultimate investors, thus gaining a dominant position that in many EU countries goes beyond 80 per cent of total collective investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Major European banks redesigned their strategies as they saw higher profit margins and greater growth prospects in asset management and investment banking activities than in traditional banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Such strategies were successful in boosting non-interest income and profitability, also because of the boom in securities markets until mid-2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.69,0)">In 2000, non-interest income accounted for 52 per cent of EU banks' total net income, whereas it was less than 30 per cent in 1996.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">For major banks active in the securities field, the replacement of traditional interest income has gone much further - the share of non-interest income reaching in some cases 70 per cent of total income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">All in all, securities activities have become more important for many banks, either directly or via their subsidiaries, thereby establishing a strong bridge between banking and securities activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">The third structural change is the rapid growth in complex financial instruments designed to unbundle, trade and transfer risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Although the statistics available are somewhat unsystematic, it can be said that the global markets for complex instruments - which for a considerable part consist of OTC derivatives - have doubled in size several times in ten years or so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Whereas these instruments originally developed in the market risk area, they have been progressively extended to the field of credit risk as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This tendency is also clearly visible in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Among the instruments created to handle credit risk, I would first like to mention the repackaging of bank loans into marketable securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In addition to traditional mortgage loans, this technique now extends to loans to small and medium-sized enterprises and consumer credits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.13,0)">The recent products are such that investors no longer hold claim against the lending bank, as this can transfer completely the credit risk to other banks or other financial institutions such as insurance companies and investment funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Another important category of instruments to transfer credit risk consists of credit derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Although the market for these instruments is still small in comparison with more mature derivatives, it has greatly expanded in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The development of complex financial instruments is in line with the notion - once put forward by Robert Merton - according to which the existence of sophisticated securities markets allows financial institutions to replicate all traditional financial products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In terms of the bridges between banking and securities activities, there are two important aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.86,0)">One is that banks are losing their monopoly position over instruments involving credit risk, as credit risk can be traded and re-allocated to other financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The other is that the distinction between non-marketable loans and marketable securities tends to fade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.88,0)">Conglomeration is the fourth relevant change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.45,0)">It can be defined as conducting within one financial institution or group at least two of the three traditionally distinct activities of banking, securities and insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.71,0)">This general definition, however, could lead to different legal definitions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For instance, the planned EU Directive on financial conglomerates requires the presence of insurance to qualify a conglomerate, since the capital regulation for banks and securities firms is already laid down under a single framework by the Capital Adequacy Directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In the United States, on the other hand, the notion of financial conglomerate adopted by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 is that of a financial holding company, which can   offer the full range of financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Recently, the drift towards conglomeration has been quite strong in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the euro area, mergers and acquisitions across sectors have accounted for roughly 30 per cent of all financial industry deals in terms of value over the past five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Banks have increasingly merged with or acquired securities firms in order to take advantage of the developing securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Interestingly, new types of conglomerate structures have also emerged, such as the combination of banking activities and pension fund management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The traditional form of conglomeration, which was the setting-up of bank-insurance groups, has also continued to develop, driven by reforms in national pension systems as well as by synergies in the distribution of different financial products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The possibility of conglomeration gives financial institutions some latitude in choosing the corporate structure that suits them best.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Some banks - as in the universal banking model - choose to take advantage of their banking franchise and undertake securities activities in-house, while establishing adequate Chinese walls wherever necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Other banks choose to conduct securities businesses via a separate subsidiary to avoid any market presumption of conflicts of interest between banking and securities businesses, an issue to which I will return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Others go even further in the separation by creating a holding company and carrying out securities activities in a sister affiliate of a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In comparison with the alternative direct provision of securities services by banks, the latter two organisational forms might be used to convey the perception that a wall still exists between banking and securities activities, even though they are linked by intra-group bridges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The fifth and last trend I want to mention is consolidation, which consists in the establishment of large and complex financial institutions with sizeable market positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Consolidation is the outcome of mergers and acquisitions both within and across sectors of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The pace at which consolidation has moved has been high in recent times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Economies of scale related to wholesale trading, the processing of market information and the servicing of large institutional and corporate clients have increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.79,0)">Therefore, both banks and other financial institutions have been forced to expand in size to be able to conduct successful business activities in securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">These developments have been thoroughly documented and analysed in the report of the G10 group of central banks, co-ordinated by Roger Ferguson, the Vice- Chairman of the US Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">In Europe, the advent of the euro has triggered a particularly significant movement towards consolidation, as the segmentation of markets along the different currencies made it impossible to fully exploit the economies of scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The fact that 70 per cent of the value of all mergers of euro area financial institutions over the past ten years has taken place in the last three years illustrates how strong the impact of the euro has been.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Although most of the deals have been domestic, their motivation often reflected the need to operate effectively in more integrated securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Moreover, the share of cross- border mergers has been increasing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The consolidation of banks and securities firms into large and complex institutions has led to an increased concentration of wholesale trading activities into single entities, yet another development that cuts across the traditional boundaries of banking and securities products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">By contrast, in the retail financial sector, the market landscape is more diversified, with small banks and securities houses competing against the large financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.31,0)">10.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">All five structural changes I have briefly reviewed point to major bridges between banking and securities activities, which have been built in recent years in fundamental areas of financial activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me recap on these bridges in a nutshell.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Securitisation has extended the recourse to markets to individuals and firms, which previously resorted predominantly to banking services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Institutionalisation of investment has shifted the focus of banks beyond the traditional loan-deposit activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.34,0)">Complex risk transfer instruments have reduced the dominance of banks in the credit business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Conglomeration has led to the establishment of corporate structures, which bind together different financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Finally, consolidation has resulted in major market positions for large and complex financial institutions in several financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.64,0)">RISKS 11.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I would now like to turn to the implications of these market developments for the risks of individual intermediaries and the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">With regard to risks for individual banks, their participation in securities activity - stemming from the developments I just reviewed - changes the risks to which they are exposed, increasing the importance of some and reducing that of others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Market risks and income volatility risks have increased in importance, while credit and interest rate risks   may have declined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.16,0)">Market risks can arise in particular from banks' own proprietary trading activities supporting retail asset management and investment banking businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.94,0)">As for income volatility risks, these have already demonstrated their relevance, as the recent reduction in capital market activity has caused a significant drop in investment banking volumes and income for some of the major European banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">This change has to be balanced against the benefits from increased diversification, the gains from enhancing bank-customer relationships, and economies of scope in the production and distribution of financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Rather than even trying to strike any balance between the risks and benefits, I would like to flag the consequent changes in banks' risk profiles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">These are obviously relevant in the context of the regulatory and supervisory arrangements concerning the safety and soundness of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.63,0)">12.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The increased trading in complex financial instruments plays a particular role as it can substantially change the risk profile of the financial institutions participating in these markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">On the one hand, the development of risk transfer instruments is a positive evolution, since these instruments allow the best placed institution to take the risk from the originating entity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">On the other hand, these instruments also allow institutions to take large risk positions and to re-allocate them rapidly to third parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.09,0)">Because of these aspects, the transparency of markets and risk positions is reduced, and it may become hard for supervisors to monitor the risks run by individual institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Moreover, the concentration of the global activity in a few major intermediaries due to the consolidation process may lead to significant risk concentrations, which could be particularly important in OTC derivative instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">According to some estimates, the top three intermediaries can account for almost 30 per cent of the global activity in these contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">The trading in complex instruments increases the importance of adequate risk management at individual institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.0,0)">It should not be forgotten that the distinction between credit and market risk is, in economic terms, one of quantity, not of quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.73,0)">With the increased trading of marketable credit risk the distinction is further blurred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.22,0)">The size of the market risk exposure of any traded security or derivative instrument converges to the credit risk exposure - i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.16,0)">the full depletion of the investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Indeed, some financial institutions have already started to develop integrated approaches to the management of credit and market risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Quantitative tools are being expanded by many banks into the credit risk area as well - also because of the upcoming changes in bank capital regulation, which allow the use of banks' internal rating systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.42,0)">13.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.18,0)">Moving now to the consequences of the structural changes described before for overall financial stability, it has first to be observed that a crucial issue, on which reflection is called for, is the traditional assumption that possible disruptions to the financial system arise from banking but not from the securities field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This is the assumption behind the basic difference in the policy approaches   adopted respectively for banking and securities activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Whereas in the case of banking policy, it is centred on the pursuit of financial stability, in the case of securities it focuses on investor protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.57,0)">This difference in emphasis has been based on two main types of argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Firstly, financial stability concerns were not expected to arise when volumes involved in securities businesses were small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.32,0)">As we have seen, however, this argument has lost most of its validity in today's highly developed financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.86,0)">More fundamental is the second argument - a claim that by virtue of the nature of the business and not because of size, securities activities are not, in any case, a potential source of fragility for the financial system in the way in which banking is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Here, I would suggest that, in view of the important structural changes described before, the validity of this argument needs to be checked again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.34,0)">The fact that widespread financial crises have taken place in financial systems relying mainly on banking - such as in Scandinavia and Asia - has led a number of observers   to argue that one should rely more on securities markets than on banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.39,0)">However, opposing views have been expressed too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">For example, the Ferguson report on consolidation highlights the fact that sophisticated securities markets require the participation of ever-larger financial institutions and groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.28,0)">Risks to financial stability may be created if any of these institutions encounter serious problems and there is contagion to the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.43,0)">Academics   have also addressed this issue, although the main body of the literature available remains focused on refining theories on banking, or looks at the issue of contagion in world securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In order to explore the stability problems raised by securities activities one should first be somewhat more specific about the definition of systemic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Indeed there are, as you are well aware, various approaches to this notion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.22,0)">In my view, a correct definition ought not to refer to isolated individual failures, which should always be possible as a normal feature of any industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.85,0)">It should instead refer to widespread consequences through contagion in the whole financial system, such as those preventing the system from carrying out its core economic functions of channelling payments and allocating funds from savings to investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.37,0)">14.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.76,0)">The proposition that securities activities do not pose a threat to the stability of the financial system can, for the purpose of a discussion, be split into two parts, referring respectively to the risk of a run and to the risk of contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The first part of the proposition is thus that securities businesses, by dealing with liquid and marketable assets and liabilities, would be insulated from the vulnerability to runs and the loss of liquidity, which are inherent in banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.17,0)">The fact is, however, that runs by securities investors can and do occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Analogous to bank runs, securities investors can run   in favour of higher liquidity and lower risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.34,0)">Herding behaviour may take place if investors copy the actions of others, who are presumed to be better informed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">While herding is more often associated with less informed retail investors, evidence suggests that it might even take place among professional investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.88,0)">However, while rushes to exit particular securities or collective investments can cause large swings in market prices, this does not necessarily imply a risk of failure for securities businesses operating a separate balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.29,0)">This is so for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.06,0)">First, if the own funds supporting the securities business are separated from the customer funds, the risks are directly borne by investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Second, if tradable assets can be downsized in step with investors' withdrawals, financial institutions can avoid the losses and risk of failure associated with banking, where fixed-value deposits need to be met by selling illiquid loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This difference in the fragility to runs has constituted an important wall between banking and securities activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.82,0)">Market developments, however, suggest that securities operations of banks or non-bank financial firms could be increasingly fragile vis-à-vis outflows of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.06,0)">Many institutions - including institutional investors, investment banks and other regulated or unregulated entities, as well as banks - can engage in proprietary trading at their own risk and hold positions in complex financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.16,0)">In circumstances of market stress in particular, these positions can turn out to be illiquid, to be cancelled or reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.61,0)">Moreover, if leverage is extensively used to fund positions, the firms engaging in these activities can become much more vulnerable, as shown by past incidents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.47,0)">15.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.17,0)">The second part of the proposition concerns contagion and states that this risk would be in any case confined to banking, even when a run to sell securities occurs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.79,0)">However, in addition to the risks stemming from their own securities activities, banks could be affected in two main ways by failure in the securities businesses of other financial institutions - exposing the financial system to potential instability, because of the traditional systemic relevance of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.03,0)">First, banks could be seriously affected via their counterparty credit exposures to other financial intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Whereas significant credit exposures have traditionally occurred mainly within the banking system from clearing and settlement systems and interbank operations, the increased trading in complex financial instruments has led to a potentially important concentration of credit exposure of banks vis-à-vis securities firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the case of LTCM, for example, such exposures arose from OTC derivatives, prime brokerage and clearing, as well as regular lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.36,0)">Second, the LTCM incidence brought up another, and possibly even more important channel of contagion to banks, one arising from the impact on market prices and liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.6,0)">At worst, the failure of a major securities market player - or even a disorderly winding down of its positions - could severely depress prices in illiquid markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.58,0)">This could happen to such a point where other firms holding important risk concentrations in the same markets would also incur major losses and even face the risk of insolvency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.7,0)">In the LTCM case, financial stability concerns were more related to this channel of contagion than the credit exposures of banks - as can be inferred from the statements made on the occasion by Chairman Greenspan and President McDonough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.92,0)">The very high use of leverage made the notional positions of LTCM very large, increasing the potential size of the shock to market prices and liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.86,0)">In principle, non-financial firms could also be a source of fragility to banks and the whole financial system in case of financial market turbulence for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.55,0)">First, non-financial firms could also face important market risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.7,0)">Second, collateral values could be affected by market prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">However, the risks for banks could be greater from other financial institutions than from non- financial firms because financial institutions can be highly leveraged, have very large market positions and can have closer links with banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.19,0)">16.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.06,0)">Thus far I have been talking about the risk to financial stability in terms of whether or not the banking system has been affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.48,0)">Another issue is whether the failure of an independent securities firm could by itself be a source of risk to financial stability, even when banks are not affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.15,0)">Here my conclusion would be negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.96,0)">If we look back at the episodes of turbulence over the last decade, a common observation is that difficulties assumed systemic relevance only when the banking system itself was hit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">When it occurred outside the banking system, turbulence could be managed as long as banks were in a position to support the liquidity needs of other intermediaries, letting the insolvent ones face their destiny and mitigating the risk of an overall market collapse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Thus, it seems to me that we can maintain the view that crises not involving banks or a disruption of the monetary process - what Anna Schwartz called "pseudo crises" - will have few overall financial stability implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This notion is probably the most fundamental wall between banking and securities activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.89,0)">It is frequently argued that technological and financial innovation, enabling non-banks to mimic traditional banking products, such as loans and payment services, erodes the special position of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However - as I have stressed on other occasions - the reason why banks are special is not related to the non-marketability of their instruments or the uniqueness of their individual products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.97,0)">It is related instead to the functioning of banks as central players providing and re-distributing liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This function is based on the joint supply of deposits and loans - offering continuous access to liquidity - and to the maturity transformation of short-term liabilities into long-term assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">These essential functions of banks cannot be easily broken into components, since - as recent research further shows - deposit taking and providing credit lines can be seen as manifestations of the same liquidity provision function and there are strong synergies between them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Banks also hold natural positions between central banks - the ultimate sources of liquidity - and the rest of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.27,0)">17.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.26,0)">To conclude, it seems to me that market developments have four main risk implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.74,0)">Firstly, individual financial institutions are confronted with a more complex and fluid risk profile, which requires upgraded risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.07,0)">Secondly, potential disruptions to the financial system could well originate from securities activities, since there could be spill-over effects jeopardising the soundness of major banking organisations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However, this does not amount to saying that non-bank financial institutions are becoming systemically relevant in their own right if the banking system is not affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Indeed, the special role of banks in providing liquidity leads to the consideration that the extension of the public safety net to non-bank financial institutions or securities markets in general would not be warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.06,0)">Thirdly, major financial disruptions could more easily spread across borders via credit exposures, or market price and liquidity conditions, because of the integration of markets and the internationalisation of financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">The euro area is a special case in this respect, given its fully integrated money market and increasingly common capital markets operating in the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Fourthly, and finally, the potential impact of securities activities on the stability of the financial system is likely to increase, to the extent that the market trends outlined before will continue in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.3,0)">REGULATION 18.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.86,0)">I can now enter the last topic, which concerns the implications of the above for the regulatory and supervisory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">First a few words about the original framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In banking, the prominent attention on financial stability stemmed from the dominance of banking services in the financial system and the concentration of financial risks in banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The financial stability focus became predominant in the early decades of the last century - and particularly after the Great Depression - to guarantee the channelling of funds to productive investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">However, there was also a strong social concern to protect the unsophisticated depositors, who used to be called   "widows and orphans".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">There was no strong economic or social pressure to protect the securities investments of the then relatively few affluent individuals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Market transparency was considered adequate to protect their interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.97,0)">Hence, securities market regulation was largely initiated to protect investors - such as the disclosure and registration requirements for issuers of traded securities in the US Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.76,0)">The latter Act also made most types of manipulation of market prices, foremost insider trading, illegal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In the EU, many important pieces of Community legislation have been enacted since the mid-1980s, when the Directive on prospectuses was adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.46,0)">However, in comparison with the banking regulation, the securities regulation is still less developed at the Community level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">This explains why the completion of the EU regulatory framework in the securities field to foster further integration of securities markets represents one of the major objectives of the Financial Services Action Plan put forward by the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.31,0)">The institutional separation between banking and securities - as for instance laid down in the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 - was a cornerstone of regulation in those countries which did not maintain the universal banking model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This regulation was principally brought into force to limit the risks faced by financial institutions and to prevent possible conflicts of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In addition, several types of conduct-of-business regulations have been applied to securities firms to protect investors' interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The distinction between the primary objectives applied to the banking and securities regulation still holds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">For example, financial stability-oriented provisions of prudential supervision and macro-prudential surveillance are far more extensive for banks than for securities firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Nevertheless, a bridge between the two approaches has started to be built.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Prudential elements are being exported from the banking sector into the securities regulation, and regulations supporting market transparency and competitive equality are being imported from the securities field into banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.49,0)">19.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Prudential standards exported from the banking sector to the securities field include capital adequacy requirements and consolidated supervision to cover the overall risks of financial conglomerates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These standards are often coupled with some form of investor protection through a dedicated compensation scheme to protect investors against a failure of a securities intermediary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, the role of capital - as a buffer to cover risks - could be considered more limited in the securities field than in banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.39,0)">Whereas in the banking sector regulatory capital is for the time being also intended to cover expected losses, securities firms' expected losses are already considered to be included in the continuous valuation of the assets of the firms, due to the application of the marked-to-market accounting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.23,0)">Accordingly, the regulatory capital of securities firms does not cover expected losses, and therefore buffers to withstand risks may not always be adequate in the case of considerable market turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.67,0)">The fact that banks continue to be special justifies the differences between the regulatory and supervisory framework relating to banking and that relating to securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.14,0)">Hence, a full harmonisation of the prudential frameworks would not be appropriate, because there is a need to restrict the access to central bank liquidity to more tightly regulated and supervised banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">A closer control of banks is also needed to counterbalance the competitive benefits and potential moral hazard consequences which stem from the access of banks to the public safety net.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.6,0)">20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Conversely, important elements of the original securities regulation are increasingly imported into the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.78,0)">I refer in particular to the transparency requirements, which have been traditionally the main domain of securities regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">These requirements are increasingly applied in the banking sector, since it is now widely recognised that market discipline stemming from enhanced transparency also provides banks with incentives to behave in a prudent and sound manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This in turn enhances the stability of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The role of market discipline is fully acknowledged in the New Basel Accord with the inclusion of extended disclosure requirements for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The implementation of the New Accord will be an important opportunity for the EU, since in this area the frequency and content of banks' disclosure needs to be improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.3,0)">However, disclosure, necessary as it is, is not a sufficient condition to ensure effective market discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.77,0)">Some stakeholders of banks might not have adequate incentives to monitor banks and exercise discipline on managers, as they expect to be protected by the public safety net.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In this respect, a decision to exclude major creditors of banks from the deposit insurance scheme would narrow even further the gap between the two regulatory approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Other attempts to import elements from the securities field into the banking sector are, in my view, much less desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I refer in particular to the recent proposal by international accounting standard setters to replace the historical cost-based accounting by full fair value accounting in banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This proposal needs to be viewed critically - as also recently expressed by the European Central Bank - for the main reason that a reasonably accurate fair value cannot be determined for a large part of the banking book.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.84,0)">Secondary markets do not exist for most bank loans and current techniques to determine loan values suffer from many methodological problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.42,0)">As a consequence, reliability, transparency and comparability of financial statements would not be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.92,0)">21.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The process of cross-fertilisation between the two regulatory approaches contributes to upgrading both of them and helps them to meet the challenges stemming from the market developments and from the bridges that have been built between banking and securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Although I do not see a need to thoroughly revise these regulatory frameworks, there are two issues which need close monitoring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.23,0)">The first is the possibility of conflicts of interest arising when the provision of services to a corporate client is combined with investing funds of other customers in the securities issued by that corporate client.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.62,0)">During the recent fall of technology stocks, for example, some intermediaries have indeed been accused of investing customer funds to keep up a favourable market price for important corporate clients whose performance had already deteriorated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Whilst this concern can apply to all institutions combining the two functions, it becomes particularly relevant for banks, since they have extensive "placing powers" to influence the choices of retail investors and provide - at the same time - lending and other services to firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">This concern might become increasingly important in Europe owing to the recent expansion of investment in securities by retail clients and the involvement of banks in securities business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.67,0)">Actual or suspected misbehaviour can also be an important risk for financial institutions, which rely on excellent reputation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Without questioning the strong reasons that led to its abandonment, one should not forget that the Glass-Steagall type of regulation was originally conceived to provide strong safeguards against the conflict of interest by clearly separating banking from securities activities, rather than relying on internal Chinese walls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.18,0)">Now, the burden to address the issue of conflict of interest falls on the various conduct-of-business regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The effectiveness of these regulations needs to be closely and rigorously monitored, knowing that we might not have seen yet the full implications of the removal of Glass- Steagall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.06,0)">The second issue relates to the existence of non-regulated securities firms, whose failure might generate major financial disruptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Examples of these institutions are leveraged private investment vehicles like hedge funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.46,0)">Such firms are not even subject to disclosure and conduct-of-business regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">After the LTCM case international bodies have, as you know, carefully examined the need for regulating hedge funds and other highly leveraged institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">However, difficulties in enforcing regulations have so far only led to indirect responses, which intend to strengthen counterparty risk management by banks in order to prevent systemic contagion of hedge fund problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Also, parallel attempts to develop market pressure towards voluntary transparency by hedge funds have not yielded significant results, mainly because the key competitive advantage of hedge funds lies with their secret trading strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Global hedge fund activity has resumed high growth after a pause following the LTCM incident.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Thus, I remain convinced of the need to continue to monitor the problems posed by highly leveraged institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Now that I have discussed regulatory issues, let me touch briefly upon some implications in the field of prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">In general terms, the development of strong bridges between banking and securities activities provides a clear justification for stepping up the monitoring of risks stemming from the securities business to individual financial institutions and the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The previous analysis of the risks to individual institutions suggests that particular challenges for risk monitoring arise in the area of micro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.15,0)">They stem from changing risk profiles towards market and income volatility risks, non-transparent and complex risk positions of financial institutions, potential risk re-allocation and concentration, and complex corporate structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">The effectiveness of the supervisory action requires closer co-operation at the national level between the supervision of banking and securities activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">As for the field of macro-prudential supervision, the previous discussion on the risk to financial stability suggests that the principal need is to place adequate emphasis on the monitoring of securities activities as a possible source of major disruption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The effectiveness of the macro-prudential monitoring calls for a strengthening of co-operation between central bank functions and the micro-prudential tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">There are undoubtedly strong synergies between micro- and macro- prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">On the one hand, the monitoring of systemic stability benefits from information about key individual players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">On the other hand, the monitoring of individual financial institutions gains from macro-prudential supervision, payment and settlement systems oversight and market surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.16,0)">24.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The need for close co-operation between the supervision of banking and securities   also has a bearing on the organisation of supervision at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">In principle, there are three possible approaches to strengthening the links between the three supervisory functions, notably the single agency model, the "twin peaks" model, and a formalised co­ operation via "umbrella bodies" between specialised supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The balance of the different theoretical arguments is, to my mind, not clear-cut, and institutional choices can also be determined by practical considerations pertaining to the historical tradition and the institutional environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">In practice, what matters in this context is that all three approaches can   achieve satisfactory results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.14,0)">25.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The need to enhance the monitoring of risks to financial stability stemming from securities activities is also present at the international level, given the internationalisation of major financial institutions and the increased integration of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This entails a strengthening of co-operation between all relevant authorities on a cross-border and cross-sector basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.24,0)">International securities markets have indeed been affected by major disturbances in recent times - e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.49,0)">the Mexican and Asian financial crises and the Russian default.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.71,0)">These incidents have drawn attention and caused concern in particular because there was a risk of spreading market tensions across countries and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Among the various policy responses, one should stress the importance of the Financial Stability Forum, which was set up in 1999 with the aim of strengthening cross-sector co-operation on a global basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">With regard to Europe, the relevance of cross-border co-operation between micro- and macro-prudential supervision has been fully recognised by policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Firstly, the Economic and Financial Committee of the EU acknowledged the need to foster the exchange of information on major financial institutions and market trends between supervisory authorities and central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Secondly, the Committee of Wise Men proposed a more effective and responsive decision-making process for the EU regulation in the securities field and also recommended establishing co-operation mechanisms between micro- and macro-prudential supervisors to tackle the systemic risk issues arising from the increasing integration of securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">One possible way of implementing these recommendations would be to develop co­ operation between the Banking Supervision Committee of the ESCB and the new Committee of European Securities Regulators, given that the Banking Supervision Committee is already involved in fairly extensive activities in the macro-prudential analysis of the EU banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.59,0)">V. CONCLUSION 26.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The aim of my lecture has been to examine the relationship between banking and securities activities in the light of a number of market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">I did this with particular regard to the EU financial system, where the importance of securities markets has significantly increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">I observed the emergence of several strong bridges between banking and securities activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I noted, as a consequence, the possibility of increased and new types of risks to individual financial institutions and the financial system as a whole arising out of securities activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.62,0)">I took the view, however, that this should not lead to the consideration that non-bank financial firms have become sources of systemic risk in their own right, as long as the banking system itself is not disrupted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Indeed, the special role of banks in the liquidity provision remains a basic distinction between banking and securities businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">A notable development is the concurrent exporting of prudential requirements of the banking regulation into the securities field, and the importing of transparency requirements into the banking sector from the securities regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">This cross-fertilisation can be deemed mutually beneficial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Whilst I do regard the present regulatory framework for securities activities to be on the whole adequate from the stability perspective as well, there is a need to monitor the continued effectiveness of the framework for the reasons I have mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Stepping up the micro- and macro-prudential monitoring of risks emerging from securities activities should be a clear priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This entails strengthening co-operation among sectoral supervisors in the micro-prudential field, and between them and central banks in the macro-prudential field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The strengthening of co-operation should take place both at the national level and on a cross-border basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">On the euro banknotes we have the images of bridges and windows, representing the connection and openness between countries and peoples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The image I have chosen for this lecture on the relationship between banking and securities activities is that of bridges and walls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">As I have suggested, there are increasingly strong bridges between banking and securities activities, which were previously separated by walls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.58,0)">Since some of these walls continue to remain in place, I had to be more cautious and could not borrow the image in full from the euro banknotes.</span>
