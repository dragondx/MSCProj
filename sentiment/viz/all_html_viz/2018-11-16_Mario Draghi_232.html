    <h1> The outlook for the euro area economy </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Frankfurt European Banking Congress, Frankfurt am Main, 16 November 2018 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)"> The outlook for the euro area economy Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Frankfurt European Banking Congress, Frankfurt am Main, 16 November 2018 The euro area economy has now been growing for five years, and we expect the expansion to continue in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.41,0)">Yet we have recently seen a loss in growth momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.13,0)">In both of the last two quarterly ECB growth projections, our staff has revised down its estimates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.36,0)">Actual data have also been weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.46,0)">The flash estimate for euro area growth in the third quarter was just 0.2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The slowdown has raised questions about the strength of the growth outlook and, in turn, about whether the ongoing convergence of inflation towards our objective will be sustained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I would like to address these questions in my remarks this morning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.01,0)">The key issue at stake is as follows: are we witnessing a temporary “soft patch” or a more lasting deterioration in the growth outlook?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.91,0)">There is certainly no reason why the expansion in the euro area should abruptly come to an end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">A gradual slowdown is normal as expansions mature and growth converges towards its long-run potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.68,0)">But the expansion in the euro area is still relatively short in length and small in size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Since 1975 there have been five periods of rising GDP in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The average duration from trough to peak is 31 quarters, with GDP increasing by 21% over that period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.81,0)">The current expansion in the euro area, however, has lasted just 22 quarters and GDP is only around 10% above the trough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In contrast, the expansion in the United States has lasted 37 quarters, and GDP has risen by 21%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.17,0)">In light of this, it is important to understand the sources of the growth slowdown we have witnessed this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">At present there are two main sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.2,0)">The first is one-off factors, which have clearly played an important role in the underperformance of growth since the start of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.69,0)">In the first half of 2018, weather, sickness and industrial action affected output in a number of countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.74,0)">And in the third quarter, we saw a significant disruption of car production created by the introduction of new vehicle emissions standards on 1 September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.73,0)">Production slowed as carmakers tried to avoid building up inventory of untested models, which weighed heavily on economies with large automobile sectors, such as Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.56,0)">Indeed, the German economy actually contracted in the third quarter, removing at least 0.1 percentage points from quarterly euro area growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.35,0)">But this effect should be temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.55,0)">As the testing backlog clears, car production should return to normal by the end of the year and the effect on output should dissipate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.21,0)">The latest data already show production normalising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.47,0)">The second source of the slowdown has been weaker trade growth, which is broader-based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Net exports contributed 1.4 percentage points to euro area growth in 2017, while so far this year they have removed 0.2 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.53,0)">World trade growth decelerated from 5.2% in 2017 to 4.6% in the first half of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.42,0)">We are witnessing a long-term slowdown in world trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.04,0)">Some of the factors that previously drove its rapid expansion, such as trade liberalisation and the creation of global value chains, have waned since the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">We are also witnessing a cyclical correction from the very strong trade growth recorded last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.19,0)">Trade dynamics are now normalising as global growth retreats towards potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.0,0)">Insofar as world trade stabilises at a lower level, its drag on growth could also be temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">But there are two conditions that could make it longer-lasting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.71,0)">The first is if trade uncertainty rises and dampens euro area export performance, in particular owing to protectionism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The preliminary trade agreement reached between the US, Canada and Mexico reduces some uncertainty, but other disputes remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Some indicators suggest this is feeding into the trade outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,7.9,0)">The manufacturing PMI for the euro area fell to a two-year low in October, with export-oriented economies recording particularly large drops.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.5,0)">New export orders contracted for the first time since 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The second condition is if uncertainty about external demand spills over into domestic demand through confidence and investment channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.8,0)">For now, there is little tangible evidence that the moderation in growth has affected business investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.23,0)">But there is some evidence that those euro area firms that are most likely to be affected by proposed tariffs have reduced their rate of capital spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.69,0)">Moreover, the slowdown in imports has particularly affected capital and intermediate goods, which might signal that firms are scaling back their investment decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">So we need to monitor these trade risks very carefully over the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">However, we still see the overall risks to the growth outlook as broadly balanced, in large part because the underlying drivers of domestic demand remain in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Most important is the virtuous circle between employment, labour income and consumption, which has been the motor of growth throughout the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.54,0)">Various indicators suggest this cycle has not been disrupted by the loss of growth momentum this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Employment growth remains relatively strong, even though the latest data suggest some slowdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The contribution of labour income to household income growth in the first half of this year was the strongest in a decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">And consumer confidence remains above its long-run average in the euro area and across most economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.34,0)">Perceptions about the general economic climate have declined somewhat this year, but consumers’ assessments of their personal situation – which tend to be more correlated with consumption – have remained steady.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">There are three considerations that underpin our view that this cycle is resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">First, an important force behind employment growth in the euro area is longer-term structural changes, and these are less sensitive to cyclical swings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Over the past five years, employment has increased by 9.5 million people, rising by 2.6 million in Germany, 2.1 million in Spain, 1 million in France and 1 million in Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">This growth is similar to the five years before the crisis, when employment grew by 10 million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In that period, however, close to 70% of employment growth was “prime age”, meaning it came from the 25-54 age group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">But since 2013 more than 70% of employment growth has come from those aged 55-74.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This partly reflects the impact of past structural reforms, such as to pension systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Indeed, the participation rate of people aged 55-74 has almost doubled, from around 20% in 1999 to 38% in 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The share of women in work has also risen by more than 10 percentage points since the start of EMU to almost 60% – its highest level ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In addition, countries that have implemented structural reforms have in general seen a rise in labour demand in recent years compared with the pre-crisis period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Germany, Portugal and Spain are all good examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The second consideration that points to the resilience of domestic demand is the strong link between consumption and job growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Consumption is much more conducive to jobs than exports, reflecting the higher labour-intensity of services, which are the bulk of consumers’ expenditure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.56,0)">In contrast, exports have a higher manufacturing content and are less labour intensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.25,0)">This is one reason why the labour market recovery was not affected by the contraction in world trade in 2015-16.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.72,0)">In fact, the continued strength of consumption may explain why firms are still hiring even as growth slows, with permanent contracts accounting for the vast majority of the increase in employment this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.08,0)">But clearly this could change if firms start to see the slowdown as more persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The third consideration is the still very favourable financing conditions in the euro area, underpinned by our accommodative monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.87,0)">The cost of bank borrowing for firms fell to record lows in the first half of this year across all large euro area economies, while the growth of loans to firms stood at its highest rate since 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The growth rate of loans to households is also the strongest since 2012, with consumer credit now acting as the most dynamic component, reflecting the ongoing strength of consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Household net worth remains at solid levels on the back of rising house prices and is adding to continued consumption growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.01,0)">But there are some risks to financing conditions as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.87,0)">Lack of fiscal consolidation in high-debt countries increases their vulnerability to shocks, whether those shocks are autonomously produced by questioning the rules of EMU’s architecture, or are imported through financial contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.08,0)">So far, the rise in sovereign spreads has been mostly restricted to the first case and contagion across countries has been limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.79,0)">Such developments feed into tighter bank lending conditions for the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.73,0)">To date, though some repricing in bank lending is happening where the rise in spreads has been more significant, overall bank funding costs remain near historical lows in all large countries, thanks to a steady deposit base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">To protect their households and firms from rising interest rates, high-debt countries should not increase their debt even further and all countries should respect the rules of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.74,0)">Other risks stem from the possibility of a disorderly increase in global risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.83,0)">The reaction of asset prices to surprise inflation in other jurisdictions at a more advanced stage in the business cycle, a return to the financial deregulation that was the primary cause of the financial crisis, and fragilities in several emerging market economies exposed to currency mismatches, are all risks that warrant close monitoring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.85,0)">Outlook for inflation and monetary policy So, how is the growth picture affecting the outlook for inflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Here we need to assess to what extent wage growth will be robust to slowing growth momentum, and to what extent wage increases will pass through to prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The link between output growth and wage growth in the euro area has strengthened compared with recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.7,0)">As the domestic expansion continues, wage pressures have started to build and have surprised on the upside this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Annual growth in compensation per employee reached 2.3% in the second quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">This increase is broad-based and present across most sectors and euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Two factors suggest wage growth should be resilient to a period of slower growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The first is that the labour market is already showing signs of tightness, and this should remain the case so long as growth continues at or above potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.76,0)">Labour shortages have become more prominent and widespread across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.57,0)">Broader measures of slack – that include underemployed workers – have also fallen substantially, although there is still some heterogeneity across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.71,0)">The second factor is the changing composition of wage growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.3,0)">The initial pick-up in wages from the trough in 2016 was driven by wage drift, which includes components such as bonuses and overtime and tends to react more quickly to the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">But more recently negotiated wages have strengthened, rising from the trough of 1.4% in mid-2016 to 2.2% in the second quarter of 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Negotiated wage agreements frequently last two or three years, suggesting that higher rates of wage growth are likely to persist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">However, the next leg of the inflation process – the pass-through of wage growth to prices – remains relatively muted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Measures of underlying inflation, such as core inflation, continue to hover around 1% and have yet to show a convincing upward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">To some extent, this lagged response is in line with the standard pattern of demand-driven expansions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">As demand picks up, employment initially reacts slowly, which boosts overall productivity and lifts margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Firms therefore have little need to increase prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.13,0)">But as the expansion matures, businesses increase wages more strongly to attract labour, and unit labour costs rise, squeezing margins and putting upward pressure on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">This pattern has been visible in the euro area since the start of 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.27,0)">Unit labour cost growth fell initially last year, but rose measurably this year to reach 1.6% in the second quarter, its strongest rate since the start of 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.19,0)">There is evidence that margins are now being squeezed, with unit profit growth decreasing substantially from 2.7% in the third quarter of 2017 to 0.7% in the second quarter of 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">We should therefore expect price pressures in the euro area to mount.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">However, the speed of this process is state-dependent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Preliminary ECB research finds that the recent history of inflation is a key factor in the speed and strength of the pass-through from wages to prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">The pass-through is systematically faster and stronger in periods of higher inflation than in periods of lower inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Thus, following several years of low inflation in the euro area, a more tentative pass-through of wages to prices is understandable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.94,0)">But as labour costs rise, the buffer room for absorbing cost increases through margins will eventually vanish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">As price increases become more widespread and firms become more confident about their pricing power, we should see a higher degree of pass-through.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.62,0)">That said, if firms start to become more uncertain about the growth and inflation outlook, the squeeze on margins could prove more persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.03,0)">This would affect the speed with which underlying inflation picks up and therefore the inflation path that we expect to see in the quarters ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">When the Governing Council met in October, we confirmed our confidence in the economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The underlying strength of domestic demand and wages continues to support our view that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim will proceed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">But in the light of the lags between wages and prices after a period of low inflation, patience and persistence in our monetary policy is still needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">With monetary policy providing a significant degree of stimulus through our interest rate policy, stock of acquired assets and reinvestments of maturing bonds, the Governing Council assessed that inflation convergence could be maintained even after a gradual winding-down of our net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.97,0)">Subject to incoming data confirming this assessment, we anticipate that net asset purchases will come to an end in December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">However, the Governing Council also noted that uncertainties surrounding the medium-term outlook have increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">When the latest round of projections is available at our next meeting in December, we will be better placed to make a full assessment of the risks to growth and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">We have conveyed that we expect interest rates to remain at their present levels at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that inflation continues to move towards our aim in a sustained manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">And we have stated that reinvestments will continue for an extended period of time after the end of net purchases, and in any case for as long as necessary to maintain favourable liquidity conditions and an ample degree of monetary accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The nature of this forward guidance is contingent on economic developments and therefore acts as an automatic stabiliser.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">If financial or liquidity conditions should tighten unduly or if the inflation outlook should deteriorate, our reaction function is well defined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">This should in turn be reflected in an adjustment in the expected path of future interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Our forward guidance has been effective in anchoring expectations about the future path of interest rates and preventing an undue tightening of monetary policy caused by premature expectations of policy normalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">It has also helped shield financial conditions in the euro area from policy changes in other jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Conclusion In conclusion, I want to emphasise how completing Economic and Monetary Union has become more urgent over time not less urgent – and not only for the economic reasoning that has always underpinned my remarks, but also to preserve our European construction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.22,0)">This is my last speech at this conference as President of the ECB, and in preparing for it, I looked back at the speech I gave here in November 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">There I lamented that the economic crisis would require a faster pace in strengthening the Monetary Union, especially for decisions that had already been taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This perhaps has a familiar ring today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Since then, the work has been remarkable, but it is still far from finished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.41,0)">The completion of the banking union in all its dimensions, including risk reduction, and the start of the capital markets union through implementing all ongoing initiatives by 2019, have now become as urgent as the first steps were in euro area crisis management seven years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">These are urgent today not because of an economic crisis that we have successfully addressed, but because they are the best response to the threats that are being levied at our monetary union: to these threats, more Europe is the answer.</span><span
