    <h3> Speaker: Vítor Constâncio </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)"> Securities settlement in 2020: T2S and beyond Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the ECB’s conference on “Securities settlement in 2020: T2S and beyond”, Frankfurt am Main, 4 October 2011 I am very pleased for the opportunity to be with you here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.18,0)">As you might know, the President’s visit to the European Parliament for the last Monetary Dialogue of his tenure was rescheduled at the last minute, so it was not possible for him to participate tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">He sends his apologies and wishes you a very interesting and fruitful conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">In my remarks this afternoon, I would like to focus on the importance of strengthening the Single Market, the various initiatives currently being pursued for this purpose, and how T2S fits into the wider picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The Single Market, and the Single Financial Market in particular, has been one of the great success stories of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Since the project began with Jacques Delors’s White Paper in 1985 and almost 20 years since the 1992 programme was completed, it has delivered enormous economic, financial and social benefits to the citizens of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">The euro has played a major role in delivering the benefits of a Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">It has ensured price stability, removed exchange rate uncertainty and reduced transaction costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">All this is conducive to an integrated market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In times of urgency, we may sometimes take for granted the benefits that the Single Market has already brought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Freedom of goods, freedom of services, freedom of capital, and freedom of people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.63,0)">Indeed, in recent years we have been observing sometimes less focus on the need for further progress in the Single Market and even protectionist tendencies, which were also exacerbated by concerns raised by the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">However, the financial crisis should instead serve as a powerful reminder that only a fully fledged integrated single market can provide the resilience that we need to withstand future shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The Single Market Act, launched in April by the European Commission is therefore very much welcomed to provide impetus to the reinforcement of the project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.93,0)">This is also what is wished by citizens, since the very recent Eurobarometer survey of 26 September shows that there are still important gaps between expectations and the reality of the single market: information gaps affecting citizens and authorities, gaps in the implementation of European policy, and gaps in the European legislative framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Against this background, I would like to highlight the progress made in the Single Financial Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Some initiatives were started before the crisis and are still in progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.81,0)">Others have been launched since the outbreak of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I would like to briefly mention just some of these important developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">First, Europe’s new supervisory structure, based on the European Systemic Risk Board and the three European supervisory authorities, is a major step forward in ensuring that the financial system as a whole is supervised in a more harmonised and coherent fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It reflects the full acknowledgement that the externalities deriving from the financial system are no longer national.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">They are increasingly interconnected across the European market and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Second, there is also a new set of new legislation to reform financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">It is a comprehensive package covering not only the trading level, but also – for the first time – the infrastructures for clearing and settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Nothing is being missed out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">MiFID – which deals with trading and investment services – is currently being updated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">A new regulation on clearing houses – called the European Market Infrastructure Regulation   – is also being proposed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The objective of MiFID and the EMIR is not only to make markets safer, sounder and more transparent in the wake of the financial crisis; they also aim to create a level playing field in Europe, to remove barriers to competition, and ultimately, to strengthen the financial market integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">On the settlement and issuer services side, a proposal for a new legislation on CSDs is expected soon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">This will help to ensure a level playing field between the different business models operating across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">And on the custody side, the proposed Securities Law Directive will also help provide legal certainty and facilitate cross-border business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">T2S fits extremely well into the financial market reform process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">It very much complements the regulatory initiatives being pursued by the European authorities to significantly strengthen the Single Financial Market and its infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">T2S will – for the first time – create a single market in the settlement services space.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Combined with legislation on CSDs and CCPs as well as MiFID, T2S will stimulate a new competitive environment in post-trading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Over the longer term, T2S will deliver significant benefits to the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">First, in T2S it will be as easy to settle cross-border transactions as domestic ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">This will enhance the ability of issuers and investors to reach across national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">It will lower the cost of capital for issuers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">It will allow investors to diversify their investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Second, T2S will be an indispensable tool for banks to optimise their collateral management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It will eliminate the need to hold multiple buffers of collateral across various CSDs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It will eliminate the need to shift securities across borders in order to use them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The savings in collateral will be very significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">This is, of course, a huge benefit for market participants at a time when demand for collateral is ever increasing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Third, T2S will foster harmonisation in the post-trade world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.31,0)">The T2S platform is, of course, not sufficient in itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.46,0)">But it is a necessary condition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">And it will play a crucial catalyst role going forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The Governing Council made an initial proposal for T2S back in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">After receiving positive feedback from the market, it decided to go ahead with developing the platform in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">I want to emphasise that the Governing Council remains as committed as ever to delivering T2S as a key component of the European market infrastructure, particularly for the purpose of the adequate implementation of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Accordingly, let me reassure you that the Governing Council will do all it can to make sure that T2S will be a resounding success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">I am happy to say that, during the crisis, the current market infrastructures in Europe proved their resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In the future, T2S will be a core part of Europe’s financial market infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">It must, therefore, also be extremely robust and resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">As a central bank, we have all the incentives to make this so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Because T2S is a single platform settling in central bank money, it will further promote the financial stability of market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">It will provide additional resilience to cross-border settlement, which is still somewhat lacking today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And settlement in central bank money is the safest form of cash settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.41,0)">T2S will only settle in central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">To be a success, the economics underlying the business case for the project must also be favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">T2S must deliver the cost efficiencies that we have promised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">I am very confident that, in the longer term, T2S will produce significant reductions in post-trading costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Not least because of the new element of competition that T2S will create in the market and its dynamic effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Over time I expect settlement costs to decrease to levels comparable to those in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">But even more important than delivering such cost efficiencies, T2S will create new opportunities for “value creation”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">T2S will standardise and commoditise settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Private sector companies will now be in a position to innovate products that add more value for their clients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">It will lead to the creation of new products that have not even been thought of today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Ultimately, this stimulation to innovation and a higher quality of service could be the real benefits of T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The overall theme of the conference is what we envisage for “Securities settlement in 2020: T2S and beyond”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">As you well know, the Europe 2020 strategy launched by the Commission in March 2010 aims at delivering a European economy with high-levels of employment, research and innovation, education, environmental and energy standards, with much less poverty and social exclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">A much stronger economic governance framework should also ensure closer fiscal integration and sound public finances as a pillar of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Accordingly, I very much hope that your reflections in this conference will help developing the key features of the securities market infrastructure that we need in 2020 to support our economy, as well as safeguarding financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">I hope you enjoy the rest of the conference.</span>
