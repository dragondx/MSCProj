    <span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)"> The euro as a catalyst for integration and competition in EMU Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of the 30th Economics Conference "Competition of Regions and Integration in EMU", Vienna, 13 June 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Ladies and Gentlemen, Here in Vienna, exactly one hundred years ago, Joseph Schumpeter embarked upon his university studies at the School of Law and Political Science.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">He was a promising young student with ambitions in academics, politics and business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Already, at the age of 22, he had published his first works and would soon become one of the youngest holders of a doctorate, the youngest private teacher and the youngest professor in Austria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Joseph Schumpeter has become known as one of the foremost representatives of the famous Austrian School of Economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">He has influenced economic thought, in particular, by introducing innovation as a source of economic dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.52,0)">According to Schumpeter, economic development was a dynamic process, a disturbance of the economic status quo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.3,0)">The real challenge for capitalism, therefore, was to create and destroy economic structures in a process he called "creative destruction" This, he maintained, was the essence of economic development, a process defined by the implementation by the entrepreneur of new production combinations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I believe that Schumpeter would be very interested in the topic I want to discuss today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">My speech is about the euro as a catalyst for integration and competition in EMU, or, in other words, about economic growth and adjustment in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Both high, sustainable economic growth and the ability to adjust smoothly to changes in the economic environment require further economic integration and competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This, in turn, is closely linked to the process of structural reform, which, to use Schumpeter's words, can be seen as a necessary precondition for a dynamic economic process, a disturbance of the economic status quo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">The introduction of the euro acts as a catalyst for this dynamic process of structural change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In my speech today I will address the following topics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I will first talk about the link between European integration and the euro, and then argue why an increasingly competitive and dynamic society raises the need for further structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">However, reforms are also important for the smooth functioning of a monetary union, a point I will discuss next.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Finally, I will assess the progress that has been made with the structural reforms in the euro area so far and discuss how the single currency has already benefited the euro area's economy, acting – as formulated in the title of my speech – as a catalyst for integration and competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">A single currency for a single market A natural starting point for my topic today is the adoption of the Single Market Programme in 1985, paving the way for the famous four "liberties" established in the European Treaties: the free movement of goods, services, labour and capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.09,0)">After the adoption of the Single Market Programme, it became increasingly clear that the potential of the internal market could not be fully exploited while the relatively high transaction costs linked to currency conversion and the uncertainties associated with exchange-rate fluctuations persisted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Indeed, the single currency should be seen as a necessary complement or, in fact, the crowning achievement of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That said, we have not reached the end of the development of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Instead, I see the euro as facilitating further economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">For example, countries with the same currency tend to trade more with each other than they would with countries with different currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In addition, a single currency fosters the formation of a single financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">By increasing price transparency, reducing transaction costs and fostering competition, the euro acts as a powerful catalyst to the economic integration process in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Last, but not least, our common currency is also a powerful symbol for all citizens of the euro area that integration has reached a new level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">As we approach the first summer holiday season since the introduction of euro notes and coins, increasing numbers of people in Europe will, themselves, experience the practical advantages of a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The impetus the euro gives to economic integration and growth should not only be regarded as an opportunity for Europe, but also as a necessity in a world of innovation and globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Over the last few decades, the world economy has become ever more integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">We have witnessed a strong expansion of international trade and capital flows and an increase in competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Behind these changes there are several underlying factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Among the most important is rapid technological progress, leading to dramatic reductions in transportation costs and an unprecedented increase in information processing capabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Policy measures have also supported the globalisation trend, with the loosening of restrictions to trade and the liberalisation of capital movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">This panorama shows that we live in a dynamic and competitive world, where the ability to innovate and adjust to changing economic circumstances has become even more important than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In this respect, Schumpeter's thoughts haven't lost anything of their relevance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">On the contrary; in a dynamic, ever-changing economic environment, entrepreneurs have to be all the more innovative and sensitive to new opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The regulatory framework formed by the laws, rules and regulations that influence economic behaviour, should thus provide the right incentives for innovation, dynamism and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The EU Heads of State and Government have recognised that, in order to improve the functioning of the Single Market and to enhance the economic growth potential of the EU, its regulatory framework has to be modernised and reforms are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Somewhat more than two years ago, the Lisbon European Council formulated a strategic goal for this decade, namely "to become the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The Lisbon strategy established a comprehensive reform agenda which aims to overcome existing fragmentation and inefficiencies in many different areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This has provided a major political impetus for further progress in the field of structural reform that I very much welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The European Council aims to increase the potential GDP growth rate to around 3% per year, an objective which can only be achieved if steady progress on a broad range of reforms is made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Whether or not this objective is met hinges partly on the capacity to improve mobilisation of available labour resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">In this regard, one of the explicit objectives set at the Lisbon summit is to raise the EU-wide employment rate to 70% of the working age population by 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In order to achieve the Lisbon objective, it is crucial that progress is systematically controlled and evaluated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In this context, the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines for the Member States and the Community play a particularly important role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is the overall framework for the co-ordination of economic policies, in particular, those related to fiscal and structural policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">In order to fulfil this role, the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines have, in recent years, been enhanced in several ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">They have become more operational through the use of more concrete recommendations in both the general and country-specific parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Moreover, within the overall process of policy co-ordination, increased emphasis is being placed on implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">To this end, the European Commission has introduced a comprehensive implementation report that assesses the extent to which EU Member States have followed the policy recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">I fully support these changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">As you know, the most recent Spring meeting of the European Council, the second "follow-up" meeting to Lisbon, took place in Barcelona earlier this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The conclusions of the Barcelona Summit demonstrate that a strong political will and thorough preparation of the technical details are needed if the European Union is to meet the ambitious economic, social and environmental objectives that it set for itself at the Lisbon Summit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The successful introduction of the single currency is the best proof that these ingredients are indispensable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The main point now is that the relevant Council formations, the European Parliament and the Member States take the necessary steps to rigorously implement the structural reform agenda agreed in Lisbon and confirmed in Barcelona.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.27,0)">Why are structural reforms important?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Structural policies cover a wide range of areas and instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.67,0)">Among the most commonly discussed are microeconomic regulations implemented in product, labour and financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Among other things, such regulations encompass competition policies, entry barriers, tax and benefit systems, state aid, employment protection rules, education and training, as well as incentives given to research and development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">They are important for two main reasons since they enhance the economic growth potential and facilitate the adjustment to economic change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me say a few more words on these two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">First, structural policies are just one of many factors determining the rate at which the economy can grow, although there are many other factors which influence the rate of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.81,0)">Some factors, such as changes in demand conditions, have temporary effects on economic growth, whereas others, such as the rate of growth of the working age population and capital stock, as well as the increase in productivity, have long-lasting effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is this latter type of factor, however, that determines the potential growth rate of an economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">These components, in particular the growth of employment and productivity, can be influenced by structural policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Changes to tax and benefit systems, for example, can help to mobilise the unused labour potential in the economy by making it financially more attractive to accept a job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This could lead to a better use of the supply side potential of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The third factor, productivity growth, can be influenced in several ways: by increasing competition, facilitating investment, encouraging enterprise and innovation and improving the workforce's skills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Structural policies have particular importance for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">They allow the economy to grow at a higher rate, on a sustained basis, without creating inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">However, structural reforms are not only important for economic growth, they also increase adaptability to economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Adaptability concerns the economy's ability to adapt and respond to changing economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">It is the ability to shift resources from areas in recession to booming areas, something which is key to the successful functioning of a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.35,0)">Under EMU, member countries are unable to use country-specific monetary and exchange rate policies to address country-specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The adjustment to such economic fluctuations will therefore have to take place through other adjustment mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.73,0)">Without price and wage flexibility and mobility of production factors, economic shocks would lead to lower economic growth and higher unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Let me say a few more words on the important role of these adjustment mechanisms in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The theory of optimal currency areas Ever since the idea of EMU was launched, a discussion has ensued as to whether the whole or part of Europe would be an optimal currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.18,0)">The optimal currency area theory defines a set of mechanisms that might be set in motion when a participating country or region, in a monetary union, is hit by an asymmetric shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.14,0)">First, adjustment to the shock might come from domestic price or wage changes, thereby altering the real exchange rate without changing the nominal exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Secondly, migration of production factors might act as an adjustment channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">These flows of labour and capital are facilitated by a high degree of economic and financial integration of the countries participating in the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In addition to this, the theory of optimal currency areas has also something to say on the similarity of shocks affecting countries or regions in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In this respect, the degree of trade and financial integration are often considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Trade and financial integration may tend to lead to more similar economic developments in the respective countries or regions in a monetary union, reducing the likelihood of asymmetric shocks and increasing the economies' abilities to adjust to these shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">So far the theory, let me now move on to the practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I will now focus on two adjustment mechanisms: price-wage flexibility and factor mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">A host of empirical studies on these mechanisms has been undertaken for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">How well does the euro area measure up against these two criteria?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.37,0)">Price and wage flexibility There is broad agreement that price flexibility is low across euro area countries in comparison with the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.86,0)">In the euro area, price flexibility for goods and services is hampered by trade barriers, continuing state aid to several sectors and, more generally, a lack of competition in sectors that have been dominated by monopolies or state owned enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.53,0)">Low wage flexibility is also an important factor behind the lack of price flexibility in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.13,0)">Many studies indicate that in comparison with the United States, real wages are relatively inflexible in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.9,0)">More specifically, I mean that the downward responsiveness of real wages to the level of unemployment is more limited in Europe than in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">There are, however, notable differences across countries in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Let me also mention the potential links between the flexibility of product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Reforms in one area are likely to have effects across markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">For example, reforms leading to more flexible product markets might improve the performance of the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">If regulations on setting up a business are loosened, employment creation is also likely to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.54,0)">Similarly, labour market reforms might also have an impact on product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">For example, labour market reforms may improve the extent to which differences in skills or productivity are reflected in wage differentials, which could affect prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">More generally, more flexible labour markets allow companies to adjust to economic changes with greater ease.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Factor mobility Let me now turn to the second adjustment mechanism, the mobility of factors of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.03,0)">Changes in price levels, in product and labour markets, can also be triggered by a migration of factors of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.34,0)">If a country or region is affected by a negative output shock and markets do not clear instantaneously, unemployment will rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.98,0)">Workers will, therefore, tend to migrate to other regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.46,0)">The same might be true for capital: if a negative output shock made capital obsolete and reduced profitability, investors would tend to move their funds to other regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.24,0)">This adjustment mechanism has two limitations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.65,0)">First, the migration of labour and capital involves transaction costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.56,0)">Moreover, it is doubtful whether this mechanism is very efficient when a country or region is hit by a temporary shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Therefore, factor mobility seems a suitable adjustment mechanism only in case of a permanent shock and if prices or wages are rigid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Several studies have found that labour mobility within the United States is two to three times higher than in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">This result is confirmed by the persistence of regional unemployment differences in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.4,0)">Overall, it can be concluded from empirical studies that the degree of wage-price flexibility and factor mobility is relatively limited in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The lack of adjustment mechanisms in the euro area should, however, not be exaggerated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Euro area countries are highly integrated both in terms of trade and financially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">As I have just explained, a high degree of trade and financial integration may lead to more similar economic developments across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">In addition, the optimal currency area properties are likely to evolve over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The irrevocable fixing of exchange rates and the introduction of the single currency may lead to a convergence in the production and export structures of economies in the euro area, thereby reducing the risk of future asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This argument is often referred to as the "endogeneity" of the optimal currency area hypothesis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Hence, according to the endogeneity literature, the euro area could gradually become more of an optimal currency area, after the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">More generally, it has to be borne in mind that all empirical studies on whether the countries that have entered the euro area constitute an optimal currency area are based on historical data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.83,0)">These data refer to regimes with flexible or fixed-but-adjustable exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.41,0)">In short, the regime shift to a monetary union may have an impact on economic structures and may alter some of the conclusions drawn on the basis of these historical data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.43,0)">Progress made with structural reforms in the euro area Some people say that central bankers are professional sceptics whose job it is to point to economic risks and weaknesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Having listened to me so far, I can imagine that you may find some degree of truth in this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Let me tell you, however, that the euro area has recently seen many changes and innovations that go in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">And I am pleased to be able to tell you that many of these changes are directly, or indirectly, related to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let us have a closer look at three areas of change: financial markets, product markets and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Financial markets The first area I want to discuss are financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">There is ample evidence that financial markets have some way to go before national demarcation lines will effectively disappear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Henceforth, there is still a significant potential for further financial market integration in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Financial market integration has been driven by global developments, such as advances in information technology, falling communication costs and standardisation of products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">It has also been supported by European Commission initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">A main policy initiative that has contributed to financial market integration is the Financial Services Action Plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">EU Heads of State and Government have agreed to implement the Financial Services Action Plan by 2005, at the latest, and to achieve fully integrated risk-capital and securities markets by 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The groundwork for the latter was prepared by a Committee of Wise Men called the Lamfalussy Group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">On wholesale markets, measures to facilitate raising capital on an EU-wide basis, through common rules concerning prospectuses, is targeted for adoption in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">In addition, legislative proposals on financial statements for listed companies and a common legal framework for a single market for securities and derivatives are close to being adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">We, at the ECB, fully support these initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.43,0)">I would like to stress, however, that the successful and timely implementation of the Financial Services Action Plan will be very difficult without the continuing commitment of the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">The integration of financial markets would not only facilitate cross-border capital flows towards their most productive uses, but it could also serve as a catalyst for structural reform in other markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">For example, the impact of product market reforms, aimed at easing the restrictions on creating a business, are likely to be reinforced if a well-functioning risk capital market, which efficiently channels the necessary funds from investors to beginning entrepreneurs, is in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The euro has made a spectacular impact on financial markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Concrete examples of its impact are the integration of the money market, the explosive growth of the euro-denominated corporate debt market and a wave of consolidation among intermediaries and exchanges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">These are very fundamental changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The surge of euro-denominated corporate debt, for example, has helped to finance the wave of mergers and acquisitions in the European corporate sector and shows how a larger and deeper single financial market can help to strengthen Europe's competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Product markets Let me now turn to product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The pace of liberalisation has differed considerably across countries and sectors in the euro area, leaving ample room for further reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.64,0)">Whereas the integration of goods markets is relatively advanced, shortcomings still exist with regard to the integration of service industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Most of the barriers to integration in the service sector appear to be due to national regulations, for example administrative procedures for setting up subsidiaries in other euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Regulatory barriers along these lines reduce competition in services, thus keeping prices above the level that would be expected in a fully integrated market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">More progress has been made with regard to the integration of goods markets and regulatory reforms in network industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Here too, positive macroeconomic effects can be discerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.81,0)">Owing to an increased number of competitors, prices in some network industries, such telecommunications, have started to decline, in particular in those industries and countries which liberalised earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The initiatives in the telecommunication sector show how reforms that succeed in increasing competition in previously sheltered sectors considerably enhance productivity and lower prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">As network industries provide inputs to the rest of the economy, this may also increase the rate at which the economy can grow without creating inflationary pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Nevertheless, an important unfinished agenda remains to be tackled in almost all network industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">In order to reap the full economic benefits, it is important that reforms in network industries are accompanied by an appropriate regulatory framework which ensures non-discriminatory access to the bottleneck infrastructure and more generally, a "level playing field" for all market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.06,0)">The quality of the regulatory framework has a considerable impact on the extent to which potential price falls due to structural reforms in network industries will be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Another instrument available to reduce distortions to competition is state aid policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.44,0)">State aid subsidies weaken the incentives for companies to improve their efficiency, enabling the less efficient to survive at the expense of the more efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.6,0)">Although there are still substantial differences between euro area countries, the overall trend is towards a reduction in state aid levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Another positive development is that the transparency of state aid policies has improved as a result of the publication of a new state aid register and a state aid scoreboard by the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The impact of the euro on these processes, which has led to more competition, cannot be overestimated and goes far beyond the mere abolition of intra-European exchange rates and the introduction of common notes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The single currency opens up the euro area product markets further and will be a major impetus to competition and integration by increasing the transparency of prices across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Investment will also benefit as euro area companies no longer have to insure against exchange rate movements within the euro area and there are indeed indications that direct investment into the euro area has strongly increased since the start of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Overall, the euro will give new impetus to the initiatives taken in the 1980s to establish a truly integrated internal market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Labour markets Progress with labour market reforms has become evident from the increase in employment-intensive growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">It is very interesting to note that job creation has held up reasonably well over recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.82,0)">During the first three years of EMU, some 6 million jobs have been created in the euro area versus 3.5 million in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.37,0)">The unemployment rate in the euro area has declined from almost 11% in 1997 to slightly more than 8% in 2001  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">On the supply side, the employment rate, particularly in the case of women, has increased considerably, along with the proportion of part-time jobs and temporary contracts in total employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.5,0)">Euro area average participation rates are, nevertheless, still below those of the US or the Scandinavian countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.4,0)">The explanations for this job-rich growth lie in structural changes in the labour market and wage moderation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Government policies have generally improved labour market performance in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.05,0)">A number of countries have lowered marginal tax rates in order to make their tax systems more employment-friendly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.94,0)">Many countries have targeted tax cuts at the lower end of the labour market in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">These measures have contributed to a higher demand for low-skilled workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Nevertheless, marginal tax rates still remain high in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Some progress has also been made with the introduction of part-time or more flexible working contracts and practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In addition to government policies, there are signs of a gradual change in labour market behaviour related to the wage formation process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Discipline seems to have improved in that field over the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Such a change, resulting from lower inflation expectations, is important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.63,0)">Furthermore, there seems to be a growing awareness that, in a single currency environment, the price increases and loss of competitiveness generated by excessive wage settlements cannot be compensated by an exchange rate depreciation and may directly result in a loss of jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Looking ahead, it is crucial that social partners continue to adhere to moderate wage developments, since this is one of the prerequisites in fostering employment and maintaining a favourable outlook for price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.07,0)">In this respect, there is some cause for concern with regard to ongoing wage negotiations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The wage formation process also seems to have undergone changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">In a majority of euro area countries, there are signs of a gradual trend towards more decentralised bargaining and more flexibility at lower bargaining levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.68,0)">This seems to happen, mostly informally, through clauses that allow firms to deviate from the sectoral or central wage agreements according to the financial situation of the firm or sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">This is encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The outcomes of wage bargaining should allow not only for appropriate wage developments in the overall economy, but also for adequate wage differentiation across sectors, regions and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This will make it easier to account for local conditions, such as unemployment, productivity or profitability differentials across sectors, regions and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">In short, labour market reforms have, in general, been going in the right direction in recent years and the benefits of these positive developments are clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.87,0)">However, progress has been rather uneven across countries and areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In many areas important reforms have not yet got off the ground.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.61,0)">For instance, few changes have been made regarding employment protection policies in euro area countries, which remain amongst the strictest in the industrial countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.56,0)">Furthermore, in almost all euro area countries, reforms targeting unemployment benefit systems have only made slow progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.42,0)">At the same time, significant mismatches between labour demand and supply are still present along a number of dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.79,0)">All this shows that large structural problems remain and need to be solved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">What needs to be done to speed up labour market reforms?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.35,0)">This is a difficult question, not least because the euro area labour markets are still very heterogeneous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Each country should identify the root causes of its labour market deficiencies and implement appropriate corrective measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">However, there are some areas of reform that apply to many, if not all, euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Improved job mediation, education and training, to mention just a few examples, all help towards making the matching process more efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In addition, euro area countries need to ensure that tax and benefit systems make work pay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Reforms to tax and benefit systems should increase work incentives, profitability and competitiveness and consequently labour supply and demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">At the same time, it is important to ensure that tax-benefit reforms are undertaken without jeopardising the long-term sustainability of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and Gentlemen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Joseph Schumpeter taught us that economic development consists of the continuous introduction of new combinations of products and means of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.99,0)">He taught us that this process involves the incessant mutation of the economic structure from within, destroying the old and creating a new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In today's dynamic, ever-changing economic environment, entrepreneurs have to be all the more innovative and sensitive to new opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">The regulatory framework has to be designed in such a way that it allows this to happen by providing the right incentives for innovation, dynamism and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Today's dynamic society also requires an increased ability of markets to adjust smoothly to changing economic circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.61,0)">This is all the more true of a monetary union, where member countries are no longer able to use country-specific monetary and exchange rate policies to address country-specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In such an environment, other adjustment mechanisms are needed such as price and wage flexibility and factor mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Structural reforms can contribute to a better functioning of these adjustment mechanisms by fostering integration and competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The relationship between integration, competition and the single currency works in both directions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The euro itself has already contributed to more integration and competition and will continue to do so in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Its impact is most clearly visible in financial markets, where a single money market has been created and a deep, liquid bond market has encouraged a surge in debt issuance by the corporate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In product markets, the euro has an important impact on the cross-border transparency of prices, acting as a catalyst for trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Finally, with regard to labour markets, the wage formation process shows signs of increased flexibility and labour market reforms are starting to go in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Overall, the single currency contributes forcefully to more integration and competition, acting as a powerful driver for the further enhancement of the Single Market and creating an environment which – I am sure – Schumpeter would have enjoyed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
