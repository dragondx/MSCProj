    <span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)"> Cyber resilience – objectives and tools Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the first meeting of the Euro Cyber Resilience Board for pan-European Financial Infrastructures, Frankfurt am Main, 9 March 2018 In 1903, the Italian inventor Marconi demonstrated his new invention, a wireless telegraph, to a large audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.43,0)">It didn’t go too well for him, though.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The machine itself did work in the sense that it transmitted a message.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.92,0)">However, it was not the message the audience – or Marconi – had expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.34,0)">The word “rats” was being sent again and again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.22,0)">The system had been hacked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.48,0)">The culprit in this case was Nevil Maskelyne, a magician.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.57,0)">Allegedly, he had been hired by a British wired-telegraph company which was worried that Marconi’s invention might ruin its business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Technology has advanced a lot since 1903.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">And it has created a deeply interconnected world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The financial system is a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.0,0)">No financial institution can survive, let alone thrive, on its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">No bank can do without the complex web of financial market infrastructures that underpins its day-to-day business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.82,0)">No bank, therefore, must underestimate the associated risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In particular, no bank must underestimate the IT risks, which include cyber risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.33,0)">In the worst case, a single hack could compromise the entire system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">So cyber resilience is a goal we all share.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.07,0)">And anyone who sees it as just another competitive advantage is mistaken; the whole chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.5,0)">And in that sense, many actors in the financial system are parts of the same chain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">ECB Banking Supervision takes cyber resilience very seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Naturally, we focus on banks and on the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In doing so, we take into account that banks are not just connected among themselves but also with other market participants and infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This means that our supervision of IT risks also covers the end-points of payment systems and market infrastructures in the banks directly supervised by us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In short, we aim to ensure the availability, confidentiality and integrity of banks’ data and systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">What have we done so far and what are our plans for the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">So far, we have conducted thematic reviews on cyber risk and outsourcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">One result is stating the obvious: there is some concentration in terms of companies to which banks outsource IT functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Apart from concrete bank-specific findings, the reviews have helped us to get a better idea of the risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">And they have made banks more aware of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We have conducted a stocktake on how IT risks are supervised outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">This helped us to identify best practices; and it will help us to define our own supervisory expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Work is ongoing as part of our contribution to the work programme of the European Banking Authority, the EBA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">We have conducted quite a few on-site inspections into IT and cyber risks, using state-of-the-art methods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Looking ahead, our aim would be to have such inspections every three or four years for large banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We have set up a reporting framework for cyber incidents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.49,0)">Since mid-2017, banks have been required to report significant cyber incidents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This will help us to quickly react in a crisis and make us aware of common vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Drawing on guidelines from the EBA, we have developed comprehensive IT risk self-assessments for the banks we supervise, including an extensive section on IT and cyber security.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The results of these assessments will feed into our Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process, in which we will also challenge the information provided by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">We will do so as a result of our insights from on-site inspections and from reports of cyber incidents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The information collected will then serve as a basis for a thematic review of IT risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This review will give us a better idea of the overall IT risk landscape in the banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">It will allow us to identify blind spots early on and define areas which we need to investigate further; this will eventually feed into our plans for 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">In addition, the review will also help us to compare banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Partially anonymised feedback could then be shared with them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, there is one thing we need to keep in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Right from the start, hacks gained a lot of attention, while preventing them did not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.36,0)">In finance, as in many other fields, it is mostly just mundane work that helps to keep things safe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.48,0)">I wonder whether cyber risk is as unique as we are inclined to believe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">I have no doubt that we need to take it seriously and that we need to work towards making banks more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">In doing so, we should also welcome new ways of tackling cyber risk, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But this I would like to do within the existing framework of banks’ risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Cyber risk needs to be part of general risk management procedures, of general crisis management, and general business continuity planning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.08,0)">After all, it is an operational risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">And our experience in dealing with operational risks can help us to cope with cyber risk as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We must keep in mind that cyber risk does not invariably arise from the technology itself but also from how we use it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.64,0)">It is people who are behind the hacking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.02,0)">And often, it is people who leave doors unlocked and gates wide open for cyber criminals to sneak in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">People play a big role when it comes to cyber resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Thus, it makes sense to draw on the principles we have established for risk management and governance, and on the experience we have gained in these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, I am aware that this kind of work is unlikely to capture the public’s attention in the same way as Mr Maskelyne did in 1903.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But it needs to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">While cybercrime may have an aura of mystery and power, cyber resilience is quite the opposite: it calls for vigilance and diligence, day in, day out.</span>
