    <span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)"> The role of Europe in global rebalancing Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB,at the Expert Seminar "Asia's role in the Global Economy Forum" organised by Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum  ,Singapore, 12 July 2013 Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank OMFIF, particularly David Marsh, as well as all the organisers of this Conference for inviting me to address you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.64,0)">In discussions on global economic imbalances, the euro area often played a secondary role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.98,0)">Academic debates about global imbalances prior to the crisis typically involved the United States and Asia, with the euro area largely excluded as its aggregate current account was broadly in balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And looking ahead, on the face of it, the same story is largely true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.99,0)">The policy debate is focused on how the global situation will develop in the presence of two counter-veiling forces: the United States likely moving away from its traditional role as the global “spender of last resort”; and external surplus economies, notably in Asia, still largely relying on an export-based growth model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The euro area, running a non-significant current account surplus, is seen as a largely neutral force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.48,0)">But this does not mean that what happens in the euro area is irrelevant for other regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.52,0)">Naturally, the euro area banking and sovereign debt crises have been a cause of concern for the world economy from the perspective of growth prospects and as a possible source of financial turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">And the international cooperation that is so vital for the health of the world economy implies that the three regions should achieve their internal balance with growth and low unemployment, maintaining at the same time a long term situation close to external balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In the present globalized economy this cannot be achieved without cooperation on their macroeconomic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.18,0)">Any set of policies implemented by the US, Europe and Asia that does not consistently corrects global macroeconomic imbalances is not sustainable and could lead to new crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">What I would like to do in my remarks today is to emphasise two specific channels where developments in the euro area could have an important impact on the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Channel one: rebalancing towards sustainable growth The first channel is related to the structural adjustment taking place within euro area economies which could, in time, correct the imbalances internal to the euro area thus overcoming a major European vulnerability allowing Europe to make a contribution to global demand and hence global rebalancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Euro area countries are currently taking a series of policy measures both to raise their growth potential and to make growth more sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">They are achieving greater sustainability by moving towards an economic model based less on external borrowing and more on internal competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Indeed, according to harmonised competitiveness indicators based on unit labour costs have all registered significant improvements since 1999, Ireland  , Spain  , Greece  , and Portugal  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.37,0)">The loss of competitiveness accumulated until 2007 has been totally offset since the beginning of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.31,0)">As a consequence, the EU Commission forecast for this year is that all stressed countries will show a surplus on current account with the exception of Greece with a deficit of just 1.1 % of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">And euro area countries are increasing their growth-potential by implementing wide-ranging structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">These include product and labour market measures, but also deeper reforms to tax systems, public administration and the judicial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Our monetary policy has been helping this process by improving our transmission mechanism and stabilizing markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The decision taken last year on the programme of Outright Monetary Transactions   has been decisive in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Our recent decision to provide forward guidance regarding our main policy rate was also successful in stabilizing financial markets unduly affected be spillovers from the recent FED announcement of future tapering of Quantitative Easing  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Europe is behind the US in economic recovery and inflation risks which implies that monetary policy has to stay accommodative for a longer period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Our forward guidance is in line with our policy framework as it does not refer to any date or period of time but is instead totally conditional on developments in inflation prospects, in the economy and in money and credit aggregates – the pillars of out monetary strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">At the same time, policy measures are underway at the European level that could help expedite this rebalancing process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">These include initiatives by the European Investment Bank to boost lending to SMEs, and the possible introduction of contractual programmes with financial incentives to underpin structural reform implementation in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">A proposal by the European Commission on the latter is expected before the end of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Channel two: a stable financial system through Banking Union The second channel through which euro area developments can have a global impact is the process of building a genuine Banking Union in order to ensure a robust banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">As research by for example Borio and Distayat   and Hyun Song Shin   has shown, developments in Europe were very relevant to global capital flow constellations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Looking at gross rather than net capital flows, financial intermediaries in Europe were by far the most important source of capital flows into the US, not emerging markets as the “global savings glut” theory suggests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Even today, the total stock of euro area bonds and equities currently held by US investors is worth around 1 trillion euro, while euro area investors hold US bonds and equities worth more than 2 trillion dollars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.21,0)">All this means that the situation of the financial sector in Europe has major spillovers for the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">And therefore the process of stabilising and strengthening the European banking sector, which Banking Union represents, has very important international implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me now speak about this in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.8,0)">The situation of the euro area banking sector It has become fashionable for commentators to paint a picture of the euro area banking sector as a source of persistent financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.03,0)">The common theme is that euro area banks are undercapitalised with potential losses still to be recognized.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">I do not deny that there still problems to be addressed as I will explain later in my remarks but looking at the more recent data, the situation of European banks is better than present market perceptions and better than what many observers acknowledge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">First, there have been steady improvements in solvency positions of many euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">For large and complex banking groups in the euro area, covering about two thirds of total assets, the median core Tier 1 capital ratio reached 11.1% in the first quarter of this year – up from 9.6% at the end of 2011 and 8.3% at end-2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Second, euro area large banks have become less leveraged, from a level of 3,3 % of tier 1 equity to 5% now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">This was achieved mainly through capital increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This point is well illustrated in a recent speech by Thomas Hoenig  , FDIC Vice Chairman.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Indeed, he reports that the bigger US banks show a leverage ratio of tangible equity over tangible total assets of 6.2%, using US accounting standards  , whereas the main European Banks have a level of 3.7% when using IFRS accounting standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.51,0)">However, according to FDIC calculations, if the US banks ratio would be calculated according to IFRS, the same as in Europe, the ratio comes down to 3.8% very similar to the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">When calculated with the same accounting standards the average leverage ratios of the large American and European banks are quite similar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.23,0)">The explanation for this has to do with netting rules: under the US GAAP the American banks have total assets of 10 trillion dollars but applying IFRS that is changed into 16 trillion dollars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.46,0)">This huge difference explains the difference in the leverage ratios but, importantly, has necessarily to impact also the published risk-weighted capital ratios of European and American banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.61,0)">This means that the capital ratios are then not comparable although that is many times ignored by market and media perceptions, clearly to the detriment of European banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Third, the restructuring efforts in the stressed countries to strengthen their banks with the help of the European Stability Mechanism   funds have led to improved funding conditions for euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">With the financing provided by the ESM, banks in Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland have been recapitalized.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.6,0)">Bank deposits in these countries have risen by around 200 bn since September last year, and the cost of both deposit and bond funding for banks has fallen significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Euro area banks’ issuance of medium and long-term debt has increased and we have also seen a noticeable pick-up in repo market activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.0,0)">All these changes have led to lower use of central bank liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Hundreds of banks have made use of the option to repay the liquidity provided through the ECB’s three-year longer-term refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">These repayments amount to some €300 billion, more than half of the net liquidity injection of 500 bn, provided by our two big LTRO operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.11,0)">Our lending to bank counterparties has declined from 14% of the Euro Area GDP at the peak to around 8% today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.88,0)">Despite these positive trends, there is still a negative perception in the market about European banks and more measures are indeed necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.39,0)">The fact that improved bank fundamentals have not been translated into higher price-to-book ratios tells us that there is a confidence problem as regards euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.44,0)">And if this is left unaddressed, it risks creating a vicious circle as a low price-to-book ratio means that it is expensive for banks to issue equity, which might impinge on their ability to raise capital through financial market channels in a cost-effective way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">Towards Banking Union This is where Banking Union comes in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The transposition to the European level of financial sector policies through building a strong Banking Union can play a pivotal role in rebuilding trust in the euro area banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Banking Union has for now two key components: the Single Supervisory Mechanism   and the Single Resolution Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The creation of a European Deposit Guarantee Scheme which the third component has been postponed for the medium term The creation of the SSM, which we expect to be operational next year, should increase confidence in the euro area banking sector through two main channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">First, the SSM will provide reassurance to investors that supervision is consistent and effective across all participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The SSM will operate as a single system, with a common supervisory manual applying to all participating banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The ECB will directly supervise large, systemically relevant banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">While it would be inefficient for the ECB to supervise directly the thousands of remaining smaller banks, we will have the authority to take over supervision of any small bank or group of banks at any moment if deemed necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This means there will be no “blind spots” from which financial instability could emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Second, the implementation of the SSM should reduce concerns about hidden losses on banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In accordance with the SSM regulation, the ECB will conduct a “comprehensive assessment, including a balance-sheet assessment” of all banks supervised directly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This will apply to around 130 banking groups operating in the euro area, which account for around 85% of euro area banking assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The assessment will involve a Balance Sheet Assessment including an Asset Quality Review to be conducted by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This will then feed into the overall stress test to be conducted by EBA, in cooperation with the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The results of both exercises should be ready before we start actually supervising the banks next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">We want this assessment to be as rigorous as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Consequently, we are prepared for the fact that it may reveal capital needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">If so, the first responsibility is for banks to raise capital themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But there may be a public dimension as well, which is why the European Council on 27-28 June addressed the need for backstops to be in place before the exercise is completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.1,0)">Without these financial backstops being in place the ECB does not advice to complete the whole set of balance sheet assessment and stress tests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.61,0)">However, investors will not be fully confident in the euro area unless they believe that banks can fail without causing financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.79,0)">Otherwise, they will expect supervisors to practice forbearance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This is why the SSM needs to be accompanied by a Single Resolution Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The European Commission announced last Wednesday a proposal for a Single Resolution Mechanism based on the concept of a an agency with wide of autonomy and ultimately dependent on the Commission for the crucial decision of putting a bank into resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Different alternative institutional setups could be conceived but the existence of a SRM is a key priority for Europe and I am very pleased to see in the proposal that the envisaged timeline takes this into account, with the entry into force foreseen for mid-2014 and operations commencing in January 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This aligns with the entry into force in 2015 of the new legal framework for resolution in Europe, the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive  , which will provide a harmonised framework of resolution powers and tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">While it is still too early to provide an in-depth assessment of the Commission proposal and a more detailed assessment will be published in our ECB legal opinion, I would like to welcome, from a personal point of view, some important points contained in the Commission`s proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">First, the Authority will have the capacity for truly European decision-making with no veto powers for national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">In my view this is key for dealing swiftly and impartially with large cross-border banks, although the proposal appropriately applies to all banks of the participating countries in the Single Supervisory Mechanism, thus ensuring a cohesive system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Second, the Authority would own a Single Resolution Fund which would be financed by ex ante risk based contributions to be complemented by ex post contributions both paid inby the industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Although not specified, the proposal stipulates that the Fund would be able to borrow from both private and public alternative funding means.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">These borrowings would subsequently recouped from the industry, thus ensuring fiscal neutrality in the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I would have preferred, however, that the proposal would have considered explicitly the issue of a public backstop for the resolution fund in the form of a credit line that would have to be repaid afterwards, as it is the case with the US FDIC.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The ECB has strongly advocated for an SRM comprising of these three elements: a single system, a single authority, and a single fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The proposal contains these three elements and consequently reduces the harmful effects of sovereign-bank interactions by diminishing the importance of implicit sovereign guarantees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The SRM will operate in the legal framework established by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive  , which was recently agreed by Member States’ Governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This Directive foresees that bail-in becomes the first line of defence in dealing with banking crisis – indeed, 8% of liabilities will have to be bailed-in before resolution funds or other public funds can be used, with depositors of persons and SME being given the highest preference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Nevertheless, the full bail-in tools that includes the possibility of burning senior bank bonds and uninsured deposits will entry into force only at the end of 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.62,0)">Before that date only shareholders capital and subordinated debt can be used to resolve a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.04,0)">Insured deposits, secured borrowing   are exempt from bail-in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">I think that the bail-in principles approved by the Member States and the respective timeline until 2018 are appropriate to allow a transition period that is helpful to ensure stability in the bank bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">This new rules should support the work of the SSM by strengthening incentives in the financial sector to exercise market discipline on problematic banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">To sum up, the euro area banking sector is becoming more stable overall, and given the euro area’s central role in global financial intermediation, this creates positive spillovers for the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Banking Union will take this process forward by increasing confidence in supervision and ensuring that banks that need to be wound down, can be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">To the extent that this supports credit growth to the private sector, this will also generate higher growth in the euro area and help the global economy through that channel, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Conclusion Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.9,0)">Advanced economies, Europe in particular, face a long period of slow growth that will test the quality of our institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The European social compact will have to prove its adaptability and resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.42,0)">The Euro Area is still facing a painful crisis of imbalances, financial fragmentation and low growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.39,0)">Questions of excess inequalities and high unemployment will have to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Meanwhile the world will continue to march towards the Great Convergence cogently described by Kishore Mahbubani in his latest book.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">To fulfil its role in the process, Europe is addressing its structural problems which have been holding back growth and at the same time it is ensuring that its banking sector contributes to global stability and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Europe is undertaking a process of wide and deep reforms, of which the Banking Union project is a major example, that will ensure a future healthier path of economic progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">As someone said, “a crisis is a terrible thing to waste” – and we are using this crisis to build a stronger and more stable monetary union that will play a constructive part in global rebalancing.</span>
