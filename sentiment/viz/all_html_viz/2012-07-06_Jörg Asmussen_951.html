    <h3> Speaker: Jörg Asmussen </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> Building trust in a world of unknown unknowns: central bank communication between markets and politics in the crisis Speech by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, European Communication Summit 2012, Brussels, 6 July 2012 Ladies and Gentlemen, It has been said that “there have been three great inventions since the beginning of time: fire, the wheel, and central banking   ”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Central banking has become my business since January this year, but I feel I am getting my fair share of the other two as well: being behind the steering wheel of the ECB during this crisis turned out to be in the line of fire.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">You invited a central banker to speak at this year’s European Communication Summit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Thank you for giving me the opportunity to share some thoughts with you on a very relevant topic: central bank communication in the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Communication is an essential and powerful policy tool of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.33,0)">This is because the physical “product” of a modern central bank is something with little intrinsic worth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.35,0)">The euros in our pockets are, after all, only pieces of printed paper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Their value lies in the shared conviction that this so-called fiat money can be used as a means of exchange, as a unit of account and above all as a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">“All money is a matter of belief   ”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This belief stands and falls with the credibility and trustworthiness of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This, in turn, rests on its words and deeds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Maintaining this trust is an enormous responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Consistent communication and policy action can create confidence and popular support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.93,0)">By contrast, miscommunication and policy mistakes can create excessive volatility in markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.31,0)">In extreme cases, the currency itself may be at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">And with it the value of the peoples’ savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.08,0)">It was not always obvious that central banks and communication should be mentioned in the same sentence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.44,0)">Central banks used to be secretive places.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.46,0)">They used to surprise the markets with their policy moves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.46,0)">They used a language that made the oracle of Delphi appear positively accessible: Alan Greenspan is on record as saying: “If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said   .” Those days are over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Central bank communication has become a very dynamic discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.43,0)">By deliberately steering expectations in financial markets with their communication, central banks let the markets do part of the job of transmitting their policy signals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.34,0)">The crisis was a game-changer in the communication of central banks, and of economic policy makers more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.81,0)">In this world of unknown unknowns, and rapid shifts market sentiment, our task has become much more complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The new challenges can be captured by the following three themes, or fault lines: First: market communication versus political communication; Second: transmitting the message versus facing the discourse Third: arguing with counterfactuals and navigating the short versus the long term I will address each of those in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Market communication vs political communication; In the “old” days, central bank communication was focused on a specific target audience: financial markets, specialised financial media, interested academic circles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It was an ‘insiders’ community’, speaking an expert language.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.14,0)">Anyone who listened to speeches of central bankers on the economic outlook and the course of monetary policy knows what I mean: they were deliberately unexciting, technical and repetitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">But this type of communication inspired confidence: there was a consistent message and a steady hand at the tiller.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The importance of the consistency of the messages across time, countries and media outlets remains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But the context has changed fundamentally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.04,0)">During this crisis, central bankers and policy-makers are faced with a potentially explosive interplay between markets and politics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.48,0)">Messages that are necessary and legitimate in public debates can be completely unsuited for market communication and exacerbate tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">In Spring 2010, Angela Merkel addressed the German Bundestag to persuade lawmakers to approve the financial assistance programme for Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.21,0)">She had to engage in a profoundly political discourse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">She employed all tools of rhetoric.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.49,0)">And she justified her appeal by declaring that “the future of the euro is at stake”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.9,0)">This was legitimate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">However, in financial markets across the globe, that very same message popped up on traders’ screens as a one-liner: “Merkel questions survival of single currency”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.84,0)">If you were a trader, what would you do?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.81,0)">The rest is history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.83,0)">One and the same message is received very differently by different audiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.73,0)">But those audiences cannot be separated easily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.57,0)">“Political” communication and the processing of this information in nervous and fragile markets has been a major factor that exacerbated and propagated the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We still do not have an answer how best to bridge this gap: on the one hand, we must not suffocate open debate in our democracies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.78,0)">We cannot muzzle the public discourse to impose conformity with the needs of nervous markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.4,0)">At the same time, undisciplined and irresponsible communication has real, costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Maybe one way forward would be to emphasise that markets should listen to the right kind of statements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">If it concerns the euro area as a whole, it is the voices of the supranational level that should count.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Markets should also concentrate on what is actually being said by policy-makers, rather than how this is being interpreted by analysts, commentators and the media.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.23,0)">The constant extrapolation of what current policy decisions “could” or “are likely” to imply under extreme scenarios sows the seeds of volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.84,0)">The focus on what might happen in case of catastrophic tail-events diverts attention from already achieved or agreed policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">A second aspect of the “brave new world” of communication is the urgent need to communicate beyond the specialist “insider’s circle”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Central banks have to actively communicate with the broader public, for three reasons: First, what used to be obscure and complex issue for monetary policy specialists are now mainstream news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.28,0)">Two years ago, few people had heard of central bank operations or intra-Eurosystem payment flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.57,0)">These days, television talk shows debate the ECB’s long-term refinancing operations or TARGET2-balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The people have a legitimate interest and a right to get information and explanation directly from us, rather than via intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.78,0)">Second, in all of this, we are faced with the inevitable tendency to reduce complexity and simplify the message.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.57,0)">This is what the media are supposed to do: “First simplify, then exaggerate!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">” Simplification is, of course, legitimate – and also needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But exaggeration is not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.11,0)">It risks skewing perceptions and distorting the true picture of the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.47,0)">Take, for instance, the situation in Ireland or Portugal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.05,0)">This requires comprehensive and in-depth understanding – an analyst’s two-pager often cannot do justice to this complexity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">By sharing and explaining its own assessment, the central bank can contribute to a more balanced debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Third, during the crisis, the ECB has undertaken extraordinary measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">It has provided 1 trillion euro in liquidity to the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">It contributes to the design of adjustment programmes for countries receiving EU-IMF assistance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It is part of the Troika going on country missions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It offers advice on the future evolution of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.8,0)">Some criticise us for this, some claim that we go beyond our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.84,0)">Those criticisms must not go unanswered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Adding complexity to an already complex situation is the fact that the ECB communicates in a multi-lingual, multicultural context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.04,0)">One and the same message, even if translated perfectly into the 23 official EU languages, may cause very different public and market reactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">But extraordinary actions call for extraordinary efforts to explain them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.68,0)">This brings me to my second point: Transmitting the message versus facing the discourse In the past, central bank communication was mainly a one-way street.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.82,0)">The central bank transmits its messages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.45,0)">As independent institutions, they were – and continue to be – prohibited from yielding to outside influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And rightfully so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.09,0)">The first President of the ECB, Wim Duisenberg, summed it up very neatly: “I hear, but I do not listen   .” The academic debate about central bank communication focused on transparency: Whether central banks were too closed and provided too little information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The globalisation of information, the rise of the internet and the new “prominence” of central bank action create a new context: whatever the central bank does is subject to a worldwide market assessment and media commentary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.44,0)">In blogs and internet comments, via Twitter, on TV channels and in traditional print media, central banks are faced with a barrage of outside opinion that has a powerful impact on public discourse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.03,0)">Professors, Nobel Prize winners, analysts, chief economists, innumerable experts, any individual posting comments on the internet: they all present their analysis and opinion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In many cases, there is thoughtful analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.46,0)">In some cases, opinionated polemics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.47,0)">But in almost all cases, they know better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.16,0)">The concepts they use, the solutions they propose and the policy actions they call for – all this shapes the public discourse, and one way or another also influences policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The difference is that commentators do not need to assume the responsibility for the recommended actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.7,0)">Policy-makers have to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.36,0)">Let me give you an example: last year, a debate was raging about the size of the European financial assistance facilities, the so-called “Eurozone firewall”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.79,0)">None of the very substantial amounts seemed to be enough: the 500 billion euro that were already on the table, and used to only a very small extent, were decried as insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">One trillion euro at least, if not two trillion or more, were seen as necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">One idea pushed forcefully by the “international expert opinion” was to “leverage” existing funds, by offering incentives to private and public entities to provide additional funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">And indeed, throngs of European officials worked night and day to devise and agree on two options to leverage the European Financial Stability Facility  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Today the two instruments are there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">They could work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.39,0)">Will they ever be used?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.96,0)">The caravan of the “commentariat” had already moved on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.09,0)">No-one speaks about leveraging the EFSF anymore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.82,0)">In fact, the actual investors in EFSF bonds were put off by the leveraging options, because it made the EFSF structure more risky and less understandable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.19,0)">The searchlight of attention of the markets and the commentary shifts fast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.38,0)">Yesterday it was the firewalls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Then it was growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.39,0)">Today it is Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">For sure, all of these issues require action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But designing and agreeing on responses takes time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.09,0)">No wonder that policy-makers are criticised for constantly being “behind the curve”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Markets want to see immediate and forceful action from Europe’s politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.83,0)">And their criticism of the slowness of the European crisis response is in part justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.21,0)">But democratic politics takes time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.07,0)">It is open, noisy, and messy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.81,0)">We cannot do “crisis management by Politburo”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">We need effective communication and a proper public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">This is especially true for the envisaged next steps towards deeper integration in Eurozone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.43,0)">Why am I telling you this?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Because it sheds light on the nexus between a new class of opinion formers, financial markets and policy outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.79,0)">For the euro area and the ECB, the situation is even more peculiar, because the influential “commentariat” comes predominantly from outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.42,0)">The big English-language newspapers, the news agencies and wire services that shape opinions in the economic and financial sphere on the Continent are all writing from outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There is, of course, nothing wrong with friendly outside advice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.22,0)">And I certainly do not wish to come across as whining and complaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.84,0)">But it simply remains a fact: the analysis, discourse and policy prescriptions that are propagated come from the outside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.34,0)">Maybe inevitably, they come with a certain disinterested detachment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.27,0)">As if the outside “spectators” are not affected by what is happening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.38,0)">And they come with a dangerously narrow and exclusive perspective on the economics of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.26,0)">But if the profound political commitment of Eurozone countries to the historical project of “ever closer union” is neglected, the assessment remains superficial and partial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.22,0)">And the suggested policy responses may be biased or naïve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.51,0)">Why does it matter?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Because the discourse influences some of the most important financial markets for the Eurozone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.43,0)">If expectations that have been built up are not fulfilled, if alleged certainties do not materialise, if actions from politicians or central bankers are not forthcoming as anticipated by the “market consensus”, the reaction can be grave: volatility, contagion, all the way to complete market dysfunction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.47,0)">The systemic impact can be major, driving financial institutions, as well as sovereign borrowers into real difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.39,0)">The result is a situation where policy-makers – including the central bank – may feel compelled to react to market developments with ever more powerful responses, in order to contain the a systemic risk and avoid a meltdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.06,0)">What is the lesson?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.18,0)">Central banks have to face up to the public and market discourse – especially because they are independent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We have to participate in this debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">We have to take on the critics, understand their points, and argue our case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">We have to listen, explain, and convince.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Naturally, we will ultimately do what we judge to be the correct cause of action, in full independence and in line with our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.89,0)">Actions speak louder than words.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Especially when they are timely, measured and effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This is what creates confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Precisely for that reason, financial markets, as well as politicians, have been looking to the ECB as a kind of “saviour of last resort”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.87,0)">This creates maybe an even bigger communication challenge: we must explain what the limits of our powers and mandate are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.05,0)">The ECB cannot compensate for what others – notably political authorities – fail to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.96,0)">There is no substitute for good policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.27,0)">Saying this is not always popular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">But “to be trusted is a greater compliment than being loved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.39,0)">” When market pundits forecast the “inevitable”, they insinuate a degree of certainty about the future which is simply not there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This brings me to my last point – how to deal with uncertainty, with a world of unknown unknowns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And how to communicate when everyone asks “what if”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Arguing with counterfactuals and navigating the short versus the long term During this crisis, the ECB has taken a number of non-standard measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.11,0)">They were, by definition, out of the ordinary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But they were motivated by the need to prevent a catastrophe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">What we did, we justified with respect to an intangible counter-factual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.73,0)">With respect to history that did not happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.72,0)">Doing so can be extraordinarily difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me give you an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.38,0)">Back in November 2011, we were faced with acute tensions in financial markets; entire market segments had become dysfunctional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.85,0)">The danger of a credit crunch was real.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.43,0)">There was an anticipation of an inevitable catastrophe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">You may remember the headlines: “The euro has a 50% chance of making it to Christmas   ”, or “Ten days to save the eurozone   ”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">The announcement of our long-term refinancing operations was a sentiment changer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.03,0)">The feared severe credit crunch has not materialised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The euro is still here – and here to stay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.53,0)">But the question “what if the ECB had not acted” remains unanswered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.52,0)">There is no evidence what would have happened in such a counterfactual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.3,0)">This makes justifying our action with reference to such a counterfactual an uphill struggle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.76,0)">The uncertainty embedded in the “what if” question is exacerbated by the discontinuity between the short term and the longer term in the interaction between markets and policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Markets mainly focus on the immediate future; on the emergency measures to fight the crisis: here, a central bank can be very effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The ECB can change the market situation within minutes, by adjusting its interest rate, market interventions if needed, adapting its collateral rules, or simply communicating its assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This creates certainty, for now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.24,0)">However, for the longer-term, considerable uncertainty remains: short-term fixes do not change the structural features of European economies and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Those depend on the countries’ economic policies, which take time to design and implement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Firm commitments from governments can help reduce this uncertainty, but can never eliminate it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.05,0)">The trade-off between the short term and the long term creates a fundamental communication challenge for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.49,0)">If short-term crisis fighting is successful, for instance through ECB actions, some of the longer term challenges might never be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.39,0)">The immediate pressure subsides, and incentives for governments weaken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">More than once did we witness this during this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.81,0)">By contrast, if the fire-fighting in the short-term does not succeed, there may not be a longer term to think about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Our communication is walking a tightrope: markets need reassurance that the ECB will do what is within its power and mandate to guarantee that the euro will not to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">At the same time, governments need to have the right incentives to tackle the longer-term challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.5,0)">Conclusion Ladies and Gentlemen The crisis was a game changer in the communication of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.7,0)">Navigating between markets and politics has shifted the goalposts of the ECB’s communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We are facing up to this new environment and its challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">We are engaging more.</span><span
