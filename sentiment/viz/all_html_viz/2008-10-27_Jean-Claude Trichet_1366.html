    <span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)"> Current challenges for the euro area Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB“Lunchtime discussions” with the Spanish business communityMadrid, 27 October 2008 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank KPMG and Europa Press for inviting me today to share with you some reflections on the current state of the euro area and its future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This summer we celebrated the tenth anniversary of the European Central Bank and of the European System of Central Banks, and next January the euro will be ten years old.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Since the launch of the euro, the average inflation rate in the euro area has been slightly above 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">This record compares favourably with the average inflation rate of 3% that was achieved in the member countries in the previous nine years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The ECB has preserved and made available to all euro area countries the stability and credibility that were the privilege of the most successful legacy currencies to be replaced by the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Our success in delivering low and stable inflation over the last decade is all the more remarkable when one remembers that, in the early years, the project of a single European currency was received with a degree of scepticism by prominent commentators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.53,0)">These critics have clearly been proven wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The euro has rapidly achieved a well-recognised status worldwide as a stable anchor in turbulent times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Far from suppressing growth and entrenching divergences, the euro acts as a vital catalyst for change in the economic landscape of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.9,0)">Nonetheless, there is no place for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Price stability in the medium term has to be permanently ensured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">And the success achieved so far needs to be complemented and consolidated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">For this reason, in the remainder of my talk today I would like to discuss the challenges that the ECB, and the euro area as a whole, face as they enter their second decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I Price stability: current situation and prospects Let me first share with you some reflections on the prospects for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.44,0)">Starting with the current situation, euro area HICP inflation has remained at a high level since last autumn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This spike in euro area HICP inflation had its origins in external forces, in particular the very strong global rise in several commodity prices – notably those of energy and food.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Given the magnitude of these increases in global commodity prices, there has been a sizeable direct pass-through into the food and energy components of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.4,0)">Much of the ongoing inflationary pressure at this stage also derives from the indirect effects on inflation of cost pressures in the production chain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.75,0)">In addition, there is a concern that second-round effects could materialise if consumers or firms attempt to compensate for any loss in purchasing power stemming from the increase in commodity prices by pushing for higher wages or prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Available evidence on price and wage-setting behaviour in the euro area suggests some cause for concern in two respects: First, the indirect impacts on inflation have been strong, given both the scale of the rise in energy and food prices and the fact that these commodities are an extensive input into the production of other goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.45,0)">Strong producer price inflation was not confined to the direct energy and food price components of producer prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Indirect effects have also been visible at the retail level, most notably in areas with a strong link to energy and food prices, such as the transport and restaurant and café components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.08,0)">Ultimately, the extent to which price pressures at early and intermediate stages of production feed through the production chain and up to the retail level crucially depends on the pricing behaviour of firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.87,0)">An important factor here is the extent of competition in product markets, which obviously serves to reduce the pricing power of individual firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Second, labour costs exhibited a clear acceleration in the first half of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.53,0)">A pick-up in the growth rate of wages at a time when labour productivity growth is decelerating has resulted in a significant increase in unit labour costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.93,0)">It is imperative to avoid broad-based second-round effects in wage as well as price-setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.36,0)">In this context, the ECB has repeatedly expressed its concern about the existence of schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.52,0)">Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">As for the prospects for inflation, on the basis of current commodity futures prices the annual HICP inflation rate is likely to remain above a level consistent with price stability for some time, moderating gradually during the course of 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.84,0)">Taking into account the recent substantial decline in commodity prices, together with the substantial weakening in demand which has emerged lately, upside risks to price stability have diminished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.68,0)">Taking this environment into account and, particularly also the fact that inflation expectations have significantly diminished, the Governing Council has decided to diminish rates by 50 basis points on 8th of October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.9,0)">Assuming that the new information which is progressively becoming available since then and until our next meeting, is likely to indicate a further alleviation of the upside risks to price stability in the medium term and a confirmation of the more solid anchoring of inflation expectations in line with our definition of price stability, I consider possible that the Governing Council would decrease interest rates once again at its next meeting on the 6th of November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.4,0)">It is not a certainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.76,0)">It is a possibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.4,0)">If we have decreased rates on the 8th of October it was because upside risks to price stability had diminished and that we were fully confident that the new monetary policy stance would permit us to deliver price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">All our decisions are inspired by this fundamental primary objective: price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Any new monetary policy stance that we could decide on at our next regular monetary policy meeting must continue to allow us to tell our 320 million fellow citizens: “you can be confident.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">We will deliver price stability in line with our definition of less than 2% but close to 2% in the medium term.” II Potential growth, productivity and structural reforms in Europe Let me move on to the growth performance of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.02,0)">Over the short term, annual euro area real GDP growth is expected to slow down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.69,0)">The uncertainty surrounding this outlook is particularly high at the current juncture and, generally, downside risks from the financial market tensions prevail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">However, today I would like to look beyond recent developments in economic activity and discuss growth prospects over the medium and long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.49,0)">I am afraid that prospects for potential output growth over the medium term do not offer a completely reassuring picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.4,0)">Raising potential output growth remains a challenge for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me elaborate on the three main factors underlying trends in real GDP growth: working-age population growth, labour utilisation and labour productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Working-age population growth remains one important factor explaining disparities in real GDP growth between the euro area and the fastest growing industrial economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Over the past 20 years, the average contribution to real GDP growth from growth of the working-age population has been approximately 0.8 percentage point higher in the United States than in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.79,0)">Looking ahead, the euro area faces the prospect of an ageing population, and the labour force could therefore become a strong constraint on the growth potential of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As for labour utilisation, over the past ten years, and despite subdued growth in the population of working age, there has been a strong acceleration in the number of total hours worked in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.07,0)">This stands in contrast to developments in the United States, where a small deceleration has taken place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Much of the euro area acceleration can be explained by enhanced labour utilisation over this period, and the main drivers of this to date can clearly be identified as improvements in participation and employment rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">However, despite this visible progress, there is room for further improvement with regard to the way in which labour markets work in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.29,0)">First, the employment rate in the euro area remains low by international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.11,0)">Second, the unemployment rate is still too high on average in the euro area and especially in certain countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.54,0)">As for labour productivity growth, from a longer-term perspective, developments in the euro area have been characterised by a sustained decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This is in contrast with strong gains in labour productivity in the United States over the past ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This acceleration in US labour productivity was triggered by advances in information and communication technology   during the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">A very favourable regulatory environment, continued investment in research and development  , the ability to redesign management and organisational systems, and the relative ease of reallocating and retraining   of workers, allowed US firms to benefit from ICT investment and to achieve significant gains in productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.41,0)">Developments in the euro area in the last few years suggest that the decline in labour productivity growth may have come to a halt, although at a very low level, and the longer-term effects of the current downturn still have to be assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.14,0)">Specific policies aimed at increasing employment, particularly in the unskilled segment of the labour market, have certainly contributed to the slowdown in labour productivity growth, especially in services, which are usually more labour-intensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.19,0)">However, the developments in labour supply are only part of the story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.38,0)">To a large extent, the slowdown in labour productivity growth can be attributed to a marked slowdown in total factor productivity   growth, which is generally taken as a measure of technological progress and improvements in the organisation and overall efficiency of production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.74,0)">These developments described for the euro area have also been seen in Spain, where productivity has been very low over recent years around 0.4% on average over the period 1999-2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">This appears to be related to an increase in employment over the last few years and a production structure more oriented towards labour-intensive sectors, in particular construction and services activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">I am aware that improving productivity in Spain is fully acknowledged as a medium-term challenge by the Spanish authorities, as stated in the country’s National Reform Programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">To sum up, the prompt and effective implementation of structural reforms – covering the labour and product markets – is essential in order to raise factor productivity and potential output, to create new jobs, to achieve lower prices and higher real incomes, and to increase the resilience and flexibility of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In this context, let me stress that the Lisbon strategy and the peer surveillance of its implementation at the national level have certainly been successful in raising awareness among Member States that structural reforms are decisive, and the institutional environment has indeed significantly improved over the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.47,0)">However, the reform process is far from being complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.02,0)">The intensity of reform has been uneven across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Countries should be encouraged to continue with the reform process irrespective of the phase of the business cycle, and progress towards the Lisbon targets should be the object of constant monitoring and assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">I should like to discuss some of the key priorities for reform in three main areas, namely getting more people into work; supporting an innovative environment; and increasing competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Getting more people into work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Despite the impressive achievements in job creation, the still relatively high unemployment rates in the euro area, as well as low participation rates in some countries, clearly suggest that there is a need to stimulate not only labour supply but also labour demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.43,0)">As regards labour demand, it is necessary to reduce labour market rigidities, because they restrict wage differentiation and flexibility and thus tend to discourage the hiring of younger and older workers in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.8,0)">Progress towards greater contractual flexibility has remained slow in several euro area countries and employment protection legislation, in particular for permanent contracts, remains fairly rigid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.65,0)">Moreover, in those European countries and regions where competitiveness has declined and/or the unemployment rate remains high, it is important that wage increases do not fully exhaust productivity gains, in order that incentives remain for firms to create additional jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">As regards labour supply, further reforms in income tax and benefit systems would help to increase incentives to work, in particular for those with weaker ties to the labour market, such as women and older workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Supporting an innovative environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The reforms that I have mentioned need to be complemented by measures supporting innovation through higher investment in R&D and policies geared towards improving human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">A more entrepreneur-friendly economic environment is also needed, to ensure that new and dynamic firms emerge which can reap the benefits of pursuing creative and innovative ventures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">We know that R&D, as well as human capital, makes valuable contributions to productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.89,0)">In 2006, R&D investment relative to GDP was only 1.9% in the euro area, compared with 2.7% in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Cooperation between universities, public sector research institutes and industry must also intensify in order to raise the efficiency of public R&D spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.24,0)">Unfortunately, in several euro area countries investment in human capital is still too low for a “knowledge-intensive” economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.41,0)">This is a matter of concern since the employability and flexibility of the labour force requires human capital to be continuously adjusted to labour market needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">This investment should start “early”, by enhancing the quality and efficiency of our schools and universities, and should be continued through lifelong training and learning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Increasing competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Establishing efficient and well-functioning product and services markets can boost productivity trends by enhancing the incentive to invest and innovate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The long-run dividends offered by competition-enhancing policies cannot be overstated, since “little else other than productivity growth matters in the long run”, as Nobel Prize winner Robert Solow once put it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Moreover, such policies will support employment creation, reduce inflation persistence and keep upward price pressures contained, thereby improving the adjustment capacity of countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">It is undeniable that, over the past two decades, significant progress has already been made under the Single Market Programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This has already yielded major benefits for European economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">However, the extension and deepening of the Single Market still remains a high priority in order to achieve further financial market integration, effective competition in the energy market and the full implementation of the Services Directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">III Competitiveness and unit labour cost developments in euro area countries Having discussed the outlook for inflation and growth – as well as highlighted what are in my view the priority areas in which decisive progress on structural reforms is most urgently needed – I would now like to move on to another key challenge for the euro area countries: improving competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.06,0)">In this respect, let me elaborate further on developments in unit labour costs,   which I briefly mentioned a few minutes ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">A number of euro area countries have witnessed relatively strong increases in unit labour costs since the beginning of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">In particular, in cumulative terms, over the nine-year period from 1999 to 2007, a group of countries witnessed increases in unit labour costs of between 25% and 35%, well above the average euro area cumulative increase of around 14%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In Spain, unit labour costs grew in total by around 26% over this period, compared with less than 2% in the case of Germany and around 4% in the case of Austria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.85,0)">Differing developments in unit labour costs across the euro area countries from 1999 to 2007 appear to be largely the result of differences in the growth rates of compensation per employee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.15,0)">However, in a few countries, including Spain, the cumulated productivity growth rate over the nine-year period of reference appears to have been outstandingly low, also contributing to above average increases in unit labour costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.78,0)">Persistent differences in labour cost developments have important implications for the price and cost competitiveness of individual countries and, therefore, an impact on a country’s current account balance through the export channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.8,0)">Most of the euro area countries that experienced a sizeable loss in price and cost competitiveness over the period 1999-2007 appear to have also seen a worsening in their current account positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.55,0)">In particular, in Spain, the current account reached a deficit of 10% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.79,0)">Three main factors can explain relatively strong cumulated labour cost or price increases in individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, there are factors that can be linked to the real convergence and economic integration process of a country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.56,0)">In practical terms, however, it is extremely difficult to disentangle the portion of the price and labour cost differentials that may reflect an adjustment to a new equilibrium level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.08,0)">Second, a lack of flexibility in product and labour markets can create, in the case of adverse shocks, persistent relative price and cost increases in the countries affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.21,0)">The close link between the persistence of wages and inflation may be related to institutional features, such as the presence of some form of automatic price indexation of wages which continues to exist in some countries, including Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.06,0)">And third, an economy can suffer a long period of strong demand pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.79,0)">These pressures may initially be related to either country-specific demand shocks or an excessive reaction to common shocks, which are then exacerbated by overly optimistic expectations on the part of consumers or firms regarding future income prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.97,0)">This situation may be further intensified by an insufficiently tight fiscal stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.45,0)">Such a situation is likely to lead to an inflationary process and cumulated losses in competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.82,0)">Moreover, the impact may be seen not only on goods and services prices but also on asset price inflation, notably in housing markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.55,0)">What then should be done on the policy side?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Let me clarify that country-specific price and labour cost dynamics that result from relatively inefficient institutional arrangements or domestic policies need to be addressed by national policy-makers; as already stressed, structural reforms are key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">With respect to labour market policies, governments and social partners must share responsibility for ensuring that sufficient attention is paid to competitiveness and employment in wage determination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.84,0)">In particular, schemes in which nominal wages are indexed to consumer prices should be abolished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.52,0)">Such schemes involve the risk of upward shocks in inflation leading to a wage-price spiral, which would be detrimental to employment and competitiveness in the countries concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Furthermore, national authorities can make a substantial contribution to more modest labour cost developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In particular, the public sector should be a role model in terms of wage-setting and should not contribute to strong overall labour cost growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.16,0)">Some countries have already started to witness a correction or unwinding of the imbalances accumulated over the last few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.63,0)">In this context, the sooner corrective measures are taken by the national authorities, the lower the risks will be of that country experiencing a protracted period of low growth and losses in employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, having covered a number of areas which are at the heart of monetary policy-making in the euro area, let me conclude by summarising some important points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Specifically, I would like to list a number of points which should be kept in mind if we want to preserve and consolidate the remarkable success of the euro and to reinforce the strength and resilience of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">First, in the current uncertain environment it is crucial that the public’s trust in the soundness of fiscal policies is preserved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Therefore, I welcome that the European Council reconfirmed that budget policies must continue to be in line with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This means that the rules of the Pact should be applied fully, while also reflecting the current exceptional circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Concretely, fiscal policies need to ensure the longer-term sustainability of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For some countries, this implies that there is no leeway for fiscal loosening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">By contrast, countries with budgetary room for manoeuvre can let automatic stabilisers operate freely and fully, thus contributing to smoothing the business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">A second building block on which I touched, and through which we will consolidate our success, is structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">As I have said today, the firm implementation of the Lisbon strategy, as refocused and reinforced by the EU Council, is essential in order to augment our growth potential, consolidate sustainable prosperity and job creation, and strengthen the resilience of our economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">This agenda calls for courageous structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In the current crisis, economic flexibility, including flexibility in prices and wages, is even more important than in more normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.18,0)">Third, as I have explained, it is essential to regularly monitor developments in unit labour costs across the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In particular in those countries, such as Spain, where there has been a substantial and long-lasting cumulation of above average increases in labour costs, and therefore losses in competitiveness, it is essential that all social partners understand the importance, in the context of Monetary Union, of moderating cost and price increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This is crucial in terms of both labour costs and firms’ mark-ups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">All social partners must understand their shared responsibility in delivering price stability and supporting job creation and a sustainable output growth pattern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.78,0)">Fourth, we are presently experiencing a period of intense turbulences which correspond to a very significant market correction at a global level, which is extremely demanding for all Institutions whether public or private, for all market participants and for all authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">The ECB and the Eurosystem together with the other Central Banks have taken a number of decisions as regards the refinancing of commercial banks that were appropriate in view of the exceptional circumstances we had to cope with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Amongst the most recent of these orientations, was the decision to engage in unlimited provision of liquidity for all our refinancing duration, from one week to six months and at a fixed interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Also very significant was the decision to enlarge our collateral framework to facilitate the provision of liquidity to commercial banks in a period of intense stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">I am impressed by the fact that all observers and all our partners have praised our capacity to react rapidly and efficiently to the present exceptional challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.01,0)">At the same time, everybody has recognised that the rapidity of our reaction in the domain of commercial banks’ refinancing did not hamper our credibility in delivering price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We made clear since the first days of the turbulence in the beginning of August 2007 that we were making a very clear separation between the monetary policy stance- aiming at delivering price stability over the medium term- and the implementation of that monetary policy stance, taking into account the “policy level” of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">And fifth, it is precisely because we judged – fully in line with our separation principle – that the alleviation of risks to price stability and the regaining control of inflation expectations were significant and convincing that we decreased rates in October.</span><span style="background-color:
