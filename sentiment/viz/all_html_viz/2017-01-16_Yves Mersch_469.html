    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> Digital Base Money: an assessment from the ECB’s perspective Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Farewell ceremony for Pentti Hakkarainen, Deputy Governor of Suomen Pankki – Finlands Bank,Helsinki, 16 January 2017 We are living in digital times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The internet and portable online devices have radically transformed the way we use and exchange information, and the way we exchange money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Money has been digitalised in many ways and we can now, for instance, transfer bank deposits electronically and pay with e-money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Today I will focus on one type of digital money – Central Bank Digital Currency, or Digital Base Money  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.69,0)">This is money that is characterised by two features:   like banknotes in circulation, DBM is a claim on the central bank;   in contrast to banknotes, it is digital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Of course, DBM already exists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.75,0)">Commercial banks and some other types of institution hold digital claims on central banks in the form of deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">But there has been more recent discussion about whether central banks should provide DBM to a wider range of counterparties, allowing non-banks, including households, to hold accounts at the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The People’s Bank of China, the Bank of England and Sveriges Riksbank have published on this topic or have indicated that they are conducting some work on it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I see two main reasons why this discussion on DBM has been started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">First, electronic payments have become increasingly popular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">There are already a number of electronic payment methods provided by the financial industry, such as credit, debit and pre-paid cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.18,0)">But these methods are based on commercial bank money and people may prefer to hold claims on the central bank to avoid the risk that the commercial bank defaults.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">From this perspective, an increasing demand for DBM could emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Second, some technological developments may now render the introduction of DBM much easier and potentially less expensive than ten years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This includes Distributed Ledger Technology, or DLT, a variant of which is used for Bitcoin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">These are good reasons to start a discussion on DBM and for research to understand better the options available for DBM and their implications for central banks in fulfilling their mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.99,0)">In some European countries, for instance in Sweden and Denmark, electronic payments have started crowding out the use of cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">This may give the discussion an additional drive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the euro area, however, we do not see a trend away from cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">By contrast, in recent years the growth in demand for banknotes in the euro area has by far exceeded that of economic output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.39,0)">For the ECB, the discussion is therefore mainly an analytical one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The ECB would in particular have to understand the impact – positive or negative – of DBM on our primary objective of price stability before considering introducing it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Moreover, any value judgement on DBM needs to be assessed against a number of high-level principles, namely   technological safety,   efficiency,   technological neutrality, and   freedom of choice for users of means of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Today, I would like to outline some of the various options for designing, issuing and managing DBM, and discuss some of their potential consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This will not be an exhaustive list, but it can give first insights into the complexity of the issue at hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Account-based versus value-based Digital Base Money Let me start with a primarily legal dimension, which is the distinction between account-based and value-based DBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.23,0)">Current DBM in the form of commercial bank deposits at the central bank is account based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.99,0)">A transfer of DBM from one bank to another reaches finality when the funds are debited from the account of the payer and credited to the account of the payee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The central bank is directly involved, as it registers the transfer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">Cash is different: it is value based and accounts are not involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.28,0)">A transfer of cash is final when the payer hands the cash over to the payee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.39,0)">The central bank does not register transfers of cash, only the initial issuance and the final return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">DBM held by non-banks could either be account-based – in this case, the central bank would open an account for every interested non-bank – or it would be value-based like cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In this case, interested non-banks would need to be equipped with electronic wallets for holding and using DBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A transfer of DBM would require that the funds be debited from the payer’s electronic wallet and credited to the payee’s device without the involvement of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.7,0)">Whether DBM is account based or value based might matter for several reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.55,0)">Let me mention two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">First, value-based and account-based DBM may require very different types of technology with specific safety features and costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">DLT may be fit for both, but in different ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Second, anonymity towards the central bank can be achieved only with value-based DBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.37,0)">These factors may influence the demand for DBM by non-banks and whether DBM would be used more to substitute cash or bank deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Options for providing DBM With that distinction in mind, let me now turn to the way DBM could be provided to non-banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">A straightforward approach would be to allow non-banks to convert commercial bank deposits into DBM at a rate of 1 to As cash can always be paid into a bank account, this would of course also allow non-banks to convert cash into DBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">It may be argued that with such an approach bank runs could unfold more easily and faster.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.39,0)">Non-banks could react to bad news about a certain bank by quickly switching their deposits into default-free DBM – there would be no need to keep the cash under the mattress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This would counteract important regulatory efforts to reduce excess volatility in the movement of funds between types of investment Yet it is already easy to switch deposits from a bank hit by bad news to another commercial bank that is perceived as safe, so I don’t see an additional risk of bank runs in the event of an idiosyncratic banking event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.34,0)">The situation would be different in a systemic banking crisis, though.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.21,0)">If depositors perceived the entire commercial banking sector as fragile, a sector-wide run might be made more likely and severe by DBM, negatively impacting the efficiency of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Depending on how attractive DBM is for non-banks, a more gradual substitution of commercial bank deposits by DBM is of course possible too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.53,0)">This could have different effects on commercial banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.04,0)">For example, commercial banks with excess central bank reserves could reduce their excess reserves when they experience a DBM-induced deposit outflow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This could increase their profitability in the current situation, as deposits bear a higher interest rate than excess reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.19,0)">But banks without excess central bank reserves might need to replace deposits by central bank credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.32,0)">They would need to provide more collateral to the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">And the interest rate to be paid on central bank credit may, at least in normal times, be higher than the average rate on customer deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.09,0)">The profitability of these banks might suffer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.44,0)">A consequence could be higher interest rates on bank loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.38,0)">These effects may require an adjustment of central bank policy rates and could make monetary policy more difficult until a new steady state is reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">More restrictive approaches to providing DBM may also be considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For example, the central bank could provide DBM to non-banks exclusively in the context of asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.17,0)">That would mean that, to obtain DBM, non-banks would need to sell certain assets to the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">They would not be able to convert commercial bank deposits or cash into DBM directly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">With this more restrictive approach, the central bank would keep the amount of DBM under its full control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It would decide how much assets it would buy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.46,0)">Bank runs or gradual outflows of deposits from commercial banks would not be induced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.23,0)">However, this approach would create some difficult policy decisions for central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.39,0)">Which assets should be purchased, how much and at which prices?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.46,0)">If the demand for DBM was high relative to the amount of DBM the central bank would like to provide, two different prices for eligible assets could emerge: a market price in trades between two market participants; and a price below the market price when the same assets are sold to the central bank against DBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">As a consequence, DBM would be worth more than cash and commercial bank deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">DBM would truly be a currency on its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.01,0)">The central bank would be the issuer of two different currencies, an outcome that does not seem to be in line with fundamental ECB principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">If the central bank wanted to avoid such a situation, it would either need to increase the amount of DBM it provides or make DBM less attractive, for example by lowering the remuneration of DBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.76,0)">I will come to this later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Given these challenges, the more straightforward approach which would allow non-banks to convert bank deposits directly into DBM at a rate of 1 to 1 may therefore appear more attractive, provided that non-banks mainly substitute cash rather than bank deposits with DBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.77,0)">As long as DBM mainly replaces cash, negative side effects of DBM might be unlikely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">In this context, consideration could be given to making DBM as cash-like as possible, at least initially, until more experience is gained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Remuneration of DBM This brings us to the next important question: how should the central bank remunerate DBM held by non-banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">For the euro area, one option could be to remunerate DBM at the same rate as excess central bank reserves held by commercial banks, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.32,0)">at the rate on the deposit facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This would mean applying a policy rate directly to funds held by non-banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">This could potentially strengthen the transmission of monetary policy rate decisions to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.83,0)">The deposit facility rate is currently -0.4%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.21,0)">At this interest rate, demand for DBM may be low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.69,0)">But in normal times, when it is positive, remunerating DBM at the deposit facility rate may be risky.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.3,0)">It could make it too attractive to convert commercial bank deposits into DBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.06,0)">As I argued a few minutes ago, this could have negative side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">An alternative option would then be to remunerate DBM at a rate of 0%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.65,0)">This is the rate at which cash   is de facto “remunerated”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">With a rate of 0%, non-banks are unlikely to convert commercial bank deposits or cash into DBM if their motive is only to obtain a better remuneration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.82,0)">Even in times of negative central bank rates, retail bank customers rarely receive a negative remuneration on commercial bank deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Even so, a 0% interest rate on DBM held by non-banks is not without policy risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.22,0)">If banks have large amounts of excess central bank reserves remunerated at a negative rate, they could try to find ways of replacing their excess reserves by DBM, such as by setting up a non-bank subsidiary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.45,0)">This may counteract monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">If the central bank considered this risk important, it could combine the two approaches I have mentioned so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It could remunerate DBM held by non-banks at a rate of 0%, if the deposit facility rate is positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.56,0)">And if it is negative, we could remunerate at the deposit facility rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.37,0)">This may, however, entail strong movements out of DBM when the deposit facility rate turns negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.95,0)">Moreover, there is a risk that a negative remuneration of claims of non-banks on the central bank would substantially undermine the confidence in the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Technology for DBM Finally, let me mention the technological dimension of DBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">I said that one reason why the discussion on DBM for non-banks has started is that we now have technologies that could make it easier to issue DBM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This includes, in particular, Distributed Ledger Technology  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">DLT carries great potential, but is it already advanced enough to be applied by central banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Reputation is crucial for central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.58,0)">We cannot afford mistakes in the technologies we employ.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Before the central bank can start providing DBM to non-banks, we need to be sure not only that DBM is unlikely to have negative economic side-effects, but also that the relevant systems are operationally efficient and safe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.78,0)">But we should not be dogmatic, either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">If a more efficient, but absolutely safe, technology for central banking operations can be found, introducing it could reduce costs for both the central bank and users, and therefore for society as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">There are many ways to design DBM for non-banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The different options have potential impacts – both positive and negative – that need to be studied and considered carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Only when the best way of designing DBM has been identified, can a decision be made as to whether DBM of non-banks should be introduced at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.39,0)">The most important question for the ECB is whether introducing a DBM would affect our ability to honour our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.96,0)">The impact may be negative if non-banks replace commercial bank deposits with DBM to a significant extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">More generally, any materialisation of DBM would have to be assessed against four principles:   technological safety,   efficiency,   technological neutrality, and   freedom of choice for users of means of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As there has been some speculation about a possible intention of central banks to abolish cash, please let me stress one aspect relating to the principle of freedom of choice: if DBM for non-banks were introduced, it would exist alongside cash for the foreseeable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It would merely be an additional option for non-banks to hold funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In particular, those who are sceptical about digital devices would naturally continue to use cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">Even where efficiency gains are possible when people substitute some of the cash for DBM, this would still require that the technology used for DBM be operationally reliable and secure against attacks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Technological feasibility and cost considerations alone will not change our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Thank you!</span>
