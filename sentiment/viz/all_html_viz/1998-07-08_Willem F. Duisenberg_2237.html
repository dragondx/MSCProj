    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)"> ECB Press conference: Introductory statement Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank Ladies and gentlemen, the Vice-President and I are here today to report on the outcome of the second meeting of the Governing Council of the European Central Bank held yesterday.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The Governing Council first assessed current economic developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The general picture is one of continued economic expansion combined with broadly low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.29,0)">Several forecasts made during spring 1998 have even suggested slightly lower rates of inflation for 1998-99 compared with expectations in autumn 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">As far as price developments are concerned, inflation as measured by the harmonised consumer price index   is estimated to have risen slightly in April, to 1.4%, but has not increased further in May.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Output growth has remained strong in recent quarters, with annual growth rates close to or even exceeding 3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Economic growth has been driven increasingly by domestic demand rather than net exports, as might be expected at this stage of the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Private consumption and stockbuilding have been the main factors underlying domestic demand to date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The favourable conjunctural situation has started to feed through into the labour market, although improvements here have in some countries been too slow to appear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">It is evident, however, that economic growth alone will not reduce the urgency to proceed with structural adjustments in order to tackle unacceptably high rates of unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">As regards monetary and financial developments in the euro area, the annual growth rate of the broad money supply   accelerated in April to around 6% from 5.5% in March.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The growth rate of M1, the narrow money supply, also picked up, to around 10%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We shall monitor these developments very carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">In principle, the economic performance I have just described provides a favourable environment for continued fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">It is with some concern that we observe that in a number of member countries the prospects for this to actually develop seem to be, to put it mildly, rather subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In this respect, I should like to underline three aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.7,0)">First, any "growth dividend" resulting from the current cyclical upturn should be used to bring deficit and debt levels down, rather than relaxing control over expenditure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Second, most Member States need to go a step further, and indeed improve structural balances as they are not yet in compliance with the obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.08,0)">This implies that the benchmark for fiscal policy must now be a budget close to balance or in surplus - in surplus especially in countries with high ratios of debt to GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Third, further structural adjustments in fiscal policy would also help to improve the policy mix in some countries and in the euro area as a whole from the start of Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.33,0)">I would not at the present time want to try to convey too strong an impression of the implications of these various economic developments for the appropriate stance of monetary policies in euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Although the responsibility for these policies remains with national central banks until the end of this year, the Governing Council had an extensive and thorough discussion on a euro area perspective of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We will continue to study this issue closely before we enter the regime of a single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">For the time being, it is encouraging to see the credibility of monetary policy being reflected in the exchange rates of euro countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.49,0)">There is currently no sign of exchange rate tensions among euro area currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Forward exchange rates are expected to be virtually identical to central rates, suggesting that the pre-announced rates are considered credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">I consider this a remarkable achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Following its review of economic developments, the Governing Council settled a number of organisational issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It adopted the Rules of Procedure of the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">These will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities;   It approved, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, the establishment of eleven ESCB committees to assist in the work of the European System of Central Banks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The committees are as follows  : Accounting and Monetary Income Committee, Banking Supervision Committee, Banknote Committee, External Communications Committee, Information Technology Committee, Internal Auditors Committee, Legal Committee, Market Operations Committee, Monetary Policy Committee, Payment and Settlement Systems Committee, and Statistics Committee;   It formally adopted a budget for the European Central Bank for the second half of 1998 and agreed on the establishment of a Budget Committee to assist the Governing Council in ECB budget-related matters;   It laid down specific rules applicable to staff transferring from the European Monetary Institute to the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.78,0)">ECB Decisions relating to the Conditions of Employment will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The Governing Council also took a number of decisions relating to various aspects of its preparatory work for Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Monetary policy issues The Governing Council decided on the introduction of a minimum reserve system by the ESCB at the start of Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Among the three main functions that a minimum reserve system could usefully perform, the Governing Council attaches particularly high importance to its contributions to the stabilisation of money market interest rates and to the enlargement of the demand for central bank money by creating or enlarging a structural liquidity shortage in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">In the light of the potential burden which a minimum reserve system could impose on the private sector and the effects it might have on the financial activity of credit institutions in the euro area, the Governing Council has decided on features which fulfil the two money market management purposes outlined above, while at the same time allowing an adequate remuneration of minimum reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">A number of details of the minimum reserve system that will be applied were already specified in previous documents published by the European Monetary Institute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Additional features agreed upon yesterday include the liability base, the lump-sum allowance and the rate of remuneration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">With regard to the latter, the ECB will remunerate minimum reserve holdings at a level corresponding to the rate of its main refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The Governing Council intends to decide on the exact specification of the minimum reserve system in November 1998 at the latest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This decision, in particular as regards the reserve ratio  , will be based on the early data from the new system for money and banking statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this morning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is intended that the precise features of the minimum reserve system will be published in the form of an EU Council Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">For this purpose, the Governing Council adopted an ECB Recommendation for an EU Council Regulation on the application of minimum reserves by the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In accordance with the provisions of the Statute of the ESCB, the EU Council, acting by a qualified majority and after consulting the European Parliament and the Commission, is expected to adopt this Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The Governing Council also adopted ECB Recommendations for EU Council Regulations concerning the collection of statistical information by the ECB and concerning the powers of the ECB to impose sanctions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">All three ECB Recommendations will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities for general notice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Foreign exchange issues The Governing Council decided on the size and form of the initial transfer of foreign reserve assets to the European Central Bank from the national central banks participating in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This transfer is to take place on the first day of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It has been decided that the initial transfer will be to the maximum allowed amount of EUR 50 billion, adjusted downwards by deducting the shares in the ECB's capital subscription key of the EU central banks which will not participate in the euro area at the outset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The transfer will thus be equal to 78.9153% of EUR 50 billion, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">approximately EUR 39.46 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The Governing Council furthermore agreed that this initial transfer should be in gold in an amount equivalent to 15% of the sum I have just mentioned, with the remaining 85% being transferred in foreign currency assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I should stress that the decision on the percentage of gold to be transferred to the ECB will have no implications for the consolidated gold holdings of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The precise modalities of the initial transfer will be finalised before the end of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Before the end of the current year the Governing Council will also have to adopt an ECB Guideline pursuant to Article 31.3 of the Statute of the ESCB, which will subject all operations in foreign reserve assets remaining with the national central banks - including gold - to approval by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">In connection with the setting-up of common market standards, the Governing Council also reached agreement on a number of issues related to the quotation and publication of reference exchange rates for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Specifically, it was agreed to recommend to market participants the "certain" method for quoting the exchange rates for the euro   and to have daily reference exchange rates for the euro computed and published by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this morning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Payment systems issues The Governing Council decided on the conditions for the participation of the non-euro area EU central banks and credit institutions in the TARGET   system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In TARGET the ESCB will provide central bank liquidity in the course of the day   to the extent necessary to avoid delays in the execution of payment orders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.53,0)">If intraday liquidity is not reimbursed at the end of the day it becomes overnight credit granted by the ESCB, which, for evident monetary policy reasons, cannot be offered to institutions outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Nonetheless, non-euro area EU central banks and institutions in those countries will be connected to TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.24,0)">The Governing Council considered that giving such institutions outside the euro area unlimited access to intraday credit would have created risks for the conduct of monetary policy that it was not ready to take.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">A facility will therefore be put in place to enable the non-euro area EU central banks to provide collateralised intraday credit in euro to their credit institutions, subject to a ceiling both at the level of the non-euro area EU central banks and at that of non-euro area credit institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.7,0)">There will also be a liquidity deadline, set at 5 p.m. , for non-euro area credit institutions so that they do not incur an overnight overdraft in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this morning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The Governing Council also agreed that a report on recent developments in the field of electronic money - and their monetary policy implications - would be published in September 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Legal protection of euro banknotes Finally, the Governing Council agreed on a number of legal instruments aimed at enhancing the protection of euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">In particular, an ECB Decision on the denominations, specifications, reproduction, exchange and withdrawal of banknotes has been adopted, as well as an ECB Recommendation regarding the adoption of certain measures to enhance the legal protection of euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Both documents will be published for general information in the Official Journal of the European Communities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Further details are provided in the separate press release that is being issued to you this morning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">We are at your disposal for further questions.</span>
