    <h3> Speaker: Vítor Constâncio </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)"> A European solution for crisis management and bank resolution Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB,at Riksbank and ECB Conference on Bank Resolution,Stockholm, 14 November 2011 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, It is an honour for me to speak at today’s conference, which has provided a stimulating debate on the challenging topic of bank recovery and resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The complexity of developing an effective framework for crisis management and resolution arises from the objective of achieving stability in increasingly integrated financial systems, where the authorities responsible for safeguarding their respective stability are still responsible towards their respective taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This element of complexity has been taken into account in a number of policy initiatives and suggestions worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Especially in the EU context, I wish to acknowledge the pivotal role played by Lars Nyberg in this domain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">His long-time devotion to the design and implementation of EU crisis management arrangements, coupled with his qualities as a central banker, have made Lars a key policy-maker for crisis management in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">I would also like to thank Lars for his long-standing and fruitful collaboration with the ECB in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Principally in the context of the work carried out by the Banking Supervision Committee, but also as Chairman of the EFC High-Level Working Group on Crisis Management, Lars has very often acted as a catalyst for coordination and cooperation among national authorities and EU institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">In my speech today, I would like to focus on the ongoing reforms aimed at enhancing the mechanisms with which authorities can handle problems in banks and reduce the potential impact of failures, should they occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.26,0)">First, I will briefly recall the main shortcomings of the current resolution regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Second, I will consider the international, European and national initiatives to cope with the challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Finally, I would like to say a few words about the future path towards an optimal arrangement for cross-border resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.81,0)">The Main Shortcomings of the current frameworks During the current crisis we have seen several government-funded bailouts and one case where, in place of a bailout, a disorderly collapse occurred with widespread effects around the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.12,0)">There are multiple reasons why no better alternative between these two extreme solutions was available in these cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.93,0)">First, letting financial institutions fail was often not a feasible alternative from a legal perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.05,0)">In a majority of countries, only normal corporate insolvency proceedings were – and in many countries, still are – available to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.59,0)">However, limiting credit and liquidity losses in the case of failure may not be effectively ensured by using these mechanisms, because they were not designed to take into account the special nature of credit institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Second, even if a well-designed special bank resolution or insolvency regime is in place in a particular country, this does not guarantee that cross-border banks can also be dealt with effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.0,0)">A cross-border crisis situation involves several national authorities, of course, each having different mandates regarding when and how they can intervene.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Even more importantly, these authorities may have different objectives to pursue, but are in all cases accountable to national taxpayers and depositors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.55,0)">Third, and closely linked to the previous two points, the lack of private financing arrangements also poses a significant barrier to effective resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Even the best resolution framework needs some funds to finance the measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">However, as long as strong inter-linkages exist between supervisory and crisis management policies on the one hand and fiscal policies on the other, cooperation will be hard to ensure among national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">As an alternative, there are many possible forms of private financing: one could use the funds of the deposit guarantee scheme, set up an ex ante resolution fund, or ensure that the creditors contribute to recapitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.17,0)">The bottom line is that the lack of such a means ultimately undermines the effective implementation of resolution measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Initiatives at the Global level Work at the international level to address these issues is ongoing and there are some promising developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The Financial Stability Board’s   new standard, “Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes”, adopted by the G20, is a point of reference for the reform of our national resolution regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">These key attributes aim to enable authorities to resolve failing financial firms in an orderly manner and without exposing the taxpayer to the risk of loss.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This initiative addresses all the three shortcomings that I have just mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The FSB standard contains a comprehensive list of tools and powers which every national resolution authority should have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">This means that they aim to improve the national regimes, while at the same time providing for convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The FSB key attributes also strengthen, in my view, the group resolution concept, by envisaging that recovery and resolution plans also have a global perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Making the national supervisors and resolution authorities plan together how the problems of their groups could be handled would already be a big step forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In that context, the authorities will also be asked to take into consideration the effects of cross-border contagion in crisis scenarios and simultaneous stress situations in several significant markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">I would also highlight the fact that authorities will also have the right to improve the resolvability of large and complex groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me recall here that Lehman Brothers had a presence in some 50 countries and comprised almost 3000 legal entities before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Simplifying the structure of global systemic groups could well be extremely useful in preparing for future crises, but authorities will clearly need to work very closely with one another to implement such modifications with great care.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Should the group get into difficulties, the Crisis Management Groups could indeed be helpful in promoting cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">With such a forum in place, there would at least be a chance of authorities reaching a consensus on how to resolve a cross-border bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Already today we are quite advanced in this regard, as there are 14 Crisis Management Groups for which EU authorities act as coordinators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These groups are truly global, involving authorities of numerous countries, ranging from Japan to Mexico.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The issue of private financing is also addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The FSB standard states that jurisdictions should have in place privately financed deposit insurance or resolution funds, or a funding mechanism for ex post recovery from the industry of the costs of providing temporary financing to facilitate the resolution of a firm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Bail-in, a form of creditor-financed recapitalisation, is also an important element of the FSB standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">I consider bail-in as an apparently promising resolution tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">However, in many cases, in order to ensure the robust viability of the distressed bank after such a measure and to limit moral hazard, a bail-in mechanism will need to accompanied by a set of other restructuring   or resolution measures   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">For cross-border institutions, international cooperation to elaborate resolution plans and implement them, it would help if other measures would be adopted like enforceable netting agreements, segregation of clients positions and, specially, the move of OTC derivatives to central counterparties   and to organised markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The new bank resolution regime in the EU Let me now turn more specifically to the EU, where a legislative proposal for a directive – in line with the FSB standard – will shortly be published by the Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Judging by the papers and communications previously made public, the new framework has the overall objective of dealing with failing institutions in a way that safeguards the stability of the EU financial system as a whole and minimises public costs and economic disruption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">A number of innovative elements can be identified in this emerging framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">First, it covers not only resolution, but rather all phases of a bank crisis, including preventive measures and early intervention powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.33,0)">Accordingly, if problems were to arise in a bank, so that it became likely that it would breach the prudential requirements, a harmonised set of early intervention measures could be applied by supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This area is highly important, since I strongly believe that a timely step by a supervisor to prevent things from getting worse is worth more than the best resolution efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The early intervention measures envisaged, such as prohibiting the payment of dividends, imposing additional reporting requirements, and requiring the replacement of managers or directors or the cessation of certain risky activities, are already in the toolkit of some Member States, but the new framework would mean that each tool would be available in each Member State, and it would be applied in a harmonised manner, based on common triggers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Second, a forward-looking element of the new framework is the concept of intra-group financial support, which could reduce the current legal uncertainty that surrounds asset transferability within groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.42,0)">In today’s regulatory environment, group liquidity management may in some cases be suboptimal, making the survival of a group more difficult as a result of – for instance – supervisory ring-fencing measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">At the same time, some of these restrictions are in fact justified, since they serve to protect domestic creditors and shareholders from unfavourable transfers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This implies that the conditions for intra-group loans, guarantees and transfers of assets for collateral could be set out in group financial support agreements between parent banks and bank subsidiaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.55,0)">However, progress in this area is extremely challenging, since group interest is not a well-defined legal concept, while national laws focus on protecting local creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Here I think the critical issue is whether we manage to include adequate safeguards in the framework to ensure that the financial stability of the transferring country is not exposed to undue risk as a result of the support provided according to the agreement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This means that host countries supervisors have to be involved in any solution implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Third, I also consider the involvement of the European Banking Authority   as a very promising element of the EU plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The EBA could play two equally important roles in the future regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As a standard-setter, the EBA drafts binding technical standards and non-binding guidelines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">This could be key to ensuring true convergence in national approaches as well as transparency vis-à-vis market players regarding the details of the possible measures to be applied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">As a supervisory authority, the EBA is involved in the resolution colleges and, even more importantly, its mediation powers have the capacity to actively foster cooperation and coordination also in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">The new EU bank resolution regime can also draw inspiration from a number of ongoing national initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">These national laws already aim, in large part, to stay close to the Commission’s proposals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The ECB is currently involved in supporting the implementation of new resolution frameworks in Ireland Portugal and Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The practical development of these regimes sheds light on some important areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In particular, a number of critical points have emerged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.69,0)">To mention just a few, the property rights of stakeholders constitute a legally complex issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.2,0)">For instance, obligations to hold a general meeting to decide on an increase in capital could hamper the efficient and swift resolution or restructuring of a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">For any regime, it will be important to properly balance the fundamental rights of shareholders and also creditors with the general interest in the financial system’s stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In this perspective, the example of the US FDIC´s powers should be taken into consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The establishment of temporary credit institutions or bridge banks is emerging as a key resolution tool, but the new resolution frameworks need to address a number of related technical issues, such as the question of who provides the necessary capital and liquidity to the bridge institution, how the bridge bank can use the infrastructure of the failed bank, and how and when it is ultimately dissolved, since bridge banks are temporary entities needing a good exit strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.05,0)">Finally, the design of bank levies, which could usefully be collected into resolution funds, is also a delicate area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Mechanisms are under examination both to recoup the losses of the crisis and to create provisions against future events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">I believe that ex ante funding is a crucial element, since it may reduce moral hazard and improves the authorities’ ability to react to crises earlier, thus strengthening the credibility of such actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Levies are valuable revenue-raising mechanisms with which to finance crisis measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Uncertainty remains as to how they would affect the particular problem of moral hazard in the financial sector, and both the rate and the base of levies need to be determined with care, especially if we want to include the aspect of systemic risk as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">However, maintaining a level playing field and coordination between Member States remains in my view paramount in order to avoid a distortion of fund contributions and resolution tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Challenges ahead – more integration I am confident that the emerging EU regime will appropriately address all these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">As for cooperation among authorities, the new resolution regime will take the form of a coordination framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Accordingly, national authorities will ultimately maintain their discretion in the most important decisions, although they will be strongly encouraged to try to reach joint decisions on the ways to handle bank crises in resolution colleges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">This is a realistic approach, already representing a major step forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">However, I think there may be a need for even more integration in the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.4,0)">As an example, insolvency laws are addressed by neither the FSB standard nor the EU proposal – at least not its first phase of implementation – although they may well be important in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">One also wonders whether there are other areas in which we could make progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">There were, and in fact continue to be, numerous proposals for the optimal European arrangement in the academic and policy sphere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Let me just mention three of them, which I find particularly inspiring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Most of you will be familiar with the influential arguments of Charles Goodhart and Dirk Schoenmaker, who have said that, as a form of coordination among national governments to handle cross-border bank crises, legally binding burden-sharing rules should be drawn up ex ante.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Others, including David G. Mayes, have recommended adopting the prompt corrective action approach of the United States by designing a framework that would be based on stringent rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.03,0)">Under such a framework, it would be clear for both banks and the authorities, that measures of increasing intrusiveness would have follow as the financial situation of a bank worsened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.48,0)">An important element of such a regime that limits moral hazard, regulatory forbearance and creditor losses as well, is that authorities are obliged to take over a failing bank before its capital is fully depleted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Finally, many, including the staff of the IMF, have supported the idea of a European Resolution Authority responsible for crisis management and resolution, probably combined with a European Deposit Insurance and Resolution Fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.37,0)">This is certainly the most ambitious plan of all, but was always considered as politically challenging and legally difficult to implement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Advancing towards a truly European solution I believe that all these proposals have important elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In my view, the optimal arrangement for the EU would probably draw on all of these.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">There should be binding rules for the cooperation of Member States, and measures should be activated according to clear and transparent – although not automatic and not solely quantitative-based – triggers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Indeed, the resolution of a cross-border systemically important financial institution would probably be most efficient if the measures were at least strongly coordinated by one lead authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Or, if we go a step further in our thinking, the ultimate long-term vision could be to establish one supranational authority, an FDIC-type entity implementing group resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Clearly, at the international level, this now seems to be out of reach, but one could ask whether at least in the EU such an arrangement might be feasible sometime in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">If ever put in place, an EU-level resolution authority could act as a resolution authority responsible for all the major cross-border banks of the EU, working together with national authorities as its agents, operating on the basis of a single crisis management, resolution and insolvency framework for EU banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the field of prudential regulation, something similar is already happening, since the new Basel rules will partly take the form of an EU regulation, thereby eliminating the room for national differences in transposition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In the future, the Single Rulebook could ultimately be one that also covers the crisis management, resolution and insolvency of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">If we continue to unfold this vision, there would also be a need for robust arrangements to finance the measures of such an authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">An obvious option for that purpose would be an EU-level fund of resolution funds, or a single EU resolution fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">The benefits of such an integrated regime are most easily seen if we imagine how resolution under a loose cooperation framework would work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">A previous mapping exercise by the ECB identified more than 40 banking groups with significant cross-border activities which were headquartered in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Notably, 17 of them had a presence in at least ten Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The resolution of such a bank would involve ten national authorities, ten resolution funds and ten deposit guarantee schemes; needless to say, there would be many challenges involved in ensuring efficient coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The envisaged EU authority would spare us a great deal of these efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And I see no reason why such a vision should be considered unrealistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Events are moving faster now than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.16,0)">Crises make us reconsider things that we would have seen as beyond the feasibility horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">For example, of the challenges that I have mentioned here today, the financing part is probably the biggest obstacle for such a quantum leap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">However, in another dimension and for the euro area we already have the EFSF in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.41,0)">Such a facility would have been simply unthinkable a couple of years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Similarly, I consider the setting-up of a permanent EU or euro area resolution fund to be one imaginable way to proceed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Of course, I am fully aware of the technical, legal and, most importantly, political complexities of such a move.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Nonetheless, Europe could advance step by step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">The euro area may be the most realistic starting point, since a stronger concept of the euro area as a legitimate entity has already been emerging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Likewise, fiscal coordination has been fundamentally strengthened during the crisis, paving the way for a specific economic governance concept for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">For the euro area I will say clearly: we need for cross-border banking institutions a European Resolution Authority, including or combined with a Resolution Fund, as well as a European Supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This requirement is not only a necessity stemming from the high degree of interconnectedness among euro area banks, but constitutes also a major lesson of the present crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.09,0)">Indeed, some of the major imbalances that are besetting the euro area stemmed from uncontrolled behaviour of some banking sectors that eventually contaminated the sovereign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">However, in the longer term, one can only envisage an integral EU resolution framework on a full EU basis, reflecting the highly integrated financial system in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In parallel with the establishment of an EU resolution fund, we could gradually also start preparing to set up an EU-level resolution authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Following a pragmatic approach, we could focus on the recently established Cross-Border Stability Groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Common practical guidelines and blueprints could be prepared for them to foster a more harmonised approach for resolution across jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">With a more forward-looking approach, on the basis of frequent peer reviews, qualitative assessments and stocktaking of best practices, we could gradually explore the possibilities of entering into more binding multilateral agreements within these groups, which in turn would pave the way for an EU-level authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">We should not forget that the supervisory reform process based on the De Larosière proposals is not yet finished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.31,0)">The review of the new EU supervisory authorities is scheduled for 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">While the optimal supervisory structure of the EU is a topic that deserves a separate speech of its own, it may suffice to say that this supervisory review may be a very good occasion to consider the suitability of moving both supervision and resolution together into an even more European set-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Likewise, there are already legislative proposals for a network of national EU deposit guarantee schemes, having the possibility to borrow from each other, if need be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">I consider this as an ambitious plan which rightly mirrors the cross-border nature of our banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In fact, such a mutually supportive structure of deposit insurance is not far removed from an EU-level fund of funds, nor from an EU-level deposit guarantee scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Concluding words Let me conclude by saying that the seeds of an integrated EU resolution framework are already there today, but it is an open question whether the EU will have the audacity, and, in particular, the political will, to move towards that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">I firmly believe that if we wish to preserve the benefits of integrated cross-border banks in Europe and globally we must built an European resolution regime that enhances market discipline by mitigating moral hazard, maintains stability by ensuring continuity of basic services of unwinding institutions, orderly allocates losses and protects taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">To achieve this goal, we will have to make sure that our authorities speak a common language and that the thorny issue of public burden-sharing is replaced by private burden-sharing as far as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Based on these preconditions and building on the practical operation of cross-border stability groups, we should gradually move towards a stronger coordination of cross-border resolution, with the ultimate vision of a single EU resolution authority and an integrated EU resolution regime.</span>
