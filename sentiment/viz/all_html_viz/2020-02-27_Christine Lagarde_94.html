    <h1> Climate change and the financial sector </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the launch of the COP 26 Private Finance Agenda </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Christine Lagarde </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.09,0)"> London, 27 February 2020 Climate change and the financial sector Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the launch of the COP 26 Private Finance Agenda Climate change constitutes a major challenge, causing both threats and opportunities that will significantly affect the economy and the financial sector, depending on which carbon emission scenario eventually unfolds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">That is why central banks need to devote greater attention to understanding the impact of climate change, including its implications for inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">At the ECB, the ongoing review of our monetary policy strategy creates an opportunity to reflect on how to address sustainability considerations within our monetary policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Today, however, I will focus my remarks on climate change-related risks for the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.64,0)">Broadly speaking, the main risks fall into three categories: risks stemming from disregard, from delay and from deficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.25,0)">Risks from disregarding climate change Disregarding the implications of climate change can generate significant risks for the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.11,0)">Total insurance losses for weather-related events reached 0.1% of GDP in 2018, with total economic losses approximately double that amount.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The number of catastrophes caused by natural hazards increased from 249 in 1980 to 820 in 2019, peaking at 848 in 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Adjusting for inflation, overall economic losses increased from around USD 60 billion in 1980, to USD 150 billion in 2019, with a peak of USD 350 billion in 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.87,0)">According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial times is likely to bring about substantial changes in our climate, increasing the likelihood of more extreme weather conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.68,0)">As a result, insurance and economic losses caused by climate-related events are likely to start trending upwards as a share of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Insurance and reinsurance companies need to continue to ensure that risk pricing remains appropriate and that reserves are adequate to cover expected losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.47,0)">Banks also need to consider the risks such events create for their credit exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.79,0)">Losses can arise from both direct damage and from the effects that potentially higher maintenance costs, disruption and lower labour productivity could have on profitability and hence default risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.68,0)">Risks from delaying the response to climate change The second source of risk for the financial sector arises from the pathway taken to a carbon-neutral world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Achieving the transition almost certainly requires intervention by public authorities through regulation and taxation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Early and coordinated action can help deliver a smooth transition for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.11,0)">But if that intervention is delayed, the reduction in emissions may have to be sharper, resulting in a disorderly, disjointed and more disruptive transition for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.12,0)">Certain economic activities may quickly be rendered obsolete, leading to a re-pricing of assets and the risk that some will become stranded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It is vital, then, for financial institutions to understand the risks on their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Greater disclosure by companies on their climate exposure is a prerequisite, bolstering the ability of market participants and financial institutions to carry out appropriate risk assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.41,0)">Disclosures by financial institutions themselves suggest that there is some way to go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.88,0)">Recent analysis of the 12 largest banks and 14 largest insurers in the euro area shows that a majority disclose the impact of their business travel, commuting and other energy usage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.96,0)">Yet most of their exposure to climate-related risk is likely to stem from their financial activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.65,0)">Only 5 out of the 26 partially disclose the impact of their financial assets, and none of them provide full disclosure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The Eurosystem is now reviewing the extent to which climate-related risks are understood and priced by the market and is paying close attention to how credit-rating agencies incorporate such risks into their assessments of creditworthiness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">We will continue to evaluate the implications for our own management of risk, in particular through our collateral framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">ECB Banking Supervision is assessing banks’ approaches to climate risks and developing supervisory expectations on those risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Preparatory work is also under way for a macroprudential stress test to assess climate-related risks, with the first results expected by the end of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The stress test framework aims to assess how climate-related risks propagate through the real economy and the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The stress test will draw on granular information, possibly including geographical location and carbon footprint, and focus on 90 significant institutions across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Importantly, it will also at some stage model how dynamic interactions can amplify the effects, for example if banks react to losses by deleveraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.86,0)">Risks from deficiency in the provision of finance Which leads me to my final category of risk: deficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The financial sector will be pivotal in mobilising the necessary financial resources for the transition and in helping our economies to cope through adaptation and mitigation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">It is vital that it provides finance of sufficient quantity and quality for the task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">High insurance coverage and deep capital markets help mitigate the macroeconomic impact of disasters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.69,0)">This matters at a microeconomic level, too, where a lack of effective access to insurance and finance can lead to a disproportionately greater impact of disasters on poorer households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.14,0)">In the absence of insurance, households will have to rely more on precautionary saving or government transfers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Substantial investment is likely to be required to underpin the energy transition, with some estimates running to hundreds of billions of euro each year in the European Union alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Meeting that challenge requires contributions from both the public and private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">The European Union has been at the forefront of the global push to substantially reduce carbon emissions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In December 2019, the European Commission proposed a European Green Deal, subsequently endorsed by the European Council, that calls for zero net emissions of greenhouse gasses by 2050.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">This goal enjoys broad public  and political support, and the concrete measures required to meet it are now being fleshed out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Another field where the European Union has taken the lead internationally is on the issuance of green bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The European Investment Bank was the first issuer of green bonds in 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">In 2018, 31% of the financing it provided was oriented towards climate mitigation and adaptation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">That has helped foster a growing market for green bonds within Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">European entities account for around half of global issuance of green bonds, and around 42% of the global market is denominated in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Indeed, green bonds are now approaching 10% of total euro-denominated bond issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The European Union also launched a comprehensive action plan in 2018 to promote sustainable finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">That plan is already bearing fruit, including the recent agreement on the taxonomy framework for assessing the sustainability of economic activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The taxonomy represents an important step towards categorising green investments on a sound and consistent basis and will help underpin further market developments in green finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">But a common approach is needed to mobilise global funding for the transition, while at the same time remaining vigilant against attempts to green wash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.44,0)">Unnecessary fragmentation in regulation will impair the sustainable growth of green finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Conclusion The transition to a carbon-neutral economy provides opportunities, not just risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">By shifting the horizon away from the short term and contributing to a more sustainable economic trajectory, the financial sector can become a powerful force acting in our collective best interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The future path for carbon emissions and the climate is uncertain, but it remains within our power to influence it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">As Lyndon B. Johnson said, “yesterday is not ours to recover, but tomorrow is ours to win or lose”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.92,0)">Source: Munich Re NatCatSERVICE.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">To an extent, that increase also reflects a greater concentration of economic activity in regions vulnerable to natural hazards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  , Special report – Global Warming of 1.5°C.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">, Giuzio M. and Mikkonen K.  , “Climate risk-related disclosures of banks and insurers and their market impact”, Financial Stability Review, ECB, November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">, von Dahlen, S. and Saxena, S.  , “Unmitigated disasters?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">New evidence on the macroeconomic cost of natural catastrophes”, BIS Working Papers, No 394, Bank for International Settlements; Noy, I.  , “The macroeconomic consequences of disasters”, Journal of Development Economics, 88 , pp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.65,0)">221-231.   , Little, P., Mogues, T. and Negatu, W.  , “Poverty Traps and Natural Disasters in Ethiopia and Honduras,” World Development, 35 , pp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">835-856; Nazrul Islam, S. and Winkel, J.  , “Climate Change and Social Inequality,” Working Papers, No 152, United Nations, Department of Economics and Social Affairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">According to the European Commission, achieving the Paris Agreement targets requires up to €260 billion of additional investment per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.2,0)">79% of Europeans see climate change as a very serious problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">92% – and more than 8 in 10 people in each Member State – agree that emissions should be reduced to a minimum in order to make the EU climate-neutral by 2050.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.15,0)">Source: Dealogic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Johnson, L.
