    <span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)"> The future of monetary policy frameworks Lecture by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the European Central Bank at the Instituto Superior de Economia e Gestão, Lisbon, 25 May 2017 Ten years after the economic and financial crisis of 2007-09, the recovery in the euro area is resilient and increasingly broad-based even if overall risks remain tilted to the downside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Monetary policy plays a crucial role in supporting that recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Through a combination of interest rate cuts and expansions of the Eurosystem balance sheet, the ECB provided the necessary degree of monetary stimulus to prevent an even deeper cyclical downturn and to avert the risk of outright deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The continuation of such monetary stimulus remains important to ensure a sustainable adjustment of the inflation process towards levels consistent with the ECB price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In advanced economies, many commentators have started discussing whether central banking will eventually return to the pre-crisis status quo, or whether the many innovative tools assembled to respond to the crisis will be a permanent feature or even whether monetary policy regime should undergo a more complete overhaul.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">My intention today is to engage in this discussion which can be divided into two themes: what should central banks’ target, and which tools should they use to reach that objective?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In most advanced economies, central banks operate under a strategy that is consistent with the theoretical flexible inflation targeting approach and that aims to achieve low inflation, or price stability, as a primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.63,0)">After the global financial crisis, this approach has come into criticism, in particular with regards to perceived weaknesses in fighting deep recessions and the extent to which financial stability concerns should be integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">A range of alternatives have been proposed, such as nominal GDP or price level targets, increasing the inflation target or even setting policy by a mechanical formula like a Taylor Rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The main question that emerged after the crisis from a monetary policy framework perspective refers to what degree financial stability considerations should be included in central banks’ competences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The second theme deals with the specific policy instruments used by central banks in order to achieve their objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.74,0)">The pre-crisis consensus in advanced economies was to rely almost exclusively on a short-term interest rate as the monetary policy instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.62,0)">After the economic and financial crisis, central banks have pushed the short-term interest rate to previously unthinkable low levels – including negative in the euro area and other countries, and have created new instruments to complement or substitute its effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Given the experience gained with these new instruments, the questions are whether these should become a permanent feature of the central bank toolkit, or whether they remain non-standard measures reserved for extreme circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Should central banks be even bolder than they have been in devising new tools?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.53,0)">Should monetary policy strategies change?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">According to Svensson  , inflation targeting can be broadly characterised by three elements: 1) an announced numerical inflation target; 2) monetary policy decisions that make the inflation forecast converge to this numerical target, and 3) a high degree of transparency and accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy strategy is consistent with these broad features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The ECB aims to maintain price stability over the medium-term, with an announced objective of annual inflation below, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Substantial effort has been made to explain the strategy and monetary policy decisions, by holding press conferences after the Governing Council’s monetary policy meetings, publishing detailed accounts of these meetings and delivering speeches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Prior to the financial crisis, the performance of inflation targeting was in practice widely considered as a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">To recall that in the 70s and 80s, a period that now seems in the distant past, the key challenge for central banks was very high inflation, not too low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.04,0)">Empirical evidence suggests that countries that adopted inflation targeting, beginning with New Zealand in 1989, have experienced lower average inflation rates than they did before its adoption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.63,0)">For instance, in a prominent study, Carl Walsh identifies ten inflation-targeting OECD countries and reports that the average inflation rate across countries declined from 9.2% prior to the adoption of inflation targeting to 3.2% after the adoption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Importantly, the decline in the level of inflation was accompanied by a decline in the volatility of inflation and an improved anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Flexible inflation targeting implies that the central bank attempts to reach the target gradually in the medium-term and not in the immediate period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.7,0)">Svensson    has shown that this gradualism is equivalent to an objective function that includes both the inflation rate deviation from its target and the output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is close to inflation targeting regimes of central banks with a dual mandate but with primordial importance given to inflation as the variable in relation to which monetary policy is more efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">On the other hand, Bean    has shown that no great differences exist between a flexible inflation targeting framework and one with a nominal GDP target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">These similarities should be taken into consideration when understanding the popularity of the flexible inflation targeting framework since the early 90s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.21,0)">This positive verdict on inflation targeting has been more recently called into question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.71,0)">Typically, opponents of inflation targeting rely on one of the following two arguments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.28,0)">First, some criticise inflation targeting for having failed to prevent the occurrence of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.16,0)">Inflation-targeting central banks, it is argued, focused too narrowly on inflation stabilisation and payed too little attention to financial developments, such as the rapid increase in house prices or the rise in financial institutions’ leverage ratios prior to the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.97,0)">Second, inflation targeting is attacked for its apparent inability to speed up the recovery in economic activity and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Incorporating financial stability considerations into monetary policy decisions Prior to the crisis, there was a common view that central banks should focus on inflation stabilisation and only care about financial developments should these have direct implications for inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Another view was that by ensuring price stability, monetary policy would also cater for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.85,0)">The crisis proved that this was not true as a period of moderate inflation coincided with the build-up of financial imbalances and asset price bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It was hard to argue that conventional monetary policy using interest rates could and should be used to address those imbalances or prick asset price bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.27,0)">Indeed, it is difficult to identify bubbles and virtually impossible to calibrate interest rates to produce the desired effects on asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.72,0)">In many cases, the required increase in interest rates would create unnecessary recessionary episodes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.05,0)">The use of monetary policy to “lean against the wind” may be very costly, as Svensson   has demonstrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.42,0)">In this sense, inflation targeting cannot be blamed for failing to prevent the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Financial stability concerns should be addressed with macroprudential tools, generally of a regulatory nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Some of these instruments should be given to central banks to be used as complement to monetary policy as has been the case in several countries following the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">This principle is reflected in the ECB’s new microprudential and macroprudential competences, including the power to top up national macroprudential measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.5,0)">Let me now turn to the second argument against inflation targeting: its apparent inability to engineer a quicker recovery in economic activity and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">To provide you with some additional figures, it took the euro area almost eight years before real GDP reached the 2008 Q1 level again, which marked the previous peak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.14,0)">Likewise, HICP inflation has been considerably below 2% since the second half of 2013, and only more recently started to move closer to its objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This increase in headline inflation was however mainly driven by rising energy and food prices and not accompanied by the evolution of underlying inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.36,0)">Price and nominal GDP level targeting Against this background, some commentators argue that inflation targets should be replaced with some sort of level target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The two most prominent examples are price level targeting and nominal GDP level targeting, where central bank aim to stabilise the price level and nominal GDP respectively along some target path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Proponents of level targeting strategies argue that they allow for a more powerful management of private sector expectations, leading to better stabilisation outcomes than under inflation targeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.04,0)">In the case of a price level target, if there is downward pressure on the inflation rate so that the price level falls below its target path, then future inflation has to be temporarily higher in order to bring the price level back on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In theory, the private sector would internalise these dynamics and increase its inflation expectations every time there is downward pressure on the price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">In turn, higher expected inflation would mitigate the downward pressure on today’s inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">This expectations channel of monetary policy transmission associated with level targeting strategies is especially compelling in a low interest rate environment where the effective lower bound on nominal interest rates limits the scope for counteracting downward pressure on inflation rates by reducing current policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Indeed, in the United States, some central bankers have publicly called for a temporary adoption of a level target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In spite of these appealing arguments based on monetary theory, level targeting strategies rely on several strong assumptions, and I do not think that they would work in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">First, the private sector has to be sufficiently forward looking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">That is, expectations about future economic conditions must have a significant impact on today’s economic decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Second, the private sector has to fully understand the strategy and its implications for monetary policy implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Finally, the strategy has to be credible, meaning that the private sector must believe that the central bank will indeed, from time to time, deliberately aim for deviations of future inflation from its implicit long-run target to meet its price level target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.38,0)">I have serious doubts that these conditions are satisfied in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.68,0)">And if not, level targeting strategies can easily result in worse stabilisation outcomes than inflation targeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In this context, I think the Hippocratic principle of “do no harm” also provides sensible advice for central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Nominal GDP growth targeting Another proposed alternative strategy is nominal GDP growth targeting or, as economists sometimes call it, “speed limit” policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Nominal GDP growth targeting is different from nominal GDP level targeting – as with inflation targeting, past outcomes are not taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.33,0)">Bygones are bygones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.17,0)">Loosely speaking, the nominal GDP target is the sum of an inflation target and an estimate of potential GDP growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.0,0)">The central bank tightens policy whenever nominal GDP growth is above this target and loosens when it is below.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.99,0)">While theoretical analyses suggest that speed limit policies might perform reasonably well in normal times, they are likely to perform rather poorly when policy rates are constrained by the effective lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.35,0)">Following a recession, they imply a much earlier tightening of policy rates than inflation targeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Simple interest rate rules There have been some proposals, especially in the United States, to give a much more prominent role to simple interest rate rules, the most famous example being the Taylor rule, as a guideline for monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">The Taylor rule has been shown to provide a reasonably good ex-post account of movements in the policy interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It suggests that, at any point in time, the short-term interest rate is equal to a constant, plus a weighted sum of the deviations of inflation from target and output from potential, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.54,0)">the output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The alleged advantage of using an interest rate rule to prescribe monetary policy decisions is that it makes monetary policy more predictable and prohibits policymakers from reneging on their policy commitments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.55,0)">By contrast, monetary policy decisions that are not bound by a rule are considered problematic, since they can be driven by short-term considerations and lose sight of their consequences on future expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">A still active research programme has shown that it is possible to design interest rate rules that perform reasonably well across a wide range of macroeconomic models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.27,0)">While I do not dispute the informational content that interest rate rules might provide, I strongly oppose the idea that central banks’ policy rate decisions should be based on these rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.17,0)">The key reason is that any specific rule is unlikely to be suited for all possible contingencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.76,0)">The environment in which monetary policymakers have to act is much more complex than what is assumed in model-based analysis of policy rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.01,0)">A simple rule that responds to one or two macroeconomic variables and ignores all other indicators of price developments is not able to account for the complexities of the real world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.59,0)">It would be especially odd, given the criticism that monetary policy does not take enough account of financial developments, to put in place a strategy that completely ignores them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.96,0)">Monetary policy responses to the financial crisis, which I will describe shortly, are an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.66,0)">Not only did central banks pay increasingly more attention to many new variables, when calibrating policy interest rate to evolving economic and financial conditions but they also had to devise new monetary policy instruments to respond to new types of financial market disruptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.84,0)">What would have happened in the last ten years, if monetary policy had been delegated to a Taylor-rule auto-pilot?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Adjustments to interest rate rules and the Effective Lower Bound   Even though no central bank applies mechanical interest rules, it is nevertheless possible to estimate a posteriori behavioural rules, so that in practice, interest rate decisions can be rationalised in simple regressions dependent on inflation and the output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.5,0)">Such rules are also often used to close models supporting monetary policy analysis or they result as the optimal policy from optimising exercises with macro models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.56,0)">It is therefore useful to use different interest rate rules in models and analyse what their impact on the economy would be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In particular, this is interesting when trying to respond to an important policy question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.22,0)">Given the present low level of inflation how can the risk of interest rates reaching the Effective Lower Bound   too often be avoided and can this lead to significant losses in terms of the policy objectives?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.61,0)">Until recently, the conventional wisdom was that the lower bound of interest rates was zero, the so-called Zero Lower Bound  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.2,0)">However, as demonstrated in recent years, the ELB can be below zero, determined by the cost of holding cash instead of remunerated assets, including deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.06,0)">Cash is convenient for transactions but pays no interest and is costly to store securely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.85,0)">It thus loses real value when prices rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.09,0)">Conversely, bank deposits generally pay interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.72,0)">Should bank deposits start being charged at negative interest rates depositors would have incentives to withdraw their money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.25,0)">As holding cash is not costless, people may tolerate slightly negative interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.2,0)">However, as rates become more negative, depositors would withdraw their money, depriving banks of deposits and causing financial instability and reducing banks’ capacity to extend credit to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.75,0)">It is therefore impossible for nominal interest rates to fall below this ELB, which is negative but dependent on the cost of storing and insuring cash  that nevertheless can be significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Kiley and Roberts   investigate the question of the frequency and costs of hitting the ELB, using stochastic simulations with two models from the Federal Reserve Board  : the FRB/US Model and a DSGE model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.37,0)">Using a simple Taylor Rule with a 2% objective for inflation  and an equilibrium real rate of 1%, they find that, for the FRB/US model, policy interest rates would be at the ELB 38% of the time with GDP 1.1 percentage points   below potential and inflation at 1.2%, so quite a poor performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">The corresponding outcomes for the DSGE model were that policy rates would be 32.5 % of the time at the ELB, with output 2.3 p.p.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.12,0)">below potential and inflation, barely above zero, at 0.1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.62,0)">This illustrates how low levels of inflation and equilibrium real rates can increase the frequency of reaching the ELB with visible deviations from the desirable policy targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Adjustments to the rule are then conceived to overcome this problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Applying a risk adjustment factor to the interest rate  in the FRB/US model, the authors find that, with a 0.5 adjustment, and a real rate of 1%, an objective of 2% inflation could be attained with output closer to potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The introduction of the risk adjustment creates, of course, the risk of inflation being above 2% during some protracted periods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Another attempt is to use a Taylor Rule specified in terms of interest rate changes instead of levels , which improves the performance of both models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.6,0)">In the case of the FRB/US model, results are 29.7% of the time at the ELB, GDP 1.4 p.p.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">below potential and inflation at 1.5% and when the DSGE model is used 10.4% at the ELB, GDP 0.5 p.p.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.33,0)">below potential and 1.6% inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Introducing the commitment to keep the policy rate at the ELB until the targets for the output gap   and for inflation   are met, further improves the results: for the FRB/US model the outcomes for ELB, output gap and inflation are, 22%, 0.1 p.p., 2%, respectively; and 9.6%, 0 p.p., 2% for the DSGE model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">These outcomes indicate that “Policymakers capable of committing to possibly very accommodative policies can essentially remove the pernicious effects of the ELB”  which is a comforting thought for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">A final possibility to avoid the dangers of falling into the ELB too often would be to increase the inflation target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Raising the inflation target Several experts have argued that while central banks may want to stick to the inflation targeting framework, this target should be raises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.18,0)">Arguments for a higher inflation target are typically related to the ELB on nominal interest rates, which constrains interest rate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.3,0)">The first argument in favour of raising the inflation target states that the announcement of an increase in the inflation target raises private sector inflation expectations, which lowers real interest rates even if nominal rates are stuck near the lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Lower real rates stimulate consumption and investment and help to raise inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">The second argument says that a higher inflation target increases the buffer against the ELB on nominal interest rates in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Remember that in the long run, an increase in the inflation target translates into an increase in nominal interest rates of the same size, providing central banks with more room to lower interest rates in response to contractionary disturbances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.29,0)">The argument for raising the inflation target to create a buffer against occasional episodes of binding effective lower bound on the nominal interest rate is usually made in the context of transitory declines in the equilibrium real rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.78,0)">A stronger version of this argument applies if faced with a situation in which the equilibrium real rate is permanently lower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">According to standard growth theory, the equilibrium real interest rate has some relation to long-run productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">So this touches on the so-called “secular stagnation” hypothesis recently reinvigorated by Gordon, Krugman, Summers and others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.82,0)">Indeed, there is evidence of declining productivity since the 70s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.96,0)">The issue is whether, and to what extent, the recent Great Recession and the resulting slow deleveraging process have exacerbated this trend, generating permanent costs from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.79,0)">This is a topic of heated debate at present, not only in the policy arena, but also in academic circles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.19,0)">All in all, these arguments have merits, particularly for central banks with a dual mandate that includes output stabilisation, but they are too narrowly focused on the benefits associated with staying away from the ELB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.74,0)">As going below the ELB is not possible, fighting recessions and the resulting high unemployment rate becomes more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Increasing the inflation target real interest rates could then be effective to eliminate negative output and unemployment gaps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">These benefits of a higher inflation target can be outweighed by the broader costs of higher inflation, depending on the chosen level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.33,0)">Historically, relatively higher inflation has usually been associated with more volatile inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Moreover, the ECB and many other inflation-targeting central banks have shown that other monetary policy tools are available when interest rates cannot be lowered further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.51,0)">Against this background, the desirability of higher inflation targets becomes very controversial as economic theory could never specify with certainty the most desirable level within the range of low inflation values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.2,0)">Since the 90s most central banks defined 2% as the appropriate inflation objective, in some cases admitting temporary small deviations around that level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">In the case of the ECB, the inflation objective is to maintain in the medium-term a level below, but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Should non-standard monetary policy tools become standard?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Let me now turn to the monetary policy toolkit to be employed in order to achieve central bank targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">More specifically, should the size and composition of the central bank balance-sheet be now thought as a conventional tool?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Should the use of negative short-term interest rates be exploited more systematically, and possibly facilitated, in reaction to deep recessions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Should central banks exploit innovative transmission mechanisms, for example those suggesting that interest rates should be increased to jolt the economy away from an ultra-low inflation trap?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.69,0)">Size and composition of central bank balance sheets Traditionally, central banks used only short-term interest rates to steer the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.14,0)">A simplified account of the transmission mechanism works as follows: changes in short-term rates are quickly transmitted to other financial market prices, including longer-term rates and lending rates; these changes translate into changes in real rates, because prices tend to remain sticky in the short-run; in turn, real rates affect aggregate and in turn inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">As central banks began in the 80s to abandon technical monetarism and adopt interest rates as the main policy instrument to influence economic and financial conditions, their monetary base has adjusted towards the level consistent with banks’ demand for reserves, given the current short-term interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.47,0)">The central bank balance sheet, which is to a large extent determined by bank reserves in the perspective of the traditional transmission channels, cannot therefore be used as a monetary policy instrument separate from the short-term interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.82,0)">This traditional understanding changed dramatically with the outbreak of the global financial crisis in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Since then, the ECB, like many other central banks, has started using its balance sheet as an additional monetary policy instrument while considering other transmission channels to the economy beyond technical monetarism or interest rate effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the first phase of the crisis, marked by the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the balance sheet was used together with the short-term interest rate as a way to offset impairments in the monetary policy transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.55,0)">For example, lending rates in some countries did not respond to cuts in short-term rates, as interbank markets dried up and became segregated along national lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The ECB responded to the emerging liquidity shortage by providing ample liquidity, at increasingly long durations and against a wider range of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">As of 2014, the nature of balance sheet policies changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.6,0)">The euro area had entered a prolonged downturn as banks in large parts of the euro area further reduced lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.63,0)">The sharp fall in oil prices that began in late summer added further disinflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.78,0)">In this environment of persistently low inflation rates, the risk of a de-anchoring of private sector inflation expectations was encountered, potentially giving rise to self-reinforcing second-round effects and deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.04,0)">Yet with interest rates already close to zero, our ability to use conventional monetary policy to provide additional accommodation was constrained, and we turned to the balance sheet as an unconventional tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In the second half of 2014, the ECB started to buy asset-backed securities   under the ABS purchase programme   as well as covered bonds under a third covered bond purchase programme  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In January 2015, the ECB announced its expanded asset purchase programme  , including government bonds, to fight the risk of the period of low inflation becoming too prolonged, thereby significantly expanding the monetary base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">A broader range, beyond traditional transmission channels, was considered, comprising: the direct effect on securities prices purchased and respective lowering of medium-term rates; the portfolio rebalancing by banks and non-bank investor that get liquidity and will buy other assets spreading these effects to other asset classes; finally, the signalling effect influencing expectations of future inflation and the likely path of the key policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The APP allowed us to further apply downward pressure on the term structure of interest rates by compressing risk premia out along the yield curve and improving private sector financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Quantitative Easing   has been effective both in the U.S. and in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The concept of a “shadow interest rate”  has been used to calculate the effect of unconventional measures   in a comparable way with policy interest rates when these are constrained by the ELB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.55,0)">The term structure of interest rates is used to find “What policy rate would generate the observed yield curve if the policy rate could be taken negative?”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">As we have seen, holding cash provides protection against negative interest rates that could attain significant values in the absence of cash as an alternative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.68,0)">A shadow curve is obtained from calculating the value of a call option to hold cash at the ZLB and subtracting it from the actual yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.78,0)">Several methods to calculate the shadow rates based on different models of the yield curve produce different outcomes, which somewhat diminishes the practical usefulness of the concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Balance sheet measures have contributed to a major easing of euro area financing conditions and, through this channel, a more robust and sustained economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Given their effectiveness, what role should central banks’ balance sheets play in the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">An important question is to investigate, in the case of a continued low inflation regime with low interest rates, whether a conventional monetary policy of using interest rates would be sufficient to address the next recessionary episode.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Using the FRB/US model, Reifschneider    analyses several scenarios and concludes that both forward-guidance and QE would be necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Beyond this justification, there are good arguments to preserve the instrument in the policy toolkit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.62,0)">They stem from structural changes that have occurred in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In particular the increased role of secured money market transactions; the importance of a broad set of market rates beyond the overnight rate; the growing relevance of non-bank institutions in market-based finance; and finally, the scarcity of safe assets that affects the functioning of markets and the management of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">These arguments are behind proposals recently presented in Jackson Hole by Duffie and Krishnamurthy, and by Greenwood, Hanson and Stein.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">They stress the importance of the Fed’s reverse repurchase agreement   programme   through which it repos against cash securities it has in its balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">The first group of authors advocate using the programme to involve more counterparties and to affect several interest rates, thereby contributing to a better transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.24,0)">Recent internal work at the ECB also detects similar pass-through imperfections in European markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The second set of authors consider the necessity of central banks keeping a big balance sheet as a way to steer the supply of safe assets, particularly through RRP, to create very short-term safe assets, fostering greater financial stability by avoiding the unsuccessful attempts by the private sector to fulfil that role, as seen before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is an important issue as the attempt to create private safer assets was behind the expansion of a shadow banking sector that played a significant role in the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">An appropriate concept of shadow banking conflates entities and activities involved in a vast array of services related to securitisation, repos and securities financing transactions  , as well as OTC derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The latter allow for risk transformation and exchange via swaps, comprising credit default swaps, interest rate or forex swaps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Several of these activities can be conducted either by regulated banks or by non- regulated institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Two aspects make these activities relevant: first, they contribute to the creation of a credit system based on secured short-term market funding; second, these new liquidity instruments are akin to money but are not counted in the usual monetary aggregates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">These two features – the emergence of a new market credit system and the significance of new forms of money– is what justifies the “shadow banking” designation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The origins of this new credit system relate to the emergence of very sizeable cash pools that could not find safety in banks’ insured deposits and were in search of safer forms of placing that cash in the short-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Securitisation, with tranches and enhanced ratings, repos creating inside liquidity as well as risk transformation and exchange via OTC derivatives were the three main instruments created to place these “safer” private short-term assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.05,0)">The crisis came when crashing housing prices raised doubts about securitisations and when chains of inside liquidity created by repos with re-hypothecation and re-use of the same securities  collapsed with rising haircuts and resulting illiquid markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.84,0)">That is why Gary Gorton characterises the 2007/2008 financial crisis as a “run on repo”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.23,0)">We live now in a collaterised financial system where unsecured interbank transactions have been continuously declining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.91,0)">The increased demand for safe assets and the relative shortage of official sector safe assets were responsible for the attempt to create private “safer” assets whose value proved to be illusory at the first stressful situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.49,0)">This shortage of safe assets facing a huge demand is one of the important causes behind the very low levels of government bonds yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.0,0)">As Caballero and Farhi   stated “Short-term rates feature a widely noted downward secular trend and a sharp drop during the Great Recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.31,0)">The evolution of the expected return on equity is markedly different: It features the same downward trend as the short-term interest rate until the early 2000s but then remains more or less stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.64,0)">The disconnect between a stable expected return on equity and a declining short-term interest rate is particularly salient after 2002, and even more so since the beginning of the Great Recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.8,0)">…The stark divergence between safe and risky expected rates of return is suggestive of an increased shortage of safe assets”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.62,0)">The disconnect between low rates of government bonds and the real rates of return of capital invested by non-financial firms, indicates that any concept of natural rate of interest cannot simply be a result of the marginal productivity of real capital as Wicksell and other neo-classical economists believed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.82,0)">On the other hand, the excess of demand for official safe assets pushed up their prices i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.62,0)">lowered their yields until they reached levels near the ZLB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.08,0)">When interest rates could no longer adjust down to establish market equilibrium, the adjustment variable became the output moving into a recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.61,0)">At the international level, the loss of interest rates as an equilibrium variable made rendered the exchange rate the variable of interest which provoked a type of “currency wars”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">These explanations back the calls by Krishnamurthy et al   and Greenwood et al   for sizeable central bank balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.43,0)">Unlike in the U.S. where the share of deposits in total bank funding has gradually declined, deposits and corporate bonds still account for the bulk of financing in Europe, with ABS and money-like debt playing only a marginal role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In fact, the predominantly bank-based nature of the European financial system allows us to consider the possibility of going back to a “leaner” balance sheet, once the situation is normalised, with lending to banks remaining the main channel for managing liquidity and steering short-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The rationale behind the “lean” balance sheet is to minimise the intermediation role of the central bank and related potential market distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Nevertheless, the structural changes that I just mentioned may also start taking place in Europe eventually and we have to reflect on the possible limitations of monetary policy transmission by only influencing the very short end of money-market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The discussion of which interest rates to focus on is closely intertwined with the issue of central bank counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The ECB has traditionally granted access to monetary policy operations to a broad range of financially sound credit institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">That approach enabled us to swiftly provide liquidity to various financial market segments during the crisis, when more active central bank intermediation was warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Nevertheless, non-banks are beginning to play a greater role in the European financial landscape, and are likely to take an even greater role as the capital markets union deepens and broadens financial markets in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This development is not neutral for market rates in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.18,0)">Secured money market rates, backed by high quality collateral, have for a while been trading well below the ECB deposit facility rate, which normally sets a floor for short-term money market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.87,0)">In part, this discount is explained by the activity of non-banks who do not have access to central bank facilities and are accepting interest rates below the deposit facility rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.96,0)">The discount is, of course, also attributed to the APP which has reduced the availability of high quality collateral at the same time as market demand for that collateral has increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Understanding the root causes of these observed outcomes better is crucial for the central bank when making decisions about future counterparty eligibility and the choice of money market rates used to assess monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.49,0)">Negative interest rates A notable addition to the ECB’s set of non-conventional tools has been negative nominal interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.49,0)">The ECB first introduced a negative interest rate on its deposit facility in June 2014, setting it initially to -0.10%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.4,0)">Later, the ECB lowered the deposit facility rate further in three steps to -0.40% by March 2016 and has kept it at that level ever since.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.77,0)">Other central banks, including those of Denmark, Switzerland, Sweden and Japan, have also experimented with negative policy rates in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.85,0)">A negative nominal interest rate on the deposit facility means that commercial banks must pay for parking their deposits with the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It incentivises credit creation and a greater velocity of circulation of excess reserves held at the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Negative rates stimulate the economy via the usual channels: lowering real yields and bank lending rates at various maturities, encouraging borrowing and real activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.25,0)">In this context, negative policy rates have been an effective tool in the euro area, lowering not only short-term rates but also rates at longer maturities via expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The successful use of negative policy rates in the euro area and in other countries suggests that this instrument may become part of the conventional toolkit of central banks for fighting recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.94,0)">However, one needs to take into account that there is still an effective lower bound on nominal interest rates as discussed earlier: the presence of non-trivial costs of storing and handling currency means that the effective lower bound is somewhere below zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.57,0)">From an economic perspective, what may be even more important is the possibility that below a certain threshold, called by some economists the “reversal rate”, policy rates going further into negative territory may become counterproductive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.24,0)">This would happen because of the detrimental effect of negative interest rates on bank profitability and lending, especially in an environment in which banks are largely financed with retail deposits at non-negative nominal interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.48,0)">All in all, under current monetary arrangements, negative rates can only be seen as a special tool with limited room for manoeuvre, to be used only in extreme circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">This has always been the actual intention underlying the ECB negative rate policy – to boost aggregate demand, closing the output gap more quickly, helping to normalise inflation and subsequently interest rates in the wake of a particularly severe recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.34,0)">Abolishing cash altogether Given that the limitations in the use of negative rates as a monetary policy tool ultimately stem from the ELB, some economists have entertained even more radical proposals such as: to tax cash to lower the ELB or to eliminate the ELB by abolishing currency altogether.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.16,0)">These would reduce or remove the arbitrage opportunity to escape negative rates by substituting deposits for cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">By removing the lower bound, abolishing cash would provide monetary policy with ample room for manoeuvre in the case of severe cyclical downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.73,0)">Abolishing cash would also hamper some illegal activities and promote transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Last but not least, society would benefit from economising on the costs of storage and use of currency, which are non-trivial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.81,0)">There are in my view however, substantial drawbacks to consider, and reasons why many policymakers are reluctant to seriously consider this proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Cash has survived throughout the centuries as a reliable transaction technology and as a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.73,0)">Its elimination would be a major break with a long-standing social convention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It remains popular: a recent survey carried out for the ECB found that 80% of transactions in the euro area at the point of sale are in cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.86,0)">People who prefer to hold currency may perceive its abolition as an assault on their freedom and in particular, on their right of anonymity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.05,0)">And savers may think the abolition of cash, coupled with a negative nominal interest rate on deposits, as an unfair wealth tax.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.07,0)">There could also be broader macroeconomic instabilities triggered by the abolition of currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.18,0)">The arguments about the risks of persistently low interest rates for financial stability are clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.17,0)">If the lower bound was removed, these risks would presumably increase, especially in the form of asset price bubbles and excessive leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.75,0)">To sum up, while abolishing cash may allow monetary policy to cut interest rates deeper into negative territory in extreme situations, this would come with significant costs of its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">In light of all these uncertainties, a prudent policymaker should be very cautious before proceeding with these radical proposals, even if digitalisation may gain ground and eventually prevail – as we start to observe in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Helicopter money Another old idea which has received renewed attention recently is Friedman’s proposal of using “helicopter money”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.59,0)">Friedman’s helicopter money drop is supposed to exert upward pressure on real activity and inflation because of a wealth effect: real money holdings of private agents rise at a given price level, making private agents wealthier and inducing them to spend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">In a more modern context, one would need to increase private agents’ claims on the public sector, relative to private agents’ liabilities to the public sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.81,0)">The “helicopter money” policy recently proposed however, operates through different channels than those in Friedman’s original thinking: it is expansionary fiscal policy financed by the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.75,0)">There are, however, two types of helicopter money policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The first one is combined with fiscal policy, having the central bank temporarily financing an increase in public expenditure thus avoiding additional public debt issuance and its potential Ricardian effects when debt is very high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The second one is by directly distributing money to consumers by means of crediting their deposit accounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.87,0)">This could be done by the Treasury as a form of expenditure or by the central bank itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Both cases can therefore be seen as examples of fiscal policy with monetary financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The Treasury would increase expenditure   and the central bank would credit the Treasury account against a perpetual bond   with a zero coupon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.38,0)">A debate ensued about whether this would be cheaper than normal bond financing when the central bank is doing QE and paying interest on the bank reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.0,0)">When consolidating the central bank account in the public sector, the maturity of public debt is changed from the perpetual bond into short term liabilities   the central bank has towards the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">If bank reserves are remunerated and all rates near zero, then monetary financing would not be much cheaper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.12,0)">On the other hand, if bank reserves are not remunerated, this would be a hidden tax on banks as a real cost of monetary financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Notwithstanding the costs of the two ways of financing the accrued deficit  , some conclude that the use of helicopter money would have practically the same effect as increasing the budget deficit by issuing a bond and implementing QE.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">QE would purchase and replace the issued bond   by another public sector debt  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This reasoning assumes that either form of financing would have the same impact on private expenditure which would only be true if all economic agents with Ricardian behaviour, in forming their expectations, would consolidate the central bank and the Treasury balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This is however not likely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Monetary financing can therefore be more effective as it disguises the fact that there is an increase in government debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.65,0)">This is reinforced by the fact that the majority of consumers does not see very long-run budget constraints and does not decide on the basis of “permanent income”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">As Muellbauer    states: “The research of Deaton  , Carroll   and Kaplan et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.19,0)">suggests that, faced with liquidity constraints and individual uninsurable income risk, most households have a much more short-term outlook on the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.52,0)">Overt monetary finance or cash distributions to households are therefore likely to have a demand-stimulating effect just when it is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.45,0)">However, “helicopter money” type of policy is forbidden by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union which clearly prohibits direct financing of fiscal policy that is a competence of governments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The Neo-Fisherian view The experience of Japan in the last two decades has motivated a more radical theoretical idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.32,0)">Persistent ultra-low policy interest rates may not be the right medicine for lifting inflation close to the target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">While this idea may be of limited practical relevance, it is important to understand its logic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.52,0)">The view maintained by a small but influential group of economists is that low interest rate policies are in fact just validating beliefs that deflation in the current circumstances is inevitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">These economists argue that central banks should instead adopt an entirely different framework, known as Neo-Fisherianism, in order to lift inflation from its undesirably low rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.62,0)">Their analysis starts with the so-called Fisher equation, which is present in modern macroeconomic models with Euler equations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.56,0)">The Fisher equation postulates that the current real interest rate equals the difference between the current nominal interest rate and inflation expected in the following period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.09,0)">The Fisher equation: i = r* + πᵉ In its simplest form, Neo-Fisherianism argues that the real interest rate   is determined by real factors independent of monetary policy in the long-run, and hence a permanent rise in the nominal interest rate must be followed by a corresponding increase in inflation in the long-run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.99,0)">It is a long-term view that inverts the original equation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">The proponents accept that in the short-run, an increase in the interest rate would lower expenditure and GDP, consequently lowering inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.26,0)">The main challenge for this view has been to spell out the market forces that would push inflation up in the wake of a nominal rate hike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Inflation expectations here are assumed to automatically adjust upwards to the new higher nominal interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.18,0)">It is as if firms look at high nominal interest rates, associate them with high inflation and simply raise their prices accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.87,0)">A slightly more elaborate version of the argument is based on a modern specification of the demand for change in output in a DSGE model stemming from an Euler equation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.44,0)">Writing a simple model with an output gap and inflation, we have : 1) yt = Et yt+1 - σ -1   2) πt = κyt + β Et πt+1 The model could be closed by treating the rate of interest i as exogenous or adding a Taylor-type interest rate rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.23,0)">Ignoring for simplicity, the second term in the right hand side of 2) and substituting equation 2) in equation 1) we have a deterministic   equilibrium as a solution to 3) πt = πt+1 - κσ -1   In the long-run steady state when is constant, the expression in parenthesis has to equal zero, which implies the verification of the Fisher equation i = r* + π* or π* = i - r* where π* is the long-run equilibrium inflation rate dependent on i which is fixed by the monetary authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">A more advanced way of presenting the neo-fisherian view is reflected on a series of papers by Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe   , 2014 and 2017).</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The authors show that in simple DSGE models with a ZLB and Taylor Rule type of equation, obeying the Taylor principle of an inflation coefficient higher than one, there are two or more equilibria and there is a path from the good equilibrium with positive inflation to a bad equilibrium of very low or negative inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.15,0)">In a liquidity trap, the Taylor rule does not work and the Fisher equation takes charge, leading to a steady-state equilibrium of low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The only way to steer the economy to the good equilibrium is to increase the interest rate and wait for agents with rational expectations to lead the economy for the good long-run level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.29,0)">Several economists reacted against such a pure theoretical conjecture as it does not explain how the economy would go from the bad equilibrium to the good one when other equilibria may also exist in these models, implying trajectories with very protracted recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.01,0)">Woodford and García-Schmidt    show why it is not correct to just assume that “that the outcome associated with a given policy commitment should be a perfect foresight equilibrium, even when the commitment is fully credible  .We argue that predicting what should happen as a result of a particular policy commitment requires that one models the cognitive process by which one imagines people to arrive at particular expectations taking that information into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.48,0)">Rather, we deny the practical relevance of the perfect foresight solutions   of the model under the thought experiment of a permanent interest-rate peg”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In reality, other outcomes of the policy experiment are possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.04,0)">There are many trajectories that output and inflation may follow before reaching their higher long-run level and some trajectories may imply very protracted recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">There is no reason to discard the practical relevance of these alternative outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.33,0)">Neo-Fisherianism will remain a theoretical academic curiosity that will not be a part of future monetary frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Recent developments in the euro area support this belief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Rather than increasing its key interest rates, the ECB has kept them at near-zero level for a very long period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This policy is working and euro area inflation is starting to adjust towards levels consistent with the ECB price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">A sustainable adjustment has not yet occurred, but it comforts our belief that we have moved our interest rate tool in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Concluding remarks Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The extraordinary events of the past decade have encouraged a vigorous debate on the optimal strategy and conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Such debate is always welcome and it is important for central banks to reassure themselves, as well as the public, that they are carrying out their mandates in the best possible way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Judging by the opinion of a majority of central bank governors and academics,  the prediction is that monetary policy will try to keep the flexible inflation targeting regime, coupled hopefully with some form of macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">This would imply a return to leaner balance sheets and interest rates as main policy instruments, keeping nevertheless other tools available for less regular situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">I believe that this strategy of flexible inflation target also works for the euro area and can remain central to any future monetary policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">However, one of the lessons from the crisis is the need for better mechanisms to mitigate financial stability risks with central banks being given more macroprudential tools to complement their policy toolkit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In part, the ECB’s new competences for macroprudential policy, albeit incipient, will certainly help in that direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">In the future, once sustainable convergence to our inflation objective has been achieved, the management of short-term interest rates should again become the main monetary policy tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">However, we should not try to predict what the more distant future may bring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For instance, it is not certain that the Eurosystem’s balance sheet will go all the way back to the pre-crisis levels as the future normal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.71,0)">This may not be the case, especially if the unsecured interbank market continues to shrink thus requiring the Eurosystem to aim at a broader spectrum of interest rates as well as to focus on other types of transmission channels or even other counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">In fact, central banks should remain open to ways of addressing future challenges as the financial system architecture evolves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.6,0)">The cautionary tale implied by the crisis is that central banks should keep in their toolkit many instruments that may be necessary in stressful situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.34,0)">Let us not assume that crises will not happen again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.29,0)">As Voltaire said “We should not insult the future by trying to foresee it”.</span>
