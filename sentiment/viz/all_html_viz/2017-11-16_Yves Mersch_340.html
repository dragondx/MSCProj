    <span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)"> Securitisation Revisited Keynote Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Euro Finance Week, Frankfurt am Main, 16 November 2017 Today I would like to come back on an issue that has found some of our attention in the recent past: securitisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.0,0)">What has happened: Is it part of CMU agenda?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.62,0)">It is not helping banks to sanitize their balance sheets more rapidly when there is such a great need?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Simple, transparent and standardised   securitisations Let me start with some good news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The European framework for simple, transparent and standardised or ‘STS’ securitisations was formally adopted by the European Parliament on 26 October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">The adoption by the Council is expected soon and will lead to the conclusion of a process that has taken many years of hard work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The STS Regulation is one of the cornerstones of the Capital Markets Union   project to build a single market for capital in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.51,0)">Some basic beliefs: At the outset I still consider the Great Financial Crisis heaving at its origin excess built-up of leverage especially short term debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.51,0)">We should however not condemn wholesale all debt carrying instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">While we must tackle the stock of legacy debt, the flow of new credit to the economy should not be hampered as it fuels the economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Therefore, a differentiated assessment of financial instruments is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Let me elaborate on the reasons why the ECB is interested in this particular market segment: First, the ABS market acts as one of the transmission channels of our monetary policy, facilitating the provision of credit to the euro area real economy and, thereby, helping us to achieve our monetary policy objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Second, ABS are an important component of the collateral framework of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Third, securitisation, when used well, can transfer risk away from the banking sector, which may support monetary policy as it can help banks free up bank capital, allowing them to extend new credit to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.97,0)">The reputation of securitisation or asset-backed securities   has been severely tarnished by the financial crisis, reflecting both the prominent role of ABS involving complex, opaque structures with poorly underwritten loans and the misuse of derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.43,0)">Moreover, the market was over-reliant on a highly leveraged investor base depending on short-term wholesale funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.23,0)">Although these practices were more prevalent in the US, the European securitisation market was also impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.7,0)">By consequence, all ABS were demonized.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">The ECB together with the Bank of England were early supporters of a better functioning securitisation market for transactions that comply with the concept of simple, transparent and standardised ABS and duly take into account the lessons learnt of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.55,0)">An early intuition was that lack of transparency acted as an obstacle to the revitalisation of the securitisation market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The ECB has made a significant effort to ensure a high degree of transparency in securitisation by promoting the loan-level data initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">STS Regulation also requires a system of registration and supervision for ABS data repositories established in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">‘Securitisation repositories’, as they are called, will be subject to the same ongoing governance, technical and operational requirements as trade repositories under the EMIR framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">They will be expected to store not just loan-level data, but also all other information which the Regulation requires, such as transaction documentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The repositories will be registered, authorised and supervised by ESMA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The ECB will wholeheartedly support ESMA in completing its tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">So far so good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.27,0)">What about results?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.7,0)">It is duly noted, however, that the revival of the European securitisation market is still anaemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.9,0)">Market-placed issuance is at historic lows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.81,0)">The investor base has not recovered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.79,0)">The EU securitisation markets are impacted by bank deleveraging, unfavourable regulatory treatment and lower relative costs of funding of alternative instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Admittedly, the sizeable Eurosystem covered bond purchase programme and long term loan operations have also represented viable funding alternatives for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In this respect, some more patience is warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The STS regulation will only come into force in 2019 as various important technical standards still need to be finalised to provide further regulatory certainty which is important for securitisation market development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">EBA is for example mandated to develop guidelines to ensure a common and consistent understanding of the STS criteria throughout the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">As the ECB has argued in its opinion, this is important to ensure legal certainty and efficiency for those interpreting and applying the STS criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">While these initiatives are helpful in principle, they do not exist in legislative isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.38,0)">We have to be mindful of potential negative spill-over effects by other pieces of legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.43,0)">Let me highlight some areas of concern: First, on a more technical note, under the current European Market Infrastructure Regulation   securitisation special purpose entities   are classified as non-financial counterparties and accordingly, subject to certain conditions, are not required to comply with the clearing and margining obligation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.26,0)">However, according to the May proposal of the Commission to amend the EMIR framework, securitisation entities are reclassified as financial counterparties instead of non-financial counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.2,0)">Therefore, these entities would potentially become subject to mandatory clearing and margining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.07,0)">This would mean that they have to provide collateral, with regards to their derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">This is surprising because securitisation derivatives already contain features to mitigate counterparty credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.12,0)">Moreover, the nature of the securitisation derivatives makes it difficult to comply with the margining or clearing obligation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.19,0)">How can an SPV put down margining as it only has by definition control over its underlying portfolio?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.56,0)">How can it post collateral?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The STS Regulation exempts STS SSPEs from the clearing obligation, provided that counterparty credit risk is adequately mitigated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Further clarity on this is needed as many European securitisation transactions use derivatives for genuine hedging purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Second, the revision of capital charges for STS securitisations in Solvency II is essential for the recovery of the investor base.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">An updated calibration should consider the difference in the risk profile and tolerance between insurance companies and banks and the capacity of the STS criteria to capture a lower risk profile in securitisations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The calibration should not incentivise insurance companies to seek investments in the underlying assets in question in an un-securitised, rather than a more liquid securitised, format.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Third, the potential benefits of securitisation are twofold: it can be used as a way to fund an asset and as a means of transferring risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">It can free up bank capital, allowing banks to extend new credit to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Likewise, the pricing of risks is more effective when securities are assessed by the market rather than being dormant on banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">All this may support the transmission of monetary policy, where the bank lending channel may otherwise be impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Finally, it may lower borrowing firms’ exposure to re-financing or liquidity risk, thereby increasing banks’ resilience and helping to contain systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">For this potential benefit of securitisation to come to fruition it is of course key that the risk transfers are genuine; in other words, it is necessary that the risk is really transferred to third parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The experience of the crisis showed that this condition was not always met in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">In this respect, I would like to highlight the important work done by EBA in the assessment of the current supervisory practices and the proposals made to further enhance the criteria of significant risk transfer for securitisation in its discussion paper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The ECB places great importance on the health of the European securitisation market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The ABS loan-level initiative has made an important contribution in ensuring a high degree of transparency to enable investors to assess the embedded risks of securitisations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Obviously, ABS had to become safer after the experience of the Great Financial Crisis, in particular with securitized US-subprime mortgages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.49,0)">Regulators and legislators have acted accordingly, and the work has not yet been completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.78,0)">But we should not throw the baby out with the bath water.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Instead, the potential of healthy securitizations should be exploited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">In line with the Commission goal to revive the securitisation market in Europe, in order to broaden investment opportunities for investors and boost lending to households and businesses a number of barriers need yet to be overcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">The STS Regulation could make an important contribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.68,0)">Much work has already been conducted, nevertheless many important technical standards still need to be finalised and some other uncertainties still remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In this context, we have to be mindful amid the interdependencies of different pieces of legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Calibration of Solvency II is essential for insurance companies as investors in securitisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Further clarity of securitisation special purpose entities under the EMIR framework is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.68,0)">Finalisation of Basel III may impact securitisation as a means of transferring risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">These are challenges that lie ahead of us.</span>
