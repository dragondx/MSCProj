    <h1> EU accession - challenges for retail banking </h1>
    <h2> Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the Executive Board, Conference on "Retail Financial Services in the New Europe"European Financial Management and Marketing Association,Warsaw, 28 and 29 April 2003. </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Sirkka Hämäläinen </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)"> EU accession – challenges for retail banking Sirkka Hämäläinen, Member of the Executive Board, Conference on "Retail Financial Services in the New Europe"European Financial Management and Marketing Association,Warsaw, 28 and 29 April 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to have the opportunity to be at this conference organised by the European Financial Management and Marketing Association today and to discuss the challenges for the retail banking sector in the accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Given that I have the benefit of being the first speaker and that I am the only central banker speaking at this conference, allow me to take the freedom to address the issue from a rather wide and policy-oriented perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I would like to speak about the challenges to retail banking stemming from the changing environment and the European integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">These challenges are connected with macroeconomic conditions, changes in regulatory frameworks and strengthening market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I.THE OVERALL ROADMAP TO ACCESSION AND BEYOND Let me start my remarks by briefly outlining the overall roadmap to EU accession and beyond for the countries expected to join the EU in 2004, which are known as the acceding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">All these new Member States of the EU are also aiming to eventually adopt the euro, upon fulfilment of the convergence criteria concerning inflation, the exchange rate, interest rates and public finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">When they join the EU, the new members will participate in the procedures for multilateral economic policy surveillance as set out in the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In the area of monetary policy this implies that the new members should treat their exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest and should aim at achieving and maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The regime choice as such will continue to be the responsibility of the respective countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.54,0)">In the area of fiscal policy the public sector deficit and debt ratios must be restricted in a sustainable way to meet the Treaty conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As economic conditions among the ten countries differ considerably in nominal, real and structural terms, the situation and strategy need to be assessed, and this will be done individually for each country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">After adequate convergence, the new Member States can participate in the multilateral exchange rate mechanism, ERM II, which will further strengthen stability and convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">ERM II is a multilateral arrangement with fixed but adjustable central rates vis-à-vis the euro and with a fluctuation band of +/-15%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Decisions concerning central rates and fluctuation bands are taken by mutual agreement of the participating members including the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In principle, the ECB and the central banks of the ERM II member countries commit themselves to provide automatic and unlimited defence of the exchange rate at the margins of the band.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.91,0)">However, both the ECB and the non-euro area central banks concerned may suspend interventions if these conflict with their primary price stability objectives, and they have the right to initiate a procedure aimed at reconsidering the central rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Participation in ERM II is one of the well-known Maastricht criteria that allow countries to introduce the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Countries have to participate in the ERM II mechanism for a period of two years without severe tensions and without devaluation on a country's own initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">It thereby forms a testing phase for the central rate as well as for the sustainability of the overall convergence process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.49,0)">The convergence process and the need for sustainability pose considerable challenges for the economic policies and the behaviour of the economic agents in the acceding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Discipline is needed in monetary and fiscal policies as well as in the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.41,0)">Market discipline and adjustments in market behaviour depend crucially on market expectations and on the credibility of policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The process is not necessarily an easy one and it affects all areas of the economy, including retail banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.15,0)">BANKING FINANCE 1) Challenges for the banking sector stemming from market forces In addition to the overall macroeconomic challenges, there are specific market pressures on the banking sector stemming from integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.97,0)">In fact, banks in the acceding countries have already been facing quite similar challenges to EU banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Over the past decade the acceding countries have undergone a successful transformation to market economies with largely privatised bank-focused financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.3,0)">Today, these banks are confronted with increased competition, high investment needs and changing customer demands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The responses of the banks are very similar to those in the EU, namely mergers and acquisitions, modifications of business strategies and product innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Moreover, the EU and the acceding countries are highly interrelated from an institutional perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Some of the largest EU banks hold majority stakes in many acceding country financial institutions and have brought in their managerial expertise and funding from the parent institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">However, banks in the acceding countries continue to operate in a somewhat distinct environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.78,0)">Capital markets and the insurance industry are far less developed and competition from these sectors is much less intense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">The trend towards securitisation witnessed in the EU has not yet spread to the acceding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">In these areas there will certainly be changes after EU accession as at least the larger corporations gain access to the EU capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.84,0)">Legislative and regulatory changes are also likely to affect the savings behaviour of households over time and give rise to new forms of savings such as pension funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Due to the fact that financial intermediation in general terms still remains relatively low in acceding countries, the banks in these countries continue to have a stronger potential for growth compared with their EU counterparts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">The prevailing strong bank orientation of the financial systems keeps these institutions in the forefront in pooling savings and risk and in providing credit to households as well as the private corporate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.47,0)">In the recent past, retail banking in acceding countries has experienced a veritable rush of attention as tight competition in wholesale activities has narrowed margins and profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Challenges certainly differ, and will continue to differ, across countries and regions due to a divergent degree of sophistication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.87,0)">In some rural areas where bank relationships are not very common banks face competition from loan co-operative and credit unions that are not subject to the same regulatory framework as banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Internet and telephone banking are on the agenda of many banks, but the technical infrastructure is not necessarily always in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Substantial benefits in access to and the quality of financial services can be expected from this shift of interest towards households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Moreover, the ongoing and strengthening integration of retail services across the enlarged EU is likely to significantly enhance economic growth potentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This development should boost public support for further convergence and integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">2) Challenges for the banking sector stemming from regulation The accession process has had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on the framework in which banks operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Also in this area, substantial progress has already been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.67,0)">All acceding countries have closed Chapter 3, "The freedom to provide services", and Chapter 4, "The free movement of capital", the chapters of the acquis communautaire that are most closely linked to banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">They have thus achieved a minimum degree of harmonisation with the EU regulations that will enable them to successfully operate in the single European market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">However, most countries have also agreed on transitional periods in some areas, particularly in the area of deposit and investor protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">These safety nets are particularly relevant in retail banking, where they aim to protect unsophisticated savers and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.38,0)">Divergent safety net coverage in different institutions may distort competition and/or cause confusion among clients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">As many banks in the acceding countries are part of an EU banking group, support from parent institutions is generally expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">However, the subsidiaries – as well as locally owned banks – differ from the branches of EU financial institutions and will be covered by different protection schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The accession date will by no means represent a kind of finishing line in the adjustment process; rather, it marks the start of participation in a higher league.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">From next year, the financial markets of the acceding countries will be part of the single European financial market and will thus have the freedom to provide services under a single passport.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The EU financial markets are not only widening, as evidenced by the accession process, but also deepening, as reflected in the moves towards further integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The new members will be part of this deepening process in the same way as the current members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">A flagship of the deepening process is a series of measures included in the Financial Services Action Plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">These measures also cover retail financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">With the removal of the remaining barriers to the cross-border provision of retail financial services, competition can be expected to increase more rapidly in this segment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Timely preparation by both the private sector and the supervisory authorities for these changes, as well as the sound transposition, implementation and enforcement of the changes, will be crucial for both the short and the long-term success of these measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The ongoing global-level reform of the regulatory framework for banking supervision, known as "Basel II", deserves particular attention when assessing the future challenges for EU banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The new framework will apply from end-2006 to all banks on an individual level as well as on a consolidated level in the EU, irrespective of their size and scope of activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The framework will put very high demands on banks' risk management capacities as well as on the resources of the supervisory authorities in what will then be an enlarged EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">There is a need to start collecting data immediately so that more advanced approaches can be used as soon as the new regulatory framework enters into force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">This is crucial from the point of view of a level playing-field, since the planned incentive structure within Basel II allows for a slightly lower capital requirement for a given exposure if a more sophisticated risk management approach is adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The preservation of financial stability and consumer confidence, the objective of Basel II, is fundamental for effective financial intermediation in all banking activities, including retail banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Supervisory authorities and those national central banks which are responsible for supervision have already been working in close co-operation within the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The acceding countries will be included in this co-operation now that they have obtained observer status in all the different EU and ECB bodies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.86,0)">CHALLENGES FOR BANKS RELATED TO PAYMENT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENTS The transmission of customer payments is one of the central activities in the banking sector which is significantly affected by integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.42,0)">Payment systems are naturally linked to currencies rather than countries, and the introduction of the single currency means that it is no longer warranted to have such a large number of different systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">One of the statutory tasks of the Eurosystem, according to the Treaty, is to ensure the smooth operation of payment systems, and that is why I find it important to specifically reflect on these issues for retail banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">When fulfilling its tasks in the area of payment and settlement systems, the Eurosystem acts as an overseer setting safety and efficiency standards, as a catalyst for change, and as an operator of payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Its role is different in the fields of large-value payment services, retail payments and securities settlement services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In the area of large-value payments, where systemic risk is important, the Eurosystem has an important oversight function with regard to all systems and an operational function in running its own payment system, the Trans-European Automated Real-time Gross settlement Express Transfer system, or TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.01,0)">Retail payment systems have a lower potential to generate systemic risk or to build up a threat to the financial soundness of their participants, but they may have implications in terms of confidence in the payment instruments, systems and, ultimately, the currency in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">That is why the Eurosystem also has an interest in retail payment systems and payment instruments, but here it acts mainly as a catalyst – or rather, a facilitator – for their enhancement, particularly with regard to safety and efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This catalyst role is performed via co-operation with other authorities and the markets, and in particular through the Eurosystem's contacts and relationships with the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.7,0)">1) Challenges for payment systems stemming from regulatory requirements Despite the fact that the euro was introduced for cashless payments in January 1999 and the Eurosystem has strongly encouraged integration in the retail payments area, initial progress was very slow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This led the European Parliament and the Council to issue a Regulation on cross-border payments in euro in December 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The Regulation lays down rules to ensure that charges for cross-border payments in euro are the same as those for domestic payments in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The Eurosystem did not support using a regulation as a tool to improve the efficiency of payments, but it shares the basic objectives of integration behind the Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.75,0)">The Regulation concerning payments in euro is directly applicable to all EU Member States and it will immediately affect acceding countries once they have joined the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">There is therefore a need for these countries to implement some of the basic requirements of the Regulation as soon as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Within the EU, the banking industry is now actively moving towards integrated systems with a higher degree of efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The banking community has committed itself to the creation of a Single Euro Payments Area   and has set up the European Payments Council to govern this project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The purpose of the SEPA initiative is to make all euro payments "domestic", and to make cross-border payments within the euro area as safe and efficient as national payments today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">The ultimate goal of the SEPA is the establishment of a pan-European payment infrastructure for the safe and efficient processing and settlement of all euro payments, irrespective of whether the originator and the beneficiary are from the same EU country or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">For its part, the Eurosystem promotes the SEPA project vis-à-vis all stakeholders, namely the banking industry, the European Commission, EU and national legislators, standard-setting bodies, and users of payment infrastructures and instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">In order to ensure a level playing-field, the Eurosystem is also developing a harmonised oversight framework, which aims in particular to establish a high minimum common security level for retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At the same time, it closely monitors and investigates innovations that will change the way in which retail payments are made, for instance electronic and mobile payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.69,0)">In principle, if the markets failed to deliver a safe integrated system, the Eurosystem would also have the possibility of getting involved in retail payments at the operational level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.95,0)">However, there are currently no plans to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The role of the Eurosystem in the retail payments area thus clearly differs from that in the area of large-value payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This is natural for two main reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">First, secure and efficient wholesale systems are a major precondition for the stability of the banking system and the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Second, the single monetary policy that has been operating since the beginning of 1999 was only possible because the Eurosystem organised and guaranteed the infrastructure for the real-time wholesale money market in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Through the definition and enforcement of their oversight policies, the ECB and the EU national central banks have managed to contain the systemic risks inherent in large-value payment systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The TARGET system provides a tool for the quick and safe transfer of euro funds throughout the euro area and the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Indeed, TARGET has facilitated the implementation of the ECB's monetary policy and the development of a well integrated single euro money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Participation in TARGET will only become necessary for the central bank of an acceding country when that country adopts the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Nevertheless, the Governing Council of the ECB has decided that the acceding country central banks will have the same possibility – but not the obligation – as the current non-euro area central banks to connect to the existing TARGET system once they have joined the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">When they join the euro area, the acceding countries will not only need to be connected to TARGET for the transfer of central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">They will also need efficient and integrated securities clearing and settlement infrastructures for transferring the collateral needed in monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.67,0)">This is a real challenge for the acceding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The current TARGET system is a decentralised one, but the Governing Council of the ECB has already made a strategic decision on the next generation of the TARGET system, TARGET2, which will be based on the principle of "less platforms than central banks".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It will include a "shared Eurosystem component", i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">an IT platform used jointly by a   number of EU central banks willing to give up their own platform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">These decisions will have major implications for the future of the acceding countries, and the participation of these countries as observers in the preparatory work of the Eurosystem is thus very important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">2) Challenges for payment systems stemming from market forces In general, the national payment and securities clearing and settlement infrastructures in the acceding countries seem to be largely adequate to their membership of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.96,0)">However, substantial work remains to be done in these areas before joining the euro area, and there are many challenges stemming not only from the needs of monetary policy but also from market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In principle, information and telecommunication technologies as well as the internet allow the entire payment process to be fully automated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The migration towards fully electronic and highly automated payment services – electronification – which has been the trend over the past decades will strengthen further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In line with its statutory responsibility to promote the smooth operation of payment systems, the ECB also has a role in the field of the electronification of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The main aim is to promote the efficiency and security of these instruments and related systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Here, the ECB again facilitates co-operation between the stakeholders and provides analyses and statistics to support integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The electronic Payment Systems Observatory  , which was transferred some time ago from the Commission to the ECB, will form the channel for communication to all interested parties in the e-payments area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Once the use of electronic payments has moved beyond early development, the ECB's oversight function might become more important than its facilitator role in this area too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">– Let me take the opportunity here to recommend to you an article on the "Electronification of payments in Europe", to be published in the May issue of the ECB's Monthly Bulletin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The range of payment instruments available in acceding countries on the whole seems to be increasing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.23,0)">Cash is still heavily used in retail transactions, and credit transfers are the most frequently used cashless instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.66,0)">In most acceding countries cheques play only a marginal role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Payment cards are also frequently used, although mainly for cash withdrawals at automated teller machines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The number of point of sale terminals is still rather limited, but steadily growing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.55,0)">Direct debit schemes are still clearly underdeveloped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">While in the existing EU countries each inhabitant has on average at least 1.5 bank accounts, in some acceding countries only a small share of the population is able to make payments from an account held with a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.98,0)">The fact that salaries, pensions, social benefits and payments to public utilities are still frequently paid in cash does not encourage efficiency in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">I am certain that banks and the relevant authorities will find a way to change this situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The ECB has assessed the payments infrastructure in the acceding countries and found it sufficiently robust to ensure that it will not generate systemic risks in the enlarged EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The systems in place for the settlement of payments in the domestic currency seem to a large extent to be compliant with EU/Eurosystem safety standards, or to be being brought into line with these standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">But there is certainly room for improvement and determined efforts should be made to standardise rules and procedures to the largest possible extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">In view of entry into the EU and, at a later stage, EMU, international standards and message formats should be promoted and implemented as quickly as possible, in order to allow for the fully automated straight-through processing and interoperability of systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">The urgent challenge for banks is to create incentives for their clients to submit payment orders electronically and to minimise the processing costs as much as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">CONCLUDING REMARKS The accession process has for several years already involved the Eurosystem on the one hand and the central banks and financial market counterparties of the acceding countries on the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">An in-depth policy dialogue and technical assistance activities were initiated at a very early stage, and continue to be maintained by the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">We naturally stand ready to further intensify this co-operation in all areas where it is seen to be useful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.35,0)">The integration process and changing environment mean that financial industries as well as the central banks of Europe will face considerable challenges in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Banks in the acceding countries will have to catch a moving train when joining the European Union and, at a later stage, the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Each new member has tailored and will continue to develop its own strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Here, I would like to underline two specific issues: first, the necessity to see that the development of the payment and securities clearing and settlement infrastructure is given enough weight in the strategy of integration into the EU and the euro area, and second, the need for banks in the acceding countries to closely participate in the development of the banking industry's Single Euro Payments Area initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The pursuit of close co-operation in all areas is strongly encouraged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">In spite of the large challenges involved, I personally am optimistic about the success of the present enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">This optimism is also based on past EU experience with the previous four rounds of enlargement, although the dimension of this most recent round is unprecedented.</span>
