    <h1> Between low interest rates and bond purchases - has European monetary policy reached a dead end? </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Hohenheim University, Stuttgart, 9 October 2017 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.41,0)"> Between low interest rates and bond purchases - has European monetary policy reached a dead end?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Hohenheim University, Stuttgart, 9 October 2017   Central bankers could lead such an easy and quiet life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">They are independent, they have a clear goal – price stability – and they have a powerful tool to reach it – the interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.15,0)">Along these lines, in 2000 Mervyn King claimed that: “A successful central bank should be boring.” He added that a central bank should be “like a referee whose success is judged by how little his or her decisions intrude into the game itself.” Well, that was 17 years ago, and we all know that history can change course in an instant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.29,0)">That’s what happened in autumn 2008 when the financial crisis erupted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Looking back, the signs had been there for quite some time – hindsight is always 20/20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.2,0)">For about a year before the crisis, tremors in the financial system could already be felt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.29,0)">But on 15 September 2008, the big earthquake finally struck.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.98,0)">On that day, an American investment bank failed: Lehman Brothers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.57,0)">The US government did not step in to support it, confounding market expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.9,0)">That was a sound decision in principle, but it sent the markets into a tailspin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The panic button had been well and truly pressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.18,0)">Within a few days, the crisis had spread around the globe and brought the financial system to the brink of collapse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.81,0)">The situation eventually stabilised, but that was not the end of the story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.96,0)">In the wake of the financial crisis, the global economy entered what we now call the “Great Recession”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.9,0)">Shortly afterwards, the euro area went through a banking and sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.35,0)">And the life of central bankers?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Well, it changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.76,0)">Their institutions were no longer referees, as Mervyn King had said; they had become players in the game.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.63,0)">For some time, it even seemed as if they were the only players on the pitch, in particular when other policymakers were unable to react quickly to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.88,0)">Central banks became crisis managers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">For the ECB, this meant that its goal remained the same – maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.26,0)">However, achieving that goal suddenly became much more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.1,0)">It had to reach deeper into its toolbox than it ever had before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It had to find new ways to use existing tools, and even invent entirely new ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.79,0)">All this made some people uneasy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.54,0)">Particularly here in Germany, people see the new role and the new tools of the ECB as something risky.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.49,0)">They are concerned that the low interest rates might destroy future wealth and ruin their retirement plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Outside Germany, however, the ECB has won respect for its forceful response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.51,0)">People are focusing on the fact that the ECB helped to prevent worse things from happening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">And some might even think that it could have done more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.8,0)">So which view is right?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Did the ECB save the euro and protect Europe from a crisis that could have been much worse?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.64,0)">Or has it overreached and entered a dead-end road where it will eventually get stuck?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.93,0)">This is a tricky question because, while it seems to focus on the past, it’s the future which holds the answer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">So let us do three things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.63,0)">First, let’s look back and ask what has happened so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Second, let’s take a look at the present and ask where we are right now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And third, let’s look ahead and ask where we go from here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.17,0)">The past – thinking outside the  box So the past is where we begin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.92,0)">In this case, 15 September 2008 – the day Lehman Brothers failed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.71,0)">And that was the death blow for something that was already severely wounded: trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.49,0)">Banks around the world started worrying about their exposures to what were known as subprime mortgage loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.61,0)">Through new financial instruments, the risks from these loans had been spread across the banking sector – in very opaque ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.55,0)">Banks did not know how many of these risks were on the balance sheets of their business partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.03,0)">And they did not know how to price these risks on their own balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.29,0)">Trust disappeared; banks stopped lending to each other and the interbank market broke down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.68,0)">There was a high risk that even healthy banks would run short of liquidity and fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.05,0)">That was a serious problem, given how important banks are for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.84,0)">A meltdown of the banking system would have been fatal for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.97,0)">And it would also have been a problem for monetary policy and price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">After all, the banks transmit standard monetary policy to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">At that point, the ECB deployed one of the classic tools of central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">It stepped in as lender of last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It gave banks unlimited access to liquidity at longer terms and against a wider set of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">And it began to buy covered bonds, which were a prime source of funding for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">The ECB’s goal was to keep otherwise healthy banks alive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Stabilising the banks was crucial to safeguarding price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">However, as a lender of last resort, the ECB can only do one thing – provide liquidity to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.84,0)">It cannot and should not solve banks’ underlying problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.11,0)">In 2008, many banks were still bloated with bad debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.08,0)">Their problems went far beyond a mere shortage of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.82,0)">They were about to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">That was the moment when governments stepped in to save the banks and to prevent a systemic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.92,0)">This added to the pile of public debt that many governments had built up over the preceding years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.76,0)">And then the pile became too big for some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.44,0)">The stage had been set for the second phase of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.71,0)">In 2010, concerns started to grow in the markets that the Greek state might default on its debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.69,0)">The sovereign debt crisis had begun.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.73,0)">Similar fears spread to other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.05,0)">Portugal, Ireland, Spain and Italy faced rising borrowing costs, although the reasons for this were not always the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.73,0)">This added to doubts about their public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.89,0)">Once again, the banks were at risk; this time because they had many government bonds on their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">On top of that, government bonds are a key benchmark for borrowing costs in the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.94,0)">When markets arrive at a critical assessment of a country’s public debt, they put a risk premium on the private sector of that country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.64,0)">In this case, Greek companies were suddenly faced with much higher interest rates than otherwise identical German companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.92,0)">A financial market that had grown together over years broke apart; it became much more fragmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.28,0)">And that made it much more difficult to implement a single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">So once again the ECB had to step in to ensure that monetary policy remained effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It began to buy government bonds through its Securities Markets Programme, SMP for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">For a while the SMP helped to rein in uncontrolled surges in government bond yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">This ensured that monetary policy remained effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">However, in 2012 it became clear that more was needed as markets had gone one step further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">They had begun to price in a break-up of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.81,0)">The borrowing costs of governments surged, and the banks got into trouble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">In that situation, the ECB pledged to do “whatever it takes within its mandate” to preserve the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It announced that it would stand ready to buy government bonds of specific countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This programme was termed OMT, short for outright monetary transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.78,0)">It was subject to strict conditions, of course; I will spare you the details.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Right from the start, the OMT programme was described as a game changer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">It restored trust in the euro area and, as a result, there was actually no need to activate it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.37,0)">But the euro area was still caught in a recession, and growth slowed even further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.09,0)">The crisis had entered its third phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.63,0)">As the economy slowed down, inflation fell.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.12,0)">To revive it, the ECB cut interest rates twice in 2013, to a new low of 0.25%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.36,0)">But, in the following year, inflation declined further and even fell below 0% in December 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.91,0)">Among other things, this was due to a fall in oil prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It became clear that the ECB needed to do more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.33,0)">It had to prevent low inflation from becoming entrenched or even turning into deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.22,0)">But what could be done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.04,0)">With interest rates close to zero, the standard tools were only of limited use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The ECB’s Governing Council thus decided to take three non-standard measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">First, it broke through the zero lower bound of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In June 2014, the deposit rate was set to -0.10%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.44,0)">This gave banks an incentive to stop depositing their money at the ECB and pushed them to lend it to the real economy instead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.88,0)">At the same time, the ECB’s decision made clear to the markets that interest rates can fall below zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.58,0)">Markets adjusted their expectations about future interest rates, and this caused long-term interest rates to fall as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Second, the ECB provided longer-term refinancing to banks at very low rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The amount that banks can borrow is linked to their loans to private companies and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This should stimulate bank lending to the real economy, and make it easier for private companies and consumers to take out loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And third, the ECB used the tool of quantitative easing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Since March 2015, it has bought more than €2 trillion worth of public and private assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.68,0)">Among other things, this brings down long-term interest rates via various channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">At the same time, ECB made it clear that it is committed to its goal of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">The present – not quite there yet So these are the measures that were taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.55,0)">But where have they taken us?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.26,0)">I think everyone would agree that they have taken us into uncharted territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Some might say that they have taken us close to the limits of the ECB’s mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">And others might even argue that they have taken us past those limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.75,0)">At the same time, many people here in Germany argue that the ECB’s policy has many negative effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.7,0)">They feel that low interest rates penalise savers, hurt banks and destroy wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.51,0)">It is true, of course, that low interest rates have many effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Some of these are intentional – they make it cheaper to borrow money, spur investment, revive growth and, eventually, stimulate inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.06,0)">But they also have unintended side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.8,0)">So yes, for savers low interest rates do mean that their money accumulates at a much slower pace than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.02,0)">However, most people are not just savers – they also need to borrow money from time to time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And that’s when low interest rates benefit them; when they borrow money to buy a house, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.88,0)">The same applies to those who need a loan to set up a company.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.77,0)">It is a fact that monetary policy redistributes wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.29,0)">It always does, and there is no way around it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.71,0)">Low interest rates are good for borrowers and bad for savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.25,0)">It’s exactly the reverse with high interest rates: they’re bad for borrowers and good for savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.72,0)">But the ECB would not be fulfilling its mandate if these effects kept it from securing price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.6,0)">The ECB is responsible for price stability and price stability only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.18,0)">It is up to governments and parliaments to sort out redistribution policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Against that backdrop, the decision to lower interest rates was justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.06,0)">And, in any case, what would the alternative have been?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.13,0)">Savers might initially have been happy with higher interest rates, but the economy would have faltered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.86,0)">And over the medium to long term, savers would have felt that pain, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.72,0)">That said, there are other side effects of low interest rates that we must keep an eye on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.95,0)">Among other things, they set wrong incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.9,0)">This can lead to bubbles in the financial markets which eventually burst and hurt the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.2,0)">So while low interest rates are justified, they have side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.69,0)">And these side effects grow over time, while the intended effects of expansive monetary policy wear off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The same is true of the bond purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.49,0)">They took us even further into uncharted territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">While they do have a desired effect on financial markets, they also have side effects similar to those of low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.2,0)">And, over time, these side effects could even threaten financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">But we won’t be able to gauge the overall costs and benefits of our non-standard measures until many years have passed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As for today, we could continue discussing all these things for hours on end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">They are complex – and important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.18,0)">They directly affect the role of the central bank, its powers and its limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">However, there is another question I would like to consider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And this question is equally important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Did the measures work?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Did they help us achieve our goal – an inflation rate of close to, but below, 2%?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.54,0)">Well, obviously, inflation is still some way from our goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.83,0)">But does that mean the ECB’s policy has failed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.12,0)">No, of course not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.52,0)">Monetary policy never influences prices directly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.69,0)">The mechanism for transmitting a monetary policy impulse to the real economy, and driving a change in prices, involves many different steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.66,0)">The first step is that low interest rates, bond purchases and other tools influence conditions in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">They should make it easier for companies and people to borrow money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And that’s what we have seen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.57,0)">Since 2014, lending rates for non-financial corporations and households have fallen a lot – by 119 and 100 basis points, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.76,0)">And for small and medium-sized enterprises, they have even fallen further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">That is important because these companies provide most of the jobs in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">At the same time, lending rates in different countries have become less dispersed; the financial market has grown closer together again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">So far, the measures taken have had the desired effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The second step is that conditions in financial markets influence economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Companies can invest more, people can buy more goods and services, more jobs are created and the economy grows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">And we have seen that as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Growth has returned to the euro area, and so have jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.19,0)">We can look back on 17 quarters of economic growth and an unemployment rate that has fallen from around 12% to around 9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Confidence is growing and demand is increasing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">People in Europe have started spending again, and that supports the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">And the recovery is not confined to a few countries; it has taken hold across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The third and final step is that stronger economic growth influences prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.07,0)">As the economy comes closer to its full potential, production factors become scarcer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.94,0)">The supply of labour, for instance, begins to dry up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">This boosts wages, which prompts companies to raise prices – and inflation returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.31,0)">And it is here that we have got a bit stuck.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Inflation has picked up, but not as fast as we would have expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.5,0)">So what is holding it down?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Low oil and commodity prices are one factor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.23,0)">From January 2014 to January 2016, oil prices fell by about 70%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.4,0)">That is quite a drag on inflation, as you can imagine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And it acts as a brake not just on headline inflation, which includes energy prices, but also on underlying inflation, which excludes them, because energy is an input for so many other products and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.76,0)">But there are other factors which also weigh on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And the labour market is the place to look for them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">After all, wages play a key role in inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.58,0)">If wages go up, inflation goes up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">However, wages seem to be growing quite slowly even though the economy is recovering strongly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.21,0)">Why is that?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.71,0)">Well, one possibility is that the economy might be further from its full potential than we think.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.95,0)">In that case, the labour market would be less tight, wages would not rise, and that would hold down inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.89,0)">And indeed it seems that the headline unemployment rate doesn’t reflect some of the slack in the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.34,0)">Using broader measures of unemployment reveals that the labour market is less tight than the general unemployment rate suggests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.76,0)">A second factor is that inflation only tends to affect wages after a certain amount of time has passed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.91,0)">So the very low inflation from the past is still dampening wage growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This has offset some of the effects that stem from an improved labour market, and is another reason why wages are reacting more slowly than usual to economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.78,0)">And then there is the question of whether something more fundamental has changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.94,0)">Has inflation become less sensitive to changes in the real economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.39,0)">Has the Phillips curve become flatter?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">It seems that it did become flatter during the crisis in ways that make inflation slower to react to economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">However, it may well be that the curve steepens again once the economy reaches its full potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.28,0)">So what does all this mean?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.98,0)">The key message is that all the factors that are holding down inflation seem to be temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And this means two things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First – we need to be patient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Inflation will react to the economic recovery; it will just do so slowly due to various factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">But over the medium term, it will return to our goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.91,0)">It’s just a question of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">And we have the time, because we made the decision to define our goal with a view to the medium term: inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">And second – we need to maintain our expansive monetary policy to bring inflation back on a stable trend towards our goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But does that mean that monetary policies must continue as they are currently calibrated?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Do we still need to continue adding assets to our balance sheet, for example?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.27,0)">I don’t think so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.67,0)">I think we should begin reducing our bond purchases next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This should be done gradually, until we are no longer purchasing additional bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">I think it is time next year to gradually but completely roll back net purchases of bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For even if we allow our net purchases to come to an end, monetary policy will remain expansive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">For even if we phased out our net purchases of bonds entirely, some monetary accommodation would remain in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This is because we reinvest all the money from maturing bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">So the total volume of bonds would initially remain constant, as would the expansive effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">On top of that, our standard monetary policy measures would continue to have an effect as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And this takes me to the final part of my speech: the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The future – coming closer Looking to the future, we can be confident that inflation will return to our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Thus, we need to think about how we can bring our unconventional measures to an end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We need to look ahead and design the exit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">After all, it will be a major event for markets and the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And this links to another important issue: communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.35,0)">For a long time, central banks and monetary policy were very opaque.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.64,0)">In the 1980s, Alan Greenspan claimed that he had to learn “Fedspeak” when he became Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.62,0)">He “learned to mumble with great incoherence”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.11,0)">Back then central banks were secretive about monetary policy and vague, at best, when speaking to the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.73,0)">So markets had to find ways to second-guess what the central bank was up to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.5,0)">Some of these ways were a bit odd.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Alan Greenspan’s briefcase was one of the more inventive indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.04,0)">Whenever the Federal Reserve had a meeting to discuss monetary policy, the markets apparently observed Alan Greenspan’s briefcase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.58,0)">If it was bulging, markets concluded that interest rates would change; if it was thin, they concluded that no change was likely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.13,0)">In the end, such ways of gauging what the central bank is up to are quite unreliable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.44,0)">Markets might easily draw the wrong conclusions and this might lead to unwanted volatility and turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">That is one of the reasons why today, almost everyone agrees that central banks need to be transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">It helps them to steer the expectations of markets and make their policies more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">At the same time, it helps them be more accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Both of these things have become even more important against the backdrop of our unconventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">So we need to communicate very carefully on our next steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We must help markets get an idea of what the exit will look like.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.01,0)">And we mustn’t confuse them with vague or ambiguous ideas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">We have to strike a delicate balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">And in my view, we need to find this balance now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.81,0)">As of today, it is clear which sequence the exit will follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.15,0)">Bond purchases will come to an end, while interest rates will remain low, well past the horizon of net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.05,0)">The first step will be to cut the net purchases of bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Interest rates on the other hand will remain low, well past the horizon of our net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But we still need to decide on a timeframe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">From my point of view, it is important that we really move towards the exit – step by step, but steadily and in a clear direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, I began by saying that the days of “boring” central banking are over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">And I do hope that I have shown that to be true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">What is safe to say, though, is that central banks have stepped into the limelight and become a focal point of public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.44,0)">And it is a controversial debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Some argue that the ECB handled the crisis well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Others are much more critical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.31,0)">Who is right?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Today I have argued that, given the low inflation, monetary policy needed to be expansive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Admittedly, the appropriate degree of expansion and the necessary tools are moot points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.6,0)">In any case, we must bear in mind that some of the ECB’s more unconventional tools also have side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.25,0)">And these side effects will grow in magnitude the longer the tools are used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">So, the future holds the final answer to our question of whether monetary policy was optimally calibrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">If we manage to put the unconventional tools back into the box when the time comes, we will be able to claim that the ECB successfully achieved its objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And in my view, this time has come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We need to discuss how to exit from our unconventional monetary policy, and then we need to do it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.85,0)">My opinion is clear: we should begin to scale back our bond purchases at the beginning of next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.6,0)">When we bring our unconventional measures to an end, it will mark the last chapter of this turbulent tale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let’s hope that we can then go back to our quiet and boring former life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
