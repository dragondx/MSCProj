    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> The global importance of the euro Remarks by Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the ECBat the Frankfurt European Banking Congress 2006“Trade Center Europe”Frankfurt am Main, 17 November 2006 I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Introduction I would first like to thank the organisers for inviting me to this prestigious event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">It is both a privilege and a pleasure for me to participate in this year’s European Banking Congress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.53,0)">Let me start with two general remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">First, the international importance of the euro, and that of any other currency, can be measured and assessed on the basis of several criteria, notably: the role it plays in international trade and in global financial markets; the extent of its use by authorities as a reserve, intervention and anchor currency; and its possible use by the public or firms outside the euro area as a parallel currency, held for transaction purposes in the form of cash or bank deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The share of the euro in global official reserves is an important criterion or indicator for judging its international role, but it is not the only one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The second general point I would like to make concerns the position of the ECB with regard to the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As we have stressed in the past, the ECB considers the global use of the euro as a market-driven process that reflects all the factors influencing the preferences of global market participants and non-euro area authorities with regard to the functions it performs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.29,0)">So, we have a “neutral” view on the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Nevertheless, we carefully monitor and analyse pertinent developments in order to better understand the determinants of its global use and potential implications for the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The euro as reserve currency After these preliminary remarks, let me focus on the importance of the euro in the global official reserves held by central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The share of the euro in global official foreign exchange reserves increased during the first few years following its introduction, but has remained relatively unchanged in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Specifically, the share of the euro rose from 18% in 1999 to 25% in 2003 and has been relatively stable since then, reaching 25.4% at the end of June 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There are four pertinent remarks that I would like to make concerning these figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">First, the current share of the euro in global official reserves as calculated from the IMF statistics is higher than the share of the sum of all legacy currencies of the euro – notably that of the Deutsche Mark – in global official reserves at the end of 1998 before the euro was launched, which was about 18%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.71,0)">Second, the pertinent IMF statistics cover only about two-thirds of global foreign exchange reserves, because a number of countries with large holdings of reserves – mostly from Asia – do not fully participate in the IMF’s survey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.37,0)">All countries, of course, provide figures for the total value of their reserves, but not all countries report their composition by currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Third, it is interesting to note that the share of the euro in the total reserves held by those emerging market economies that do provide the relevant statistics rose from around 19% in 1999 to almost 30% at the end of June 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Finally, it is worth keeping in mind that the reported shares are influenced by valuation effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Expressed in constant exchange rates  , the increase in the share of the euro is somewhat less pronounced  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.3,0)">What are the main determinants of the currency composition of foreign exchange reserves?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And how can we explain the observed gradual evolution of the share of different currencies in total official reserves?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">When discussing these questions, we need to distinguish, of course, between stocks and flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.6,0)">Changes in the currency composition of the existing stock of foreign exchange reserves therefore might not only reflect a possible reallocation of part of the existing reserves held or the valuation effects that I mentioned before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.13,0)">They could also be due to changes in the currency composition of the flows of additional reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.57,0)">However, the latter – that is, the flow of additional reserves accumulated every year – is relatively small, at about 500 billion US dollars per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The outstanding stock of global reserves, by comparison, amounts to about 4.6 trillion US dollars  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">If we exclude large valuation effects, the effects of changes in the currency composition of the flows of reserves on the stock are likely to be relatively small and gradual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">A further important aspect in this discussion is that central banks’ decisions on the currency composition of the stock of their reserves are mainly based on a number of criteria that are different than those that guide the decisions of private investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">For example, central banks of emerging market economies allocate their reserves only partly with a view to optimising the returns of their portfolio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Their decisions mainly reflect other considerations, such as the choice of a currency as a nominal anchor for the conduct of monetary policy, the currency composition of external debt or trade invoicing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In this context, allow me to draw your attention to the fact that some 25 countries use the euro as a reference currency for their exchange rate polices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.89,0)">As those factors relate to long-term policy choices or economic developments, they can be expected to result in strong inertia in the allocation and management of reserves by central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">There are, however, exceptions: for example, the authorities in Russia announced in December 2005 that they had increased the share of the euro in foreign exchange reserves to 40%  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">To some extent, this decision may have been linked to a more prominent role of the euro in the Bank of Russia’s currency basket for the management of exchange rate volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.85,0)">At the same time, in some countries, notably oil- or other commodity-exporting countries, an increasing proportion of the “official” foreign currency assets is held outside central banks by public investment agencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">These agencies may invest in a wide spectrum of assets denominated in various currencies, with the aim of maximising the expected return on their holdings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Prospects for the further development of the international role of the euro Given these observations, what can be expected with regard to the relative importance of the euro in global official reserves in the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.9,0)">As is well-known, prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And you will understand that I will not speculate on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">That said, I will explore, more generally, the prospects for the further development of the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">On this point, allow me to make a general pertinent remark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Clearly, a necessary condition for fostering the international role of a currency is its credibility, as determined by the stability of its internal value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">The ECB, by preserving price stability in the euro area, “sets the stage” and establishes a necessary condition for the wider international use of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">But whether or not the international importance of the euro will further increase depends on many other factors as well, in particular the investment decisions of private agents and public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Traditionally, a key determinant of the international use of a currency – especially as a means of exchange – has been trade, the very theme of this year’s European Banking Congress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">From the drachma in the kingdoms of the Hellenistic period, to the guilder during the heyday of the Dutch trading empire, to sterling in the 19th century and the dollar over the past half century until today, trade and international currency use went hand in hand: the larger the importance of a country or currency area in world trade, the greater the international importance of its currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Given Europe’s role as the world’s largest trader, it is not surprising that the share of the euro in the invoicing and settlement of the euro area’s trade with the rest of the world has increased significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The latest numbers collected by the Eurosystem show that most euro area countries conduct more than half of their trade with partners outside the euro area in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.31,0)">What is more striking is that trade taking place entirely outside the euro area – for instance, between EU countries that have not yet adopted the euro as well as between countries seeking to accede to the EU – is also being invoiced and settled in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">As these developments cannot be fully explained by increasing trade linkages of these countries with the euro area, it would appear that the euro has started to become a vehicle currency in international trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">That said, recent ECB research on this issue has also shown that the euro does not display one of the characteristics typically associated with vehicle currencies – namely their use in the trade of commodities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">An international currency is not only used for trade purposes, but also for financing and investment purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">And also in this respect, we observe wider use of the euro in international financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">For example, over the past seven years, the share of the euro in the stock of international debt securities gradually rose from 19% to slightly below 32%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Other market segments – for example the spot foreign exchange market – are characterised by a high degree of stability, possibly reflecting the importance of network externalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">However, market data   show that the euro is the second most widely used currency, accounting on average for almost 22% of all daily transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The increase in the use of the euro as a financing currency in international bond markets, has been a key feature of its international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A geographical breakdown of the outstanding stock of international debt securities issued in euro shows that European entities   in the vicinity of the euro area account for the largest share of such issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.84,0)">What are the factors that influence the choice of currency by firms when issuing bonds?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Research undertaken at the ECB   suggests that these decisions are influenced by both strategic and cost-related considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.85,0)">The firm size and the investor base in the euro area affect a firm’s decision in which currency to issue a bond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And a firm’s exposure to the euro area also has a bearing on the currency choice for bond issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Thus, the increased use of the euro as a currency for bond issuance reflects firms’ attempts to hedge their exposure to the euro area and to broaden their investor base by tapping euro area financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.34,0)">This finding brings me to my last remark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Whether or not private agents use the euro as their currency of choice when seeking finance or investment opportunities depends on the availability of large, integrated and liquid financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">While – as I said in the beginning – the ECB neither encourages nor hinders the international use of the euro, we do promote financial integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">We know from economic theory that more integrated and efficient financial markets can help raise productivity, foster innovation and thus enhance economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">But now we also have strong empirical evidence, based on ECB research analysing the available evidence for many countries and sectors, that the size and depth of capital markets have a significant positive impact on economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">For Europe, therefore, the creation of larger and more liquid financial markets is, and should be, a desirable end in itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">At the same time, more developed and efficient financial markets in the euro area will increase the attractiveness of our currency for international investors, and thus enhance the euro’s global role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Concluding remarks In market economies, people are free to choose among alternatives in line with their preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The fact that many economic agents – be they private individuals, investors, savers, traders or public authorities – outside the euro area increasingly choose the euro as their preferred currency testifies to the trust which they place in its stability and credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is a sign of distinction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">At the same time, it also serves as a constant reminder of the importance to preserve this confidence, by maintaining the euro’s internal purchasing power, by enhancing the growth potential of our economy, and by further integrating and deepening Europe’s financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">If we include the countries of the CFA Franc Zone in Western Africa, this number rises to 40 countries which the IMF classifies as having exchange rate regimes that either use the euro as sole reference currency or as part of a currency basket.</span>
