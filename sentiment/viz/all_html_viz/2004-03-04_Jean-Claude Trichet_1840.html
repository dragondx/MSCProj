    <span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)"> Paris seminar on the EU accession process: Dinner address by Jean-Claude Trichet,President of the European Central Bank,Paris, 4 March 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Colleagues, fellow central bankers, ladies and gentlemen, I speak to you on the eve of an inspiring moment in the history of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In less than two months from now, the European Union will complete its largest ever expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">What was originally a Community of six countries in western Europe will become a Union of 25 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.46,0)">A Union of some 450 million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">This enlargement will be the EU's greatest: not just in terms of size, but also because of its historical significance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.98,0)">Tomorrow it will be 58 years to the day that Winston Churchill gave a speech in Fulton, Missouri, in which he spoke of an iron curtain descending across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Today, not only has that curtain been torn down; the edifice that had been painstakingly built on one side is being expanded to house those who once lived on the other side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The members of the East will finally join the members of the West as members of the same European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As European central bankers, our destiny is intertwined with the destiny of our continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">As Europe is being rebuilt and reunited, so we are reinforcing and uniting its monetary foundations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We have already created a single European currency and a European System of Central Banks  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">And with it we are providing the monetary stability that eluded Europe for much of the last century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">But we still face the task of eventually fully integrating new Member States into our common monetary area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.85,0)">This is indeed a challenging task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.96,0)">Challenging because we must ensure that the process runs smoothly, without jeopardising the monetary stability that is our ultimate duty to European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.48,0)">Challenging, also, because of the logistics involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Enlargement of the euro area is, first and foremost, a challenge for the new Member States seeking to join.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">If I may address directly those of us who come from the acceding countries, I would say that you face the challenge of preparing your economies for life in Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">In this respect, let us not forget that a great deal has already been achieved, especially in those countries that have had to undertake a transition from planned to market-based economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The fact that this major round of EU enlargement is taking place in less than two months' time bears witness to your achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">You have fulfilled the "Copenhagen criteria".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">You have stable democracies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">You have functioning market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">You have adopted the acquis communautaire.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.16,0)">But this is no time to rest on one's laurels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Having travelled the road set out in "Copenhagen", it is time to drive on; time to travel along the road mapped out in "Maastricht".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Along this road the watchword will be stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For central banks, this means maintaining price stability and preserving financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">For governments, it means pursuing stability-oriented economic policies and, in particular, sound fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Overall, these efforts should lead to a high degree of sustainable convergence, characterised by the fulfilment of the Maastricht convergence criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">At the same time, these efforts must be made in the context of a parallel process of real convergence of economic structures and income levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We all know that this will be no easy task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The road to the euro will be long and demanding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">But at least it is a road that has been travelled along before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">And you can benefit from the experience of those who have already travelled along it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">We, the Eurosystem, can also help this process by making sure that the right signposts are there along the way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As you know, last December, we published the policy position of the Governing Council on exchange rate issues relating to the acceding countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In this document we have set out what are, in our view, the principles which should guide participation in ERM II and the adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I do not need to summarise this document during this dinner as it will no doubt be touched upon tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Let me just say that it is a product of ongoing efforts by the Governing Council to steer the process of monetary integration in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Guiding this process is, of course, not all we must do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">For our part, we must also make sure that everything is ready and in place for you when you arrive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.76,0)">This has been, and will continue to be, a challenge for the ECB and the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">To be ready: first for enlargement of the EU and later for enlargement of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The operational framework, the IT infrastructure, TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I could go on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It all needs to be ready in time for you to "move in".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Let me assure you that we do not underestimate the scale of this task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">And let me also reassure you that we have a good track record in meeting such logistical challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Prior to the introduction of the euro, the European Monetary Institute, the ECB's predecessor, established a Master Plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">A plan setting out the regulatory, organisational and logistical preparations necessary for the ESCB to perform its tasks in Stage Three of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Inspired by this, last year we devised a new Master Plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">An Accession Master Plan to guide all activities necessary for the enlargement of the ESCB and later the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Things are well on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Indeed they have been for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">For years now cooperation between the central banks of the Eurosystem and the central banks of the accession countries has been intense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">There have been regular meetings, visits and exchanges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">These have covered the policy and technical aspects of all central banking activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I am told that there have been more than 1,000 such "central bank cooperation activities" in the last four years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Since the outset, the Eurosystem has been very committed to supporting the enlargement process and to ensuring its success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This is why we decided back in 1999 to organise a seminar bringing together the governors and senior officials of the ESCB and the central banks of accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">And we have met on an annual basis since then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Over the years, these seminars have proved to be a very useful forum for policy dialogue on the monetary, exchange rate and financial aspects of enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">They have also helped the ECB and the Eurosystem to develop and present their views and so, as I mentioned earlier, to steer the process in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">After Helsinki, Vienna, Berlin and Genval, it is a great honour for me to welcome you to our fifth seminar on the accession process here in Paris.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And this time it is also a particular pleasure because it will be the last of these seminars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.13,0)">When I say this, it is not because I don't enjoy these seminars or sharing your company in such wonderful cities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.38,0)">And it is not because I have lost interest in the accession process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.11,0)">Certainly not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">It is because for 10 of the 12 accession countries the process of EU accession is now effectively complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">From 1 May this year, the ten central banks of the acceding countries will become part of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.34,0)">Part of the same monetary team.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Since May last year, the governors of the acceding country central banks have already participated, as observers, in meetings of the General Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The relevant experts from acceding countries have participated in meetings of ESCB committees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">You are already effectively part of our team.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">And let us hope that those of you from the remaining accession countries will also be joining our team in the not too distant future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Fellow members and future members of our team, ladies and gentlemen, on the eve of this historic moment in European history, I raise my glass to you, and look forward to our seminar on the EU accession process.</span>
