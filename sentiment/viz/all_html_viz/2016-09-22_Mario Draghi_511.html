    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)"> Welcome address Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB and Chair of the European Systemic Risk Board,at the first annual conference of the ESRB,Frankfurt am Main, 22 September 2016 Ladies and gentlemen, It is my pleasure to welcome you to the first annual conference of the European Systemic Risk Board  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">We have a rich agenda today and tomorrow – one which reflects the value of the ESRB as an institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The Board brings policymakers together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We have 80 member institutions, each expert in their own field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">This diversity of expertise is our strength.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The ESRB is uniquely placed to take a holistic view of the European financial system – to see the overarching risks and challenges that would be more difficult for our members to perceive individually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Sharing knowledge and expertise also permits effective coordination of policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The ESRB acts as an information hub for the implementation of macroprudential policies for banks, and as a forum to discuss these policies, including their cross-border impact and the possible need to reciprocate them in other jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Given its unique Union-wide, cross-sectoral perspective, the ESRB has focused its research on the challenges posed by the structure of the European financial system, and the risks and opportunities arising from ongoing changes to that structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In that context, let me highlight two themes: the extent of overbanking in Europe and the growth of the non-bank sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Overbanking in Europe Two years ago, the ESRB’s Advisory Scientific Committee   published a widely cited report entitled “Is Europe overbanked?”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">It pointed out that, over the preceding two decades, the banking sector had outgrown capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.99,0)">In the late 1990s, the ratio of total bank assets to equity and private bond market capitalisation in Europe was below two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">By 2008, this ratio had risen to four.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.7,0)">By contrast, the comparable ratio in the US remained below one over this period, and that of Japan remained below two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Banks play a vital role in financing small and medium sized enterprises, which are a key part of the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This lending must continue to flow to productive projects if Europe is to prosper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.75,0)">But bank lending has a tendency to be procyclical: growing too quickly when the economy expands, and shrinking sharply when it contracts .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.08,0)">As a result, in the aftermath of a financial crisis economic growth in countries with bank-based systems lags behind that of countries with more balanced financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The clear policy message is that it is better to finance the real economy through several channels rather than to rely on just one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Capital markets in particular can act as a useful “spare tyre”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">That is why the ESRB fully supports the capital markets union, which aims to remove barriers to the development of capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Removing these barriers will foster changes in the structure of the financial system in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">In fact, capital markets and other non-bank sources of external finance have been growing relative to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">This growth should improve firms’ access to funding, and ensure that any losses are dispersed more widely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.28,0)">Low bank profitability The overbanking in Europe, highlighted in the ASC’s report, is also a factor in the currently low level of bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.36,0)">A number of reasons have been mooted as the causes of this low profitability, including low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.83,0)">Long-term real interest rates have been falling in the major advanced economies for two decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.44,0)">Technological change, demographics, income inequality and safe asset scarcity are just a few of the factors exerting downward pressure on long-term real rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.19,0)">Accommodative monetary policy by the European Central Bank and other major central banks, acting in accordance with their price stability mandates, has also contributed to low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.08,0)">Low interest rates tend to squeeze net interest margins owing to downward rigidity in banks’ deposit rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.44,0)">But overbanking is also a factor in the current low level of bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.14,0)">Over-capacity in some national banking sectors, and the ensuing intensity of competition, exacerbates this squeeze on margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.29,0)">Such over-capacity also means the sector does not operate at the efficient frontier, which is one reason why cost-to-income ratios remain high in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">At the same time, banks benefit from revaluations in their fixed income portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Moreover, profitability is boosted by a greater flow of lending and lower loan loss provisions than would have occurred in the absence of accommodative monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.88,0)">Analysis by the ECB suggests that these effects tend to outweigh the impact on net interest income over the short term, but the picture varies depending on banks’ business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">In the broader context of generalised over-capacity and technological innovation, some banks will need to review their business models to bolster profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.38,0)">Other financial institutions also face challenges to their business models in this environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.78,0)">In particular, institutions providing longer-term return guarantees – notably guaranteed-return life insurers – face a future of weak profitability unless they adapt their business models to a changing world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Macroprudential policy can help to boost the collective resilience of these institutions and enhance recovery and resolution frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Systemic risks beyond banking Let me now turn to the ESRB’s focus on systemic risks beyond banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">As financial intermediation continues to shift from banks to non-banks, we need to adapt our policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">We need to identify migrating risks and develop tools to mitigate them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">With this in mind, the ESRB published its first annual EU Shadow Banking Monitor in July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.4,0)">The report identifies a number of areas that require close monitoring, including rising liquidity mismatches, especially among some bond funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.53,0)">One measure of liquidity mismatch for open-ended funds is the share of non-liquid assets in total assets, which was 38% for bond funds in the fourth quarter of 2015, compared with 26% six years earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.12,0)">In this context, the ESRB is further analysing systemic risks posed by liquidity mismatch and leverage in investment funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Moreover, the report identifies considerable interconnectedness between banks and shadow banks, particularly money market funds  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Approximately two-thirds of MMFs’ total assets are related to banks, mainly in the form of debt securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">This interconnectedness was a key consideration underpinning the ESRB’s recommendation that MMFs should have a fluctuating net asset value, rather than promising a constant one, and that they should be subject to enhanced disclosure and liquidity requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Macroprudential policy beyond banking More generally, the ESRB is analysing connections across different sectors and geographies of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This cross-cutting analysis informs the development and calibration of macroprudential policy beyond banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In this way, targeted research enhances the quality of policymaking and thereby improves the resilience of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The ESRB believes that the smooth functioning and systemic resilience of derivatives markets can be improved by requiring standardised over-the-counter contracts to be centrally cleared and traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms, in line with the commitments made by the G20 in 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The EU’s first central clearing obligation came into effect in June this year for certain interest rate derivatives, and will gradually be extended to other transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.82,0)">The ESRB is monitoring the effects of this obligation on collateral demand and network structure, and will publish its findings in due course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The ESRB is also leading research into new macroprudential instruments beyond banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">One policy under consideration is the macroprudential use of margin and haircut requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Setting margins and haircuts in a conservative or countercyclical manner may help to contain the excessive build-up of leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In addition to “leaning against the wind”, margin and haircut requirements can also improve financial stability by mitigating illiquidity spirals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.95,0)">This is particularly important given that an imbalance between the demand for and supply of liquidity could amplify or transmit shocks through the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Since the ESRB’s foundation, Europe has strengthened its regulatory, supervisory, and crisis management frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">The ESRB has contributed to building a rich set of macroprudential policy tools for banks,  and continues to coordinate the calibration of those policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The European financial system has thus become more resilient, with greater loss-absorbing capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The financial system is also adaptive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Its adaptability is a strength, helping it to meet the challenges of the current environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But it also means that policymakers must remain vigilant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The need for vigilance is why the ESRB has always warned against policy inaction bias.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.57,0)">Macroprudential policy is still in its formative years, and policymakers are understandably cautious about deploying novel instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">But when we see systemic risks, we should act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.11,0)">Greater risk arises from inaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">So as you listen to the presentations at this conference, think about the implications for macroprudential policy in a changing world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Is the macroprudential policy stance appropriate?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Are the tools at our disposal effective?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Your thoughts and comments will reflect the unique value-added of the ESRB: to bring policymakers together to exchange expertise and coordinate policy action, with the common aim of reducing the risk of financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">On that note, I am pleased to open this first annual conference of the European Systemic Risk
