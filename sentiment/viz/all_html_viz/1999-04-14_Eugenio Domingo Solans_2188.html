    <span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)"> 100 days of EMU: First experiences and further perspectives Eugenio Domingo Solans Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank Speech delivered at the Hochschule für Bankwirtschaft/HfB Frankfurt am Main, 14 April 1999 INTRODUCTION Allow me to begin by going back two and a half years, to 4 October 1996 to be exact, when I had the opportunity to address the members of the Hochschule für Bankwirtschaft at the diploma ceremony for graduates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">On that occasion, I referred to the process of European Monetary Union and to Spain's position on this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I should like to recall one paragraph of my speech: "Is it really a question of choosing between the number of countries joining the future European Monetary Union or its stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Quite honestly, I do not think so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I do not mind admitting that if there were a dilemma about this, I should be in favour of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">I think it would be better to construct the European Union more slowly and give priority to economic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">But given the efforts the main European countries are making to converge, I am sure that a significant number of them will meet the convergence criteria and be able to join Monetary Union with full guarantees of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">I am also sure that Spain will be one of them."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.88,0)">I still remember the smiles of most of those attending when I pronounced these last words, clearly reflecting scepticism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I was convinced that the single currency, which was later named the euro, would be introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">I was also convinced that Spain would be present among the countries joining this project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I could even accept back then the idea of a Spaniard as member of the Executive Board of the future European Central Bank  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But what I could not predict, because my optimism has its limits, was that this Spaniard would be me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">The fact is that here I am now, pleased to be a citizen of Frankfurt, and to have the opportunity of visiting the Hochschule again, this important centre of Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Thank you very much for inviting me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.25,0)">Although we conventionally consider 100 days to be the minimum period of time necessary to form an opinion on something or somebody, we would all agree that this period is nothing in the lifetime of a currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The Deutsche Mark has lasted fifty years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Several years went by before it could gain its reputation of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Something similar could be the case for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Nevertheless, if not a sound judgement, it is always possible to convey some first impressions after the first 100 days of the life of a new currency, and after almost one year of the life of the institution responsible for its regulation: the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In this first appraisal of the euro and the ECB, I shall mainly refer to the functional aspects related to monetary policy, after which I shall say a few words about other ESCB functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I shall end my contribution with comments on some of the further perspectives of the euro and the ESCB, especially regarding institutional issues, as indicated in the second part of the title of my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">100 DAYS OF MONETARY POLICY The monetary policy of the European System of Central Banks   formulated by the ECB and implemented by the national central banks   is, without a doubt, a big success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.12,0)">Speaking of monetary policy means speaking of three different elements, which together form the basic machinery, the correct functioning of which is the main responsibility of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.68,0)">These three elements are the following: the objectives, the strategy and the instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">Let us consider them separately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The objectives The objectives of the ECB were established in the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">According to Article 105 of the Treaty, "the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Thus, stability is the main goal of the Eurosystem and it is, therefore, the main touchstone to assess its success or failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The success of the euro and the Eurosystem should first and foremost be measured in terms of its stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Stability is the basic requirement of a good currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">And the euro enjoys stability, as proven by the latest inflation data for the euro area, corresponding to the month of February 1999, which - measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   - reflected an annual increase of 0.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">The success of the euro cannot, however, be measured by the evolution of its exchange rate in relation to other currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.97,0)">The fact that since 1 January 1999 the effective nominal exchange rate of the euro has depreciated is of much less relevance than the sound inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In the long run the strength of a currency and its stability move together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.17,0)">We say that in order to measure the success of the euro the level of inflation is of relevance and not the exchange rate, mainly because inflation depends basically - but not exclusively - on the action of the Eurosystem, while the exchange rate of the euro depends on the macroeconomic fundamentals of the euro area, the evolution of other currencies and market expectations, against which it is preferable not to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.02,0)">We would have to ask ourselves to what extent the evolution of the euro reflects the strength of the dollar rather than the weakness of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.0,0)">And, finally, we Europeans must be conscious of the fact that, with the parities of 10 of our currencies irrevocably fixed, the external exchange rate for our respective economies is now of less importance than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Regarding the objective of price stability, let me remind you that reaching price stability is the main responsibility of the ECB, but it cannot be achieved by the ECB alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Stability concerns the whole society, and this is precisely why we speak of a "stability culture".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Governments in particular are, of course, also involved in the achievement of stability by applying an appropriate economic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Complying with the Stability and Growth Pact or implementing structural reforms in the markets to foster competition are key elements in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The remaining task in connection with the primary objective of the ESCB was undertaken by the ECB last autumn and consisted in providing a quantitative definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">This definition, in the exact terms approved by the Governing Council of the ECB, reads as follows: "Price stability shall be defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">And the Governing Council added that price stability will be "maintained over the medium term".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I should like to make some comments regarding this definition of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">First of all, I should like to underline that this is a definition and, therefore, it is a lasting commitment, and not simply an objective for a limited period of time to be revised on an annual basis, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.17,0)">Second, you should note that we use the term "increase" and not "variation", meaning that a decrease in the HICP   is not consistent with the idea of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Third, we specify the index to be used to measure inflation, the HICP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Although we should always be open to future improvements, let me state that this index, prepared by Eurostat, is good enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.42,0)">It takes into account very hi-tech items such as computers, and it is a "price index" and not a "cost of living index".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.22,0)">This explains the fact that it does not fully cover owner-occupied housing costs, for example, it excludes imputed rents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.42,0)">Fourth, what the ECB must really consider is the euro area-wide trend of inflation and not the specific figures for each country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Fifth, we understand that it is appropriate to allow a range of stability and not a single figure, in order to give room for some possible measurement bias in the HICP   and also, in my opinion, to introduce the idea of intensity of stability, which I shall explain later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Sixth, it must be stressed that stability has to be understood in a medium-term perspective, disregarding short-term volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.26,0)">And, finally, why precisely below 2%?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.66,0)">This limit is, of course, a convention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It could be 2.5% instead, just the same as the speed limit could be 90 kmph instead of 80 kmph.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">But, on the other hand, stability cannot be defined as an increase in prices of, say, up to 4%, just as 160 kmph is not a real speed limit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The substance underlying the 2% limit is that the price increase should take measurement bias into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This limit should be low enough to avoid significant distortions in price setting and to make any general indexation process unnecessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Following our example, the limit must take into account the lack of precision of the car's speedometer and discourage reckless driving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">To sum up, the ECB has completed an important task defining in very precise terms the concept of stability, which is its main responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Besides stability, which is the primary objective of the ESCB, the Maastricht Treaty refers to a secondary objective in Article 105: "Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, the ESCB shall support the general economic policies in the Community, with a view to contributing to the achievement of objectives of the Community as laid down in Article 2".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Among other things, Article 2 refers to "sustainable and non-inflationary growth respecting the environment" and to a "high level of employment and of social protection".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Although, without a doubt, the outstanding objective of the ESCB, its real "raison d'être", is to pursue stability, this secondary objective implies that the ECB, when taking decisions on monetary policy, has responsibilities in the field of economic growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.99,0)">General, indirect and conditional responsibilities, but responsibilities nevertheless.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.83,0)">Let me add that denying these responsibilities does not enhance the ESCB's commitment to stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.22,0)">On the contrary, fundamentalism is not the best approach when trying to convince others of an idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In order to be convincing I rather prefer to use rational arguments, which imply, among other things, an awareness of the global picture surrounding an idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.81,0)">Let me also add that we must be aware that the main risk for the present consensus on the "culture of stability" stems, precisely, from the unacceptably high level of unemployment in our countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">My personal understanding of this secondary objective of the ESCB is that, in the long run, the best contribution that the ECB can make in favour of sustainable growth and of a high level of employment is, precisely, providing an atmosphere of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Stability implies efficient allocation of resources, competitiveness, lower interest rate risk premiums, investment, job creation and protection of the value of incomes, savings and wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">All these factors are preconditions for economic growth, a high level of employment and social protection or, in other words, preconditions for the fulfilment of the secondary objective of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In securing its objective of stability, the Eurosystem creates the conditions for complying with the other objectives of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Does this mean that the motto of the ECB should be "only stability matters" or "the greater stability, the better"?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.35,0)">Of course not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.44,0)">We should recognise that, in the short run, there could be a trade-off between the degree of stability and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me stress that I am speaking of a trade-off between the degree of stability and growth, and not between stability itself and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.48,0)">To put it in a more technical way, monetary policy affects both prices and quantities in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Intensity of stability matters in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In terms of economic growth, a degree of stability of, for example, a 0.5% increase in the HICP would not mean the same as a degree of stability of, for example, 1.5% increase of HICP, especially if a significantly tighter monetary policy is required to achieve the former.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.68,0)">The required degree of monetary policy tightness will depend, among other factors, on the economic cycle and on exogenous variables such as commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In the short run, assuming an inflationary scenario, the pace or rhythm of movement towards stability can also have effects in terms of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.03,0)">The right moment to make decisions, the timing, also matters: it must be neither too early nor too late, so as not to affect growth expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.72,0)">To summarise, in the short run, "stability: the deeper, the faster, the sooner, the better" is not always the best guidance for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.81,0)">Actually, hitting the mark is more than a technique, it is a real art form: the so-called "art of central banking".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The strategy Another very important decision of the ECB was the choice of monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Strategy is the guidance which makes good decisions possible and which is, therefore, a vital element of the internal decision-making process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Moreover, a well-defined strategy explains the reasons for taking a certain decision, and thus enables the markets and the public to understand, interpret and judge correctly the central bank's performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">You should bear in mind that the way in which a measure is interpreted is as important for monetary policy as, so to speak, the "mechanical" effect of the measure itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.17,0)">A misinterpreted measure can reverse the impact it was intended to have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">A correct strategy promotes credibility and confidence and therefore enhances the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Last but not least, the strategy of monetary policy, as well as a precise definition of its primary objective, is closely linked to the idea of accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The European Monetary Institute   and later the ECB were confronted with three possible, let us say, "pure models" of monetary policy strategy: the exchange rate strategy, the intermediate monetary targeting strategy and the direct inflation targeting strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.7,0)">The first one   was discarded by the EMI from the very beginning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">It can be useful in the case of a small open economy, which has close economic links to a major one with a high degree of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.35,0)">In that specific case, pegging the exchange rate to the stable currency is a way to "import" stability and avoid any disturbance in the economic exchanges between the two countries, but it implies giving up monetary policy autonomy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Needless to say this is not the case for the euro area given its size or for the euro vis-à-vis any other currency in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Regarding this point, let me make some more general comments about the possibility of co-ordinating or limiting the fluctuations of the euro exchange rate in relation to other currencies outside the ESCB, in particular the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.69,0)">Having regard to the desirability of reducing, as far as possible, the relative volatility of the dollar and the euro, it should nevertheless be affirmed that the establishment, officially or unofficially, implicitly or explicitly, of certain fluctuation bands between the exchange rates of the dollar and of the euro would represent an error of economic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.42,0)">This idea is therefore dismissed by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">It is important to emphasise in this connection the impossibility of simultaneously achieving two independent objectives - price stability and exchange rate stability - with the single instrumentation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The only specific case in which this possibility occurs is, indeed, pegging the exchange rate to a stable currency as a way to secure stability in line with an exchange rate strategy for monetary policy, as I have already said.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.18,0)">Otherwise, if there were a set fluctuation bands for the euro exchange rate, the said exchange rate objective could come into conflict with price stability and the ECB would not be fulfilling its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.67,0)">Simultaneously having pegged exchange rates, free movement of capital and monetary autonomy is simply impossible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is precisely the reason why the countries of the Eurosystem have transferred their monetary autonomy to the ECB, which acts as a single monetary authority within an economic area whose exchange rates are completely fixed   and with free movement of capital  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And exactly the same argument explains why two different monetary authorities, each with its own decision-making autonomy   in an environment of free movement of capital, cannot hope to peg or even to co-ordinate the exchange rates of their respective currencies successfully in the face of deep-rooted divergent trends in the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Instead of establishing exchange rate fluctuation bands, European experience has shown that certain good common macroeconomic fundamentals represent the best strategy for achieving a better co-ordination of exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let us go back to the ECB's monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Discarding the exchange rate strategy for the reasons explained above, the ECB selected a monetary policy strategy of its own which contains elements of pure intermediate monetary targeting and pure direct inflation targeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">By doing so, the ECB avoided any kind of polarisation between these two strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.22,0)">They are, certainly, different, but not opposite nor contradictory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">They complement each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">And indeed, it is possible to take elements from one or the other and build a new and authentic strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">As you probably know, the ECB's own strategy, which in my opinion deserves a better label than the descriptive "stability-oriented monetary policy strategy", comprises two pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">First, a quantitative reference value for the growth rate of M3 of 4½%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This percentage derives - in the context of a medium-term framework - from Fisher's quantity equation, using the definition of stability and realistic hypothesis of the trend growth of GDP   and the trend decline in velocity of money  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The second pillar of our monetary policy strategy consists of a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments and risks to stability obtained from a wide range of economic indicators  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Notice that the link between the secondary objective of the ESCB and its strategy occurs in this second pillar, where growth prospects are an important indicator of price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Why a new strategy with two pillars?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Because we are dealing with a new currency regulated by a new institution in a new economic area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.74,0)">The term "new" conveys the idea of "uncertainty" to the prudent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The best way to clear up uncertainties is to rely as much as possible not on one or the other, but on all successful past experiences of the NCBs, and not to make only one strong bet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Thus, the ECB's monetary policy strategy takes or combines elements of the two strategies used by most NCBs of the euro area, which is not the same as combining the two strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.68,0)">Instead of a monetary target, the ECB prefers to have a monetary reference value, because, for the time being, the ECB cannot afford to miss a target, as the Deutsche Bundesbank did, without losing credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.33,0)">No one should expect a systematic and mechanical reaction of the ECB when deviations from the reference value occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.31,0)">Moreover, the ECB does not publish inflation forecasts, nor does it set an annual inflation objective, as the Bank of England does now and the Banco de España did in the past, although it has a precise definition of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The touchstone of a good monetary policy strategy is how clear and predictable the so-called reaction function of monetary policy is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In my opinion, the ECB's monetary policy strategy makes it possible to understand decisions, whether "passive ones"   or "active ones"  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The expectations and reactions surrounding the 8 April interest rate move are a good example of this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.34,0)">The ECB's monetary policy strategy has been accused of opacity, of a lack of transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.79,0)">I do not think this is true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I think rather that one must not confuse opacity with discretion, transparency with automatism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I can accept that there is no automatism in the ECB's strategy, in the sense that monetary policy decisions do not feed back from a change in specific variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In the dilemma between rules and discretion, I admit that the ECB is closer to discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">After all, who really believes in rules robust enough to eliminate the need for discretion in monetary policy decisions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.37,0)">Who really thinks that the Friedman rule or the Taylor rule is more than a meritorious academic contribution to monetary policy theory, useful only as background material?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Who genuinely believes that these and other similar rules can be used as a real guide to take monetary policy decisions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.43,0)">Instruments No central bank has compiled in its manual of procedures such a wide range of monetary policy instruments as those listed in the so-called "General Documentation" of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There is no special merit to this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Open market operations of various types, with several maturities and frequencies and for different purposes, are easy to specify, taking advantage of the rich experience of our NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">At the same time, establishing standing facilities or a remunerated minimum reserve is within the reach of any central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">All these instruments with their different varieties and procedures have their pros and cons, advantages and drawbacks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The merit lies in being able to assess these pros and cons in a proper manner and in choosing the best instrument and procedure for each situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The merit also lies in changing the instruments and procedures whenever necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The ECB has done so and is prepared to do so in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In the first days of single monetary policy, there was little doubt of the advantages of a fixed rate tender with a certain percentage of allotment for the weekly main refinancing operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It makes it possible to control both price and quantities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It avoids giving wrong signals to the market and liquidity can be kept under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The idea of control is fundamental at the very beginning of the life of a currency and an institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">In the meantime, the ECB has improved some specific procedures in order to avoid or, at least, to minimise problems arising from the fact that the availability of collateral varies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">However, as I said before, no system is without drawbacks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.77,0)">In the case of a fixed rate tender with allotment, problems can arise in the case of some banking institutions   operating in financial systems with a scarcity of collateral for several reasons: a low level of public debt, less tradition of loan securitisation, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">As examples of Eurosystem decisions to improve the procedures in order to avoid or minimise these kinds of problems, I shall mention two steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">One was clarifying to the counterparties that the correct interpretation of the General Documentation allows tender bids which are not actually covered by collateral at the time of the submission of bids, and that the only requirement is the financial capacity to have the collateral on the date of settlement of the tender.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Of course, the final settlement of the tender operation is subject to the availability of sufficient collateral to cover the allotted amount.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The second step, taken on 8 April 1999 when we decided to reduce the interest rates, was to establish a symmetric interest rate corridor between the repo rate on the one hand and the marginal lending facility and the marginal deposit facility on the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The markets could - and it actually seems that they did - infer that the overnight rate will tend to move around the middle point of the marginal facilities corridor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">If this is so, it is better for the time being   to have a symmetric corridor in order to signal that there is no reason for the overnight rate to stay necessarily above the repo rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.13,0)">By doing so, we avoid systematic arbitrage gains stemming from financial institutions asking for more liquidity than they actually need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">This is legitimate provided that they do not ask for more liquidity than the amount of collateral they can afford, but it gives a clear advantage to institutions operating in financial systems with a large stock of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Another good example of the Eurosystem choosing the appropriate instrument of monetary policy and of changing details of its application concerns the longer-term refinancing operations, which have a monthly frequency and a maturity of three months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.5,0)">Unlike the main refinancing operations, these consist of a variable rate tender, which is not intended to have its usual signalling effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">As you may know, the signalling effect of monetary policy is important and must be taken into account whenever choosing the appropriate instrument and using it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">For the sake of efficiency, the Governing Council of the ECB decided on 4 March 1999 to modify the tender method applying to longer-term refinancing operations, switching from a variable single rate auction   to a variable multiple rate auction  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Rather than describing to you all the Eurosystem's monetary policy tools in the part of my speech devoted to monetary policy implementation, I preferred to give you some examples of which instruments were chosen and on which grounds, and to demonstrate that an important task in these first 100 days of European Monetary Union has been to improve these instruments with a view to efficiency and fairness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">OTHER FUNCTIONS OF THE ESCB Nothing is more important for the conduct of monetary policy than good statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In this respect, I should like to highlight the progress, which the ESCB has made in this field, thanks to the efforts of the staff of both the ECB and of the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.12,0)">The ESCB has direct responsibility for preparing money and banking statistics and those relating to financial accounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It also has shared responsibility with EUROSTAT   for balance of payments statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Although the work has not yet been concluded, I wish to emphasise that the progress made has been considerable and that we now have the basic statistical information required for our monetary policy strategy and for taking appropriate decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.17,0)">As I often say when I comment on this point, you do not need a scalpel to cut a slice of bread.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">It is my understanding that, after 100 days of running, the payment systems function of the ESCB has had a positive result on balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Following an expected learning and adjustment period to become accustomed to the new procedures and techniques, the real-time gross settlement system   is functioning well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And, more importantly, the ESCB has alternative methods and contingency solutions, which can always be introduced if considered necessary or opportune.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">As the person directly responsible for the information and communication systems of the ECB, I must say - and this is not to my credit but to the credit of the staff of the ECB - that the information systems in general, and, in particular, both the technical infrastructure allowing the instantaneous transmission of data on monetary policy, and the communication systems required to co-ordinate the activity of the NCBs and of the ECB, are functioning perfectly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Another one of my specific responsibilities at the ECB involves the production and issuance of euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Several milestones were reached already on our road to prepare the euro banknotes, which will be issued in the year 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Thus, we decided in favour of a no pooling decentralised solution for the production of banknotes by the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We have finalised the so-called "zero production run", which involved the printing works of the participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The main purposes of this test were, first, to check the compliance of the "test banknotes" against the technical specifications and, second, to prove that all printing works are in a position to produce the euro banknotes to the same high quality standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The result of this test was positive, as only some minor technical specifications need to be modified slightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The printing works will now start their final preparations for the commencement of the mass production of the euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The Governing Council also decided to establish an Analysis Centre for Counterfeit Euro Banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">As is already indicated by its name, the main purpose of this Analysis Centre will be to technically analyse and classify new types of printed counterfeits, and to store the related technical data in a database.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The Analysis Centre will be located at the ECB in Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">FURTHER PERSPECTIVES OF THE EURO AND THE ESCB The future perspectives of the euro and the ESCB, to come to the last part of the title of my contribution, are clearly linked to the ideas of confidence and credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The main goals I am striving to achieve concerning the future perspectives of the euro and of the ESCB are, indeed, confidence and credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">All the technical achievements in monetary policy, payment systems, information systems, statistics, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.3,0)">are worth nothing if the euro and the ESCB do not manage to win the confidence of the 292 million citizens of the euro area, as the Deutsche Bundesbank did with the 82 million German citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The key to gaining confidence in the ESCB is, first, to be efficient, to be successful, in meeting the primary objective of price stability, for which an appropriate monetary policy is a necessary but not sufficient condition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">As stated before, in order to achieve stability, it is necessary to combine and co-ordinate with other economic policies, such as fiscal policy   and those relating to the supply side of the economy  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is also essential for the credibility of the ESCB that there is respect for its independence, with regard to the various functional, organic and personal aspects which independence encompasses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.2,0)">Independence does not mean no co-ordination or no communication, or a lack of transparency, or a lack of accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Accountability to the European Parliament and good communication with the public and with the markets is an essential condition for the credibility of the ESCB and for the efficiency of its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As I said before, it is important to remember that the impact of the monetary policy measures depends both on their mechanical effect and on their perception and interpretation by the public and by the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">A further key to the success of the ESCB is that it should act as what it is, a system, that is to say a harmonious and interdependent whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Co-ordination between the ECB and the NCBs, which up to now has been fully achieved, mainly thanks to the actions of the Governing Council and of the committees, is another factor for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Last but not least, a further key to the credibility of the euro and of the ESCB is the adoption of a European-wide perspective, with no national bias.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Efficiency, independence, accountability, transparency and communication, co-ordination and a European-wide perspective: these are the main ruling principles of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">They are certainly demanding conditions, but they are necessary in order to achieve credibility on the part of Europeans and those who wish to view the euro as a currency on which they can rely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Thank you very much.</span>
