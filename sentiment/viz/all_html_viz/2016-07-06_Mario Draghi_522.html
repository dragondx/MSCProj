    <span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)"> Eighth ECB Statistics Conference Welcome address by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Eighth ECB Statistics Conference, Central Bank Statistics: moving beyond the aggregates,Frankfurt am Main, 6 July 2016 Ladies and gentlemen, On behalf of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank  , allow me to warmly welcome you to the Eighth ECB Statistics Conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">These biennial conferences are by now a well-established tradition and always give new and valuable impetus to our work in the field of statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The title of today’s conference is “Central bank statistics: moving beyond the aggregates”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Disaggregated data are indeed necessary to identify and analyse the heterogeneity that characterises the real world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">For central banks this is particularly important: to implement policy in the most effective way, we need to know how our policy actions affect all sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.83,0)">Both the challenges posed by the current economic climate for monetary and macroprudential policy, and the information required to carry out microprudential supervision by the Single Supervisory Mechanism   increase our need for granular data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.11,0)">But this need for a greater level of disaggregation of data comes with its own challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The first one is to ensure that data are collected in a way that permits multiple uses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">This requires greater harmonisation, and an ability to share data between institutions in a way that still respects confidentiality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">The second challenge is to engage with the financial sector to ensure that the increase in data collection does not become burdensome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.41,0)">Why the need for granular data?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Improving the collection of disaggregated data will support the ECB’s main policy functions in several ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">On the monetary policy side, greater understanding of the functioning of money markets and of the impact of the monetary transmission mechanism on individual sub-sectors of the economy helps to underpin our analysis of unconventional monetary policy tools and to effectively target future measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Indeed, this week saw the official go-live of the reporting of data on up to 35,000 daily transactions in the money market, complete with information on quantities, prices and counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This is a very rich information set, crucial for our liquidity management and for understanding the first step of the monetary transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Collecting more granular data also helps us to better understand the transmission process through the economy more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We need more information on the linkages between individual sectors of the economy and, even more so, between large financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.94,0)">There are some important areas of the financial sector where we lack complete statistical coverage, especially relating to what we call the “shadow banking system”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">These areas include some complex market products and instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Similarly, our new responsibilities in European banking supervision call for new data concepts and definitions, greatly extending the need for granular data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">A successful start has been made, with a new set of legal acts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The collection of loan-by-loan data is already being implemented, but further improvements are possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In particular, we need to make sure that the data we collect are of a high quality and comparable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Effective data integration and cooperation But today’s conference is about more than just collecting additional data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.79,0)">The sharing of data by authorities is also critical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Doing this effectively and efficiently, while maintaining data confidentiality, is a priority for policymakers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It requires action from policy institutions and lawmakers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Putting in place the right architecture will permit a faster and more efficient response to requests across all our policy areas, greatly enhancing the usefulness of granular data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">We have made some progress on the legal foundations for sharing granular data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Council Regulation 2533/98 has been amended to permit the ECB to  use confidential statistical information to perform its supervisory tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The information can also be shared with Union institutions, including supervisory and resolution authorities, the European Systemic Risk Board and the European Stability Mechanism for the purposes of prudential supervision and ensuring financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">This is a major achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The European System of Central Banks   has also taken important steps to improve the harmonisation and standardisation of data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The current work on the Banks’ Integrated Reporting Dictionary, a joint project involving seven national central banks and 26 commercial banks under the leadership of the ECB, is the best example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">This process could and should ultimately enable us to organise the various reporting requirements into a single, comprehensive and harmonised European Reporting Framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">But the need for harmonisation and standardisation also extends beyond Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Finance is a global business, and both the regulation and the underlying data requirements for global institutions would benefit from more harmonisation worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Concrete steps towards standardisation include the establishment of mandatory requirements regarding the use of the International Securities Identification Number and the global Legal Entity Identifier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Europe should retain its prominent role in the implementation of the second phase of the G20 Data Gaps Initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.43,0)">Engagement with industry As the banking industry has pointed out, lack of standardisation pushes up costs for the private sector and heightens the risk of mistakes or misinterpretation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And there is some truth to this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Policymakers and the industry clearly have a shared interest in focusing on and discussing data collection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">It would allow banks to contain their reporting burden and remain competitive at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">And it would allow policymakers to improve the quality and relevance of the data they receive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The two groups have quite different roles, but they also share common goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As such, data collection should be a joint exercise carried out by the authorities and the banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">They can support each other and jointly benefit from the results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">After all, there is likely to be a large overlap between the data the authorities need and the data managers of a financial institution require for their own purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Standardising the identifiers of counterparties, transactions, products and reporting requirements in general falls within our mandate and is probably our best course of action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I know that this is easier said than done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">The establishment of European banking supervision under the auspices of the ECB, and of the three European Supervisory Authorities,  gives us a unique opportunity to make progress in this area in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Conclusion Let me finish by saying that the well-established ESCB statistics will continue to provide the “big picture” of economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But we should also offer a magnifying glass.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Looking at the details beyond the aggregates enriches our understanding of economic phenomena and at the same time increases our flexibility to respond to unexpected policy needs, contributing to even better statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">So, once again, I welcome you to this conference and also take this opportunity to thank all the organisers for their efforts in making it happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">I wish all of you an interesting and successful day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">I hope you find some answers to the challenges I have mentioned, and I look forward to hearing the results of your discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.09,0)">The European Banking Authority, European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority and European Securities and Markets Authority.</span>
