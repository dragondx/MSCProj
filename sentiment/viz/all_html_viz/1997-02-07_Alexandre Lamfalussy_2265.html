    <h2> Address by Alexandre Lamfalussy, President of the European Monetary Institute on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the new Hungarian banking system, Budapest, 7 February 1997 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Alexandre Lamfalussy </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)"> Conference organised by the Hungarian Banking Association Address by Alexandre Lamfalussy, President of the European Monetary Institute on the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the new Hungarian banking system, Budapest, 7 February 1997 For at least three reasons, I have accepted with pleasure the invitation to share some thoughts with you on the occasion of these tenth anniversary celebrations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">First, for obvious personal reasons, I enjoy spending some time in Hungary - even if it is only for less than a day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Second, I am absolutely convinced that an efficient financial system in general, and an efficient banking system in particular, together comprise an indispensable precondition for the proper functioning of a market economy and, indeed, for economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.74,0)">Not a sufficient condition, but a necessary one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Third, I note that Hungary has made substantial progress in this direction in four key areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The larger part of the Hungarian banking system is now in genuinely private hands; the financial health of most banks   has improved; the legal, accounting and regulatory framework has been consolidated, and, last but not least, there is now an interbank payment system in place which can no longer be qualified as prehistoric.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Admittedly, in all these areas progress is still possible and desirable, but what has been achieved so far now enables you to address a number of institutional issues for the solution of which Western experience is fast becoming increasingly and directly relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But before considering some of these issues, allow me to make some remarks about the macroeconomic situation of the Hungarian economy and about the new framework within which the National Bank of Hungary will be operating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Both these areas are of key importance for the management of your banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">At the same time, both have a bearing on Hungary's declared intention to join the European Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Last but not least, both are important areas in themselves, irrespective of considerations relating to European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">THE MACROECONOMIC SITUATION That there has been a significant improvement since mid-1995 in Hungary's macroeconomic situation is beyond doubt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Here are a few facts and comments on some of the features of this improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.9,0)">The current account deficit reached $3.5 billion in 1993 and almost $4 billion in 1994, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.77,0)">more than 10% of GDP - an obviously unsustainable situation by any standards, but even more so for a country with a high debt ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Some of this deficit was covered by direct foreign investment, but the greater part of it was financed by borrowing, as a result of which by the end of 1994 the net external debt had reached 46% of GDP and the exceptionally high level of more than 160% of exports of goods and services and unrequited transfers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.11,0)">I have not yet seen the full 1996 figures, but estimates based on the first eleven months suggest a current account deficit of around   $1.5 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">This looks much more reasonable, not only because it was more than covered by foreign direct investment but also because of what lies behind this improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The $2.5 billion drop in the current account deficit between 1994 and 1996 was made possible   by a 35% increase in exports, accompanied by a modest increase in imports of about 14%, and   by the steady and rapid increase in services income, mainly   derived from tourism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.31,0)">Since there was also a sizable inflow of foreign direct investment in 1995 and 1996, the country's net external debt dropped from $18.9 billion at end-1994 to about $13.3 billion at end-1996.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.81,0)">Net external debt declined to 31.2 expressed as a percentage of GDP, and to 71.6 as a percentage of exports of goods, services and unrequited transfers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.31,0)">I have also noted that by 1996 net interest payments on the external debt had dropped to 6.7 as a percentage of exports of goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The comparable figures were 12% in 1994 and as high as 17% in 1990.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.61,0)">It is useful to point out that the sizable decline of the net external debt was made possible by the substantial decline of the public sector deficit from 8.2% of GDP in 1994 to 4% in 1996, while at the same time the share of public sector expenditure in GDP declined from 62% to a more bearable 51%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">"Growing out" of the debt service burden is no longer wishful thinking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It is beginning to become a reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">The fact I find most noteworthy is that the $2.5 billion switch of resources towards external use, amounting to some 7% of GDP, took place without a recession, which is unusual for such a large switch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">It was even accompanied by a small increase in GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">This would not have been possible without the fast growth of exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The remarkable growth of labour productivity in industry - of close to 60% between 1992 and 1996 - played a major role in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This growth, together with the changing composition of exports, suggests that the structural transformation of the Hungarian economy has gone quite far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The growth of net services exports points in the same direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">So much for the bright side of the picture, which is a good thing but should not be overstated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">First, these are improvements in comparison with the unsustainable imbalances which characterised both the situation prevailing in 1988-89 and that of the years 1993-94.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.33,0)">Second, the price paid by the majority of Hungarians was very heavy indeed: a drop in net real earnings of 12% in 1995, followed by another of 4% last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.1,0)">Even if this was arguably unavoidable, given the size of the imbalances which had to be corrected  , the size of the sacrifices remains a fact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.11,0)">Against this background, any further erosion of average living standards would be just as unsustainable as were the macroeconomic imbalances in 1993-94.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.58,0)">Third, the rate of inflation is still far too high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.01,0)">Admittedly, since the post-devaluation peak reached in the late spring of 1995 - of more than 30% - the rate has been declining steadily, to stand by December last year at a shade below 20%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.66,0)">But I am seriously worried by the fact that the Hungarian rate of inflation, while never moving towards three digits, has remained stuck within the 18-35% range over the past seven years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.64,0)">The worst was avoided by maintaining positive real interest rates during the greater part of this period, but the distorting effects of such inflation rates on the economy remain substantial, not to mention their socially unacceptable impact on those people whose earnings cannot be adjusted to inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.23,0)">Looking ahead, I hope that you will bear with me if I become a little philosophical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">All knowledgeable observers of Hungarian history, ancient as well as contemporary, agree that Hungarians possess the very rare ability to pull back at the last minute from the brink of disaster or at least to extricate themselves from a seemingly hopeless situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.01,0)">They unfortunately also note that once the Hungarians have done so, they miss the opportunity offered by their own success to carry out policies with a long-term perspective in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I do hope that history will not repeat itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.55,0)">Admittedly, any further decline in the average living standard would be unacceptable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">The standard of living should be allowed to begin to rise - but only to the extent that this does not upset the basic balance of the economy again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">At the same time, the reduction in inflation must continue at a pace which puts the attainment of single-digit inflation in sight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.63,0)">You must break out - downwards - of the 18 to 35% range.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And, last but not least, the country will have to begin to tackle earnestly the major structural problems related to the pension, health care, education and social security systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">These are daunting challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Two reminders may help when tackling them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The first is that Hungary has managed major breakthroughs in the recent past which were just as difficult as these future challenges: over the past five years, real privatisation accompanied by a fundamental shift in the structure of industry and services; and, more recently, the handling of a macroeconomic crisis situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The second is that most of these challenges are akin to those encountered by modern Western societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">For these challenges Hungary is in good company.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">THE MONETARY POLICY ENVIRONMENT Two recent changes have occurred regarding the institutional environment in which the National Bank of Hungary is operating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">I welcome both of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.56,0)">The possibility of the direct financing of the budget deficit by the NBH has been eliminated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This is in conformity with the provisions of the Maastricht Treaty, and is a measure which has already been implemented by all fifteen member countries of the European Union and which the EMI closely monitors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">To remind you, this provision of the Treaty applies to the member countries at this stage, prior to effectively entering EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It would seem to me impossible for Hungary to join the European Union without this change in the law governing the operations of the NBH, even if Hungary's participation in the euro area were to come at a later stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.95,0)">But this is only an institutional or political argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.0,0)">There is more to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Maastricht or no Maastricht, eliminating the direct monetary financing of budget deficits is simply economic common sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.96,0)">In the long run, inflation is a monetary phenomenon: it cannot happen without an   accommodating expansion of the money supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And we know from historical experience that more often than not the major source of any such inflationary increase in the money supply has been the direct financing of government by the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Hungary has not been an exception to this general rule - rather its confirmation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">And once inflation is established, interest rates go up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.66,0)">Except for very short periods, it is impossible to keep market interest rates below the rate of inflation: who would be ready to undertake financial savings the remuneration of which would imply a loss in real financial wealth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.91,0)">To try to keep interest rates low by monetary financing of the government is a self-defeating device.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">It may work for a few months, but would end up producing more inflation and higher, not lower, interest rates - certainly higher nominal interest rates, but very likely also higher real rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The simple reason for this is that people are not fools - at least not for a long time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.05,0)">Monetary financing of the government is therefore likely to combine two evils at the same time: inflation and high interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.3,0)">The accumulated and potential future losses of the NBH on account of its borrowings in foreign currency have been taken over by the government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.76,0)">This is a salutary cleaning-up operation which ought to have been carried out long ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.48,0)">It has no consequences for the "real" economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These borrowings have been undertaken in the past on government instruction and with government approval, with the NBH acting solely as an intermediary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.5,0)">The NBH's only shareholder is the Hungarian State; the real burden of the State's direct or indirect external borrowing has to be borne by the present or future taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.19,0)">This real burden was to some extent hidden by the "seigniorage" profits of the NBH, which had two consequences: they hid the size of this burden from public view; and they distorted the NBH's accounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.79,0)">As all experts know, the size of this double distortion was proportional to the rate of inflation, and was aggravated by the NBH's sterilisation policy of large capital inflows, without which, however, inflation would not have been brought down from 30 to 20% within the past eighteen months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.7,0)">Sterilisation was therefore a wise policy; the real culprit is the rate of inflation, which is much higher in Hungary than in the countries whose currencies were used for borrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.48,0)">In a sentence: this long overdue measure serves both public transparency and democratic accountability   - even if the general public, or politicians, may be excused for not fully understanding the intricate interconnection between accounting procedures in a country with high inflation and the processes of the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.03,0)">This is a good example of the generalised mess created by inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">CHALLENGES FOR THE HUNGARIAN BANKS As I said right at the outset, it is now time to look ahead and begin to address some major issues for the Hungarian banks - issues which, thanks to the progress made over the past few years, are no longer totally dissimilar from those facing banks in western Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I intend to make a few comments on these, since they are issues on which I can possibly throw some light on the basis of my own professional experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The first is about the specificity of banking, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">about the possibility or desirability of clearly distinguishing banks, through rules and regulations, from other financial intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">I noted that the recent changes in Hungarian banking law have implied a movement towards the de-specialisation of banks, notably in the field of securities transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">I believe that a development towards the universal banking model is justified - on certain conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is justified for two groups of reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.72,0)">First, because financial innovation in general, and securitisation in particular, are breaking down the traditionally neat distinction between banks and other financial intermediaries, indeed even between financial intermediation and financial markets, all over the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.76,0)">Some time ago, banks were defined as financial intermediaries whose liabilities   were equivalent to the money supply, and the money supply was defined as the total sum of bank liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This nice circular definition kept academics, bank regulators and central bankers equally happy until the moment when financial innovation started blurring the distinction between money and other financial assets, and securitisation began blurring the distinction between financial intermediation and financial market operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.07,0)">The proliferation of derivatives, financial futures and the like added to the confusion between balance sheet and off-balance sheet items.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.5,0)">The result is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to identify banking on the basis of the old equivalence of "banking liabilities = money supply".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">This has now been recognised in the sweeping deregulation of banking activities affecting the whole of western Europe and, though more cautiously, also the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In some cases this has gone so far as to allow the emergence of consolidated banking and insurance activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Second, in a shorter Hungarian perspective, banks in Hungary have a head start on other financial intermediaries in collecting the financial savings of households and of the enterprise sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Admittedly, Hungary badly needs the large-scale development of life assurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds and the like, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">all those institutional investors which can channel savings towards equity investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.72,0)">But this takes time, since experience and human resources are rare and the reform of the pension system and of health services takes time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Banks should be allowed to fill the gap for the time being, by putting at the disposal of savers a wide variety of financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Now let me come to the risks that a generalised move towards universal banking could entail, and the ways and means of containing them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.02,0)">The main risk, of course, is the emergence of conflicts of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.1,0)">One such potential conflict of interest may arise within any bank, between the bank's own risk-taking activity and risk-taking for its customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.17,0)">The classic example of this is the potential conflict of interest between credit-granting and securities underwriting, but this is only one example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.92,0)">The traditional way of avoiding the misuse of such conflict-creating situations is   to devise an organisational structure with clearly distinguishable lines of responsibility,   to avoid flows of "inside" information between the various activities,   to attribute to each activity costs, income and profits, and   to entrust external auditors with the surveillance of the systems put in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.82,0)">The end-result will, of course, never be entirely safe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.94,0)">Moreover, the building of "Chinese walls" inside a multi-polar banking organisation may weaken, or even destroy, the synergy between those poles, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.1,0)">it may undermine the rationale of a multi-polar organisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.18,0)">I would not want, however, to overstate the internal conflict of interest argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In the long run, the kind of conflict to which I have referred is unlikely to be very strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.16,0)">In a longer-term perspective, no bank can afford to favour its own risk-taking activity at the expense of its customers - especially if auditing makes it certain that any misuse of the bank's powers would come to light.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.79,0)">Another much more dangerous conflict of interest could arise where the bank is capable of exercising a decisive shareholding power in another non-banking firm, of which it is at the same time a major creditor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.32,0)">This could have unacceptable consequences not only for the firm's other shareholders but, if the practice became widespread, could even lead to structural distortions for entire industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.48,0)">To avoid this happening, I would favour rather strict regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.43,0)">For instance, mutual funds managed by banks should either have limits on the equity participation in individual firms or not have access to the firm's Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.34,0)">The same should apply, a fortiori, to any bank's direct and permanent equity participation in a non-banking firm - unless, perhaps, the bank remains just a shareholder  , without direct banking operations with the firm in question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Under the last point, I already touched on one particular aspect of corporate governance, namely when a bank can play a decisive role in a non-banking firm's life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.19,0)">But you will also have to face up to the reverse problem: when a non-banking firm becomes a bank's key shareholder and could therefore potentially induce risk-taking by the bank in its favour, at the expense of the bank's other shareholders or of its depositors or customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.0,0)">This is a particularly acute danger in countries where there are not many non-bank institutional shareholders, where the defence of minority shareholders has no tradition and where depositors are not properly protected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.88,0)">Such problems have been encountered in Western market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">It is clearly in Hungary's interest to build up, or consolidate, the appropriate defences against the emergence of such problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In order to avoid any misunderstandings, I am not launching any appeal in favour of overregulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.89,0)">In a market economy, the best regulator is the market itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">And when spontaneous market regulation fails - which does happen - the second-best solution is to use regulatory techniques which favour the emergence of market-led self-regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.65,0)">I am simply trying to make two points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">First, that banking and finance have broader and more general implications for the economy as a whole than any other kind of activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.93,0)">A crisis in, say, the steel industry creates hardship, but it does not create a general crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.71,0)">A banking crisis may well do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Second, banking and finance are evolving at a very fast pace under the combined influence of technological progress, innovation and globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">This needs a careful adjustment of the regulatory framework, not its general weakening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In a very different area, may I call your attention to the need to develop both retail banking in the narrow sense of the term and also banking services to the dynamic sector of small and medium-sized enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.53,0)">In these fields, Hungarian banking is vastly underdeveloped, both in the number of consumer-friendly local offices and, even more importantly, in the range of high-quality banking services offered to these two groups of customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.05,0)">This underdevelopment is particularly striking when it is compared with the sophistication of some of the wholesale banking activities being offered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.44,0)">This is most regrettable and goes against the long-term interests of the banks themselves, not to mention those of the country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Households are, and will remain, the major source of the country's financial savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">They deserve to be supplied with appropriate, safe and diversified vehicles which allow them to find an outlet for their financial wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.96,0)">Some small and medium-sized firms are net savers; others desperately need financing for development purposes, which financial markets will not be able to provide for a very long time indeed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">I have known of a number of western European and even North American banks which derived great strength from their solid retail banking basis, which helped them considerably in situations in which some, if not many, of their cherished wholesale customers went bust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">You will also need the retail banking basis for another reason.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Satisfied household and small enterprise customers provide you with the greatest public support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">And I can assure you that you will need this support in a democratic society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.46,0)">Banking has never been, and is unlikely to become, a popular activity, especially when it relies exclusively on customers recruited from among large corporations and very wealthy individuals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.01,0)">Beware of the danger of political backlash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In developing your retail activities, you will have to monitor western European experiences carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Many western European countries are overbanked in this field, and a good deal of discussion is focusing on the merits of customer proximity versus home-computer banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">My feeling is that you will be able to avoid some of the earlier western European excesses, and rely directly on the most recent communications and information systems technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But for a long time to come, most of your customers will need close human proximity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The comparative assessment of the costs and benefits of these two approaches will be a very great challenge for the Hungarian banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">I hope that in ten years' time, if I am still around, I shall be able to congratulate you on having been able to successfully meet this challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Meanwhile, I wish you good luck - and the ability to help the emergence of good luck by hard work, skilful management and good strategic choices.</span>
