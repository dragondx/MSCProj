    <h3> Speaker: Peter Praet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)"> Monetary policy in the context of balance sheet adjustments Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Peterson Institute for International Economics, Washington DC, 22 May 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen,   It is a great pleasure to speak to you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">I would like to use this opportunity to discuss the ECB’s monetary policy response to the profound balance sheet adjustments currently taking place in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.76,0)">Like in most developed economies, different sectors in different euro area countries have entered into a deep deleveraging phase over recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.05,0)">A deleveraging phase follows a credit boom gone into reverse: financial and non-financial firms shift their focus from exploiting business opportunities to reducing risk exposure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Likewise, households seek to clean their balance sheets from sources of vulnerability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Deleveraging presents central banks with a delicate balancing act: It is a necessary and healthy reversal of past borrowing excesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.17,0)">To that extent, policy-makers should not stand in the way of “the invisible hand”   that trims balance sheets to sustainable proportions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.39,0)">Unless the oppressive load of debt and capital overhangs is run down, the misallocation of resources will constrain future opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.88,0)">Solving a stock problem today means resolving a chronic flow problem – anaemic income, production and expenditure – for years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.07,0)">At the same time, deleveraging carries risks if it is abrupt and disorderly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.1,0)">Accelerated deleveraging by the financial industry brings with itself the threat of a protracted suspension in financial intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.65,0)">In a worst-case scenario, this can lead to a fully-fledged financial meltdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.06,0)">But, even if the meltdown scenario is avoided, lack of finance adds to the economic headwinds by suppressing investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.65,0)">Sluggish investment, in turn, lowers income and prices, thus reinforcing deleveraging pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.5,0)">If this cycle of adverse externalities across sectors sets in, the ensuing deleveraging spiral becomes a matter of public policy concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.38,0)">It becomes a monetary policy concern to the extent that it impairs the transmission of monetary policy signals to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Central banks thus have a role to play in managing the deleveraging process, knowing that crisis management has to complement, but should not obstruct, crisis resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.93,0)">They must ensure that the economy does not enter into a downward spiral that would be inconsistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">But how can they succeed in this task without delaying structural repair?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Do they have the tools?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">If not, who can complete the policy framework?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">How can central banks align short-term crisis fighting efforts with their longer-term monetary policy strategies and mandates?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.95,0)">These are the questions that currently preoccupy central bankers around the globe, albeit to different degrees and a varying sense of urgency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me frame these preoccupations today with a euro area perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">I will proceed in three steps: First, I will highlight the key challenges that central banks and policy makers face when formulating their crisis response in the context of acute deleveraging pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Second, I will explain how the ECB has responded to these challenges and how other policy domains have to contribute to tackling the deleveraging risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Finally, I will reflect on how the institutional framework of Economic and Monetary Union   in Europe directs, complements and bolsters the ECB’s crisis response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.77,0)">Ongoing balance sheet adjustments Leverage cycles are difficult for central banks to tame, essentially for two reasons: first, they are difficult to empirically identify, measure and describe with available analytical tools, especially in real-time; second, even if analysts found ways to spot them with reasonable accuracy in real-time, central banks and other macro-policy authorities may need to apply an atypical degree of inventiveness to control the potential macroeconomic fall-out, when leveraging finally goes into reverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me explain these two issues one-by-one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.91,0)">1.1 Identification of the leveraging cycles First of all, it is financial cycles, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.55,0)">long and deep swings in asset values, that policy authorities essentially care about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.78,0)">They do not necessarily care about leveraging per se.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.86,0)">Leveraging cycles become the problem because, as has long been recognised, swings in asset prices do not pose serious threats to the economy, unless they are facilitated and compounded by trends in debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This combination and mutual feed-backs between trends in asset values and sustained movements in leverage are what James Tobin defined the “Achilles heel of capitalism.” So, let me concentrate on leveraging cycles, knowing that it is in fact this mutually reinforcing process between debt and financial values that we fear most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.84,0)">Leveraging and deleveraging cycles are difficult to interpret and turning points hard to identify.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.34,0)">Is a debt hump that leads to a surge in the average loan-to-income ratio justified by an increase in future incomes?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.12,0)">Or is it a reflection of imprudent behaviour?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.99,0)">Or is it a gamble for survival?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.87,0)">It is difficult for a central bank to pass a clear-cut judgement in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This problem is not unlike the well-known identification problem for business cycles, but it applies to deleveraging to an even greater extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Traditionally, and until very recently, published empirical analysis has not supported policy practitioners too generously in their effort to divine the direction of financial trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The crisis has of course propelled the study of the leverage cycles to the forefront of research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.18,0)">But statistical inference is imperfect when it comes to real-time identification of underlying tendencies which take a long time to develop and emerge to observation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.4,0)">For example, Drehmann, Borio and Tsatsaronis   at the BIS have used a methodology to visually chart how leveraging and deleveraging waves interact with the business cycle, occasionally coming to a coincidental climax that makes the successive turning of both waves very deep and prolonged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">That methodology identifies also points which – ex post – you would understand as changes in direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.35,0)">But the usual problem that we encounter in identifying business recoveries and recessions when they start is amplified here by a factor of In order to identify business cycles you need statistic filters with frequencies from 1 to 8 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">To do the same for leveraging cycles – at least in the sample of advanced industrial countries that the BIS study surveys – you need a 16 year frequency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.92,0)">This obviously calls for long spells of data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.63,0)">And, the two-sided structure of the filter stretches data requirements even further – into the unknown future!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">So, the approach – interesting and informative as it is for retrospective inference – is not yet fully applicable for policy purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.54,0)">Other detectors of the state of leveraging and the risks originating from leveraging cycles exist, some of them using combinations of warning indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For instance, Alessi and Detken   use indicators, inter alia, of private credit to parse out costly boom-bust episodes from garden-variety changes in asset prices in real-time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Claessens, Kose and Terrones   characterise the interplay of cycles between different market segments, including credit, housing and equity markets, and between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Also exploiting cross-correlations between various market segments, Holló, Lo Duca and Kremer   develop a composite indicator to measure systemic stress in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Reading this analysis, we know that the credit-intensity of the expansion phase is closely associated with the severity of the recession phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.43,0)">A stronger increase in financial leverage, measured by the rate of change of bank credit relative to GDP in the prior boom, tends to correlate with a deeper subsequent downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.85,0)">We know that credit changes its nature as the leveraging cycle progresses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It is a facilitating factor in the run-up stage of the boom, when agents are intent on maximising return opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And it turns into a forcing factor when the first – and almost exclusive – business priority for over-indebted agents becomes reducing indebtedness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.55,0)">As Jordà, Schularik and Taylor   report on the title of their paper on credit cycles, “credit bites back”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">These analytical efforts, along with the other work currently conducted in this vibrant strand of literature, clearly enhance our appreciation of risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">At the same time, further research will be necessary to operationalize these findings in a way that can reliably guide policy-makers in a real-time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For example, more analysis is needed on how different policy action would feed back into the different indicators of financial market risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.66,0)">1.2 The many facets of liquidity and their interaction with leverage cycles As I mentioned earlier, the second reason for macroeconomic authorities to be wary of leveraging cycles is that their reversal poses policy challenges of unconventional intensity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.5,0)">The reason is that deleveraging cycles interact with liquidity cycles in complicated and sometimes impenetrable ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Before explaining these interactions, let me introduce some additional taxonomy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.15,0)">What is a liquidity cycle?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In fact, there are several important concepts and definitions of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">One crucial distinction refers to asset market versus funding liquidity: Asset market liquidity measures the ease with which an asset is traded at any time with little price concessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.57,0)">It reflects the cost per unit of time of converting a financial asset into money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.05,0)">When market liquidity collapses – in a liquidity crisis – assets that had enjoyed high tradability become illiquid in the sense that trimming exposures is possible only at a large penalty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Funding liquidity – an alternative, if complementary concept – measures the ability of a financial institution which engages in maturity transformation to obtain constant funding for its long-term assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This distinction is at the centre of Brunnermeier’s and Pedersen’s   analysis on the interplay between leverage and liquidity cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Here, the authors show the reinforcing nature of funding shocks and leverage in shadow-banking intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.89,0)">Here, a funding shock materialises in the form of higher haircuts in the repo market, where intermediaries operating in the shadow-banking market – say, a hedge fund – finance the acquisition of assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.2,0)">For a hedge fund that is financing asset holdings in the repo market, mechanically, a rise in haircuts that is not offset by either slack in the existing equity capital base or an infusion of fresh equity capital will cause the fund to liquidate assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.16,0)">A collective trend to liquidate assets cannot happen unless prices drop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.19,0)">But a fall-off in asset prices devalues the collateral that is pledged in parallel leveraged operations and more margin calls are triggered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.71,0)">So, the original funding liquidity shock turns into an asset market liquidity shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.85,0)">The latter then retroacts into a more severe and widespread funding liquidity problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.04,0)">As the haircut increases in the adverse liquidity conditions that I have described, the leveraging potential of the shadow-bank plunges almost mechanically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.7,0)">These notions of liquidity cycles – and their interactions with leverage – are now almost old hat for macroeconomists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.1,0)">But there is another representation of a liquidity cycle that has escaped much academic investigation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.74,0)">This representation distinguishes different types of liquidity depending on its issuer: Outside liquidity comprises currency or, more generally, central bank overnight liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.33,0)">These liabilities are what we typically understand as “money” in the narrowest sense of the word.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In our modern fiat-money systems, this form of money is backed by a legal and social promise to essentially preserve its purchasing power and transaction services over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Inside liquidity is a much broader object, including short-dated money-like liabilities that are issued by the private entities and thus backed by private credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.67,0)">They would cancel out if all the claims held by banks on private creditors were to be settled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.08,0)">So, it is one form of currency that is created – and can be destroyed – within the private economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.51,0)">On the basis of this distinction, we can explain another type of liquidity cycle, which I will refer to as the “outside-inside” liquidity cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.22,0)">This cycle reflects the alternating phases and sometimes wild swings characterising banks’ demand for precautionary buffers of outside money from the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.41,0)">Again, the alternating phases of this type of cycle come to interplay with the underlying deleveraging course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.15,0)">And they do so in a way that can strongly complicate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.31,0)">1.3 The scope and limits for central banks to control leveraging cycles Let me describe how these complications played out in the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.24,0)">In the early days of the financial crisis, banks were saddled with a legacy of illiquid and unprofitable assets, which they were forced to refinance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.22,0)">As the markets had withdrawn credit, and the price of those assets in the market had plunged, they came to central banks for refinancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This produced a huge expansion in central bank liquidity which banks were drawing into the system as central bank credit was replacing private finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.65,0)">Because the network of interbank trading had seized up almost entirely, banks with excess deposits were unwilling to lend to banks with a structural funding shortfall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The trading gap was filled by the ECB, which was asked to absorb the liquidity supplied by the former and give more credit to the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.64,0)">In other words, outside liquidity substituted for an erosion of inside liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">As a consequence, in the ten months following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, outstanding ECB credit to euro area banks rose by around 90%, while the outstanding volumes of euro liquidity deposited overnight with the ECB went from virtually zero to three-digit billion figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">By any account – whether measured on the ECB’s assets side or on its liabilities side – the demand for central bank liquidity had reached unprecedented peaks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.77,0)">That was the first stage of a very severe outside-inside liquidity cycle, which central banks – everywhere – had to accommodate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.43,0)">For instance, in the nine months after Lehman total assets of the euro area banking system fell by around one percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.58,0)">So, banks needed an outsized volume of liquidity at hand in order to be able to refinance a balance sheet that had remained more or less constant at around its pre-crisis size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The early steps of the outside-inside liquidity cycle – the phase in which banks’ demand for outside liquidity surges – were effectively cushioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.6,0)">Successive rate cuts since the onset of the crisis have brought our main policy rates to historical lows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Our standard liquidity facilities have been expanded in maturity and used to channel unlimited liquidity at a certain price to provide funding reassurance to euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">For example, in a bold step, the maturity of our lending operations was extended to three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In two long-term refinancing operations which we launched at the end of 2011 and early 2012 banks absorbed a net volume of EUR 500 billion in additional liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.29,0)">The replacement of central bank liquidity for failing market credit has averted devastating prospects of a fully-fledged financial depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Our measures were instrumental in cushioning the value-destroying deleveraging forces that could have developed into a deflationary spiral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But, with a certain lag, the de-leveraging cycle started at some point to run its own course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.55,0)">Banks began shedding assets – either because those illiquid, unprofitable exposures had run off in the meantime, or because they had been written down, or because other, more profitable, assets had been sold at a profit, to make up for losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.56,0)">Or simply because banks had realised that their old business model was unsustainable and the size of their activities had to be reduced discretely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.69,0)">Whatever the reason behind a down-sizing of banks’ balance sheets, when they embarked on large scale deleveraging, their liquidity needs declined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.76,0)">So, they started shedding central bank liquidity as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The liquidity surge is being gradually unwound, bringing the outside-inside liquidity cycle to a mature stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">One manifestation of this unwinding of exceptional liquidity demand is the early repayment of the ECB’s three-year refinancing operations that have amounted to more than €280bn to date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The voluntary reimbursement of liquidity can be interpreted as a good sign, as it largely reflects normalisation in banks’ funding conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">When we explore the determinants of reimbursements, we see that it comes together with a measurable return of retail lending to banks that had long suffered loss of funding, and, for some of them, even a timid resurgence of wholesale borrowing activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">So, the shrinking of liquidity demand has a positive connotation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.16,0)">But the potentially difficult aspect of this process for a central bank is that the demand for central bank liquidity and the underlying de-leveraging process are not synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.76,0)">In fact, the demand for central bank liquidity   may drop just when the de-leveraging cycle starts producing its effects on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.53,0)">This intersection between the two cycles can be risky for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.93,0)">Asset shedding can be as extreme and divorced from fundamentals as the build-up of debt that had preceded – and largely caused – the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">So, as I said at the start, the central bank may have to be vigilant that the pace of asset reduction by banks is commensurate with an evolution of income, activity and employment that does not create downside risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.82,0)">But this policy strategy may be difficult to pursue in a situation in which banks’ propensity to absorb central bank liquidity is muted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.19,0)">The short-term crisis response Does this mean that, in the dark-grey zone of intersection between the two cycles, policy is left impotent?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The answer is: absolutely no.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">But the complexities and risks that I tried to describe require a well-designed, multidimensional and consistent policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">First and foremost, what’s needed is a thorough and transparent identification of risks on bank balance sheets and a robust reconstruction of equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">This is not limited to banks – households’ and firms’ own capital should be reinforced too, if they are to withstand future shocks and restart planning growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.42,0)">But it particularly applies to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.7,0)">This call for balance sheet repair may sound like the ceterum censeo of anyone commenting on the financial sector these days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">But we should not forget the successful practical precedents to underpin these calls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">For example, the Nordic banking crisis in the 1990s provides a case study of how decisive and well-targeted crisis management can mitigate and shorten the damaging effects of deleveraging stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.37,0)">With an external crisis constraining the room for manoeuvre for monetary policy and fiscal policy alike, the authorities addressed balance sheet repair head-on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.17,0)">They first forced a comprehensive recognition of losses on their domestic banking systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Then, they recapitalised institutions subject to stringent stress tests, sorting institutions based on viability, and dealing with bad assets through disposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.35,0)">And, finally, they ensured a reduction in excess capacity in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">More recently, we saw important financial reform put into practice in some euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.29,0)">Most notably, one year ago, the Spanish banking system was ostracised in the inter-bank market and deserted by capital investors and depositors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.73,0)">Adverse selection was in full display: uncertainty about the location and extent of exposures to the real estate sector was heavily weighing on the stability and viability of the Spanish banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The authorities, within the new European Stability Mechanism framework for financial stability assistance, took an approach in many respects similar to that followed 15 years before by Sweden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">First, they embarked on a serious mapping of the problem through a detailed, state-of-the-art stress testing exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.47,0)">Second came a surgical separation and removal of assets of dubious quality for those banks which had detected capital shortfalls and proved most vulnerable to future shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Third, loss recognition and recapitalisation took place by activating the European Stability Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Fourth, they put in place a comprehensive and innovative regulatory reform which empowers authorities to take timely and decisive action for bank recovery and resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.71,0)">It is too early to declare victory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.66,0)">And many challenges still loom ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.24,0)">But today, many of the banks that had suffered from a generalised loss of confidence have returned to the market and see their funding gaps decline rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">In fact, in a sign of normalisation, some of them have participated en force in the early repayment of the long-term refinancing that they had requested 18 months ago in very tense liquidity conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Obviously many of the measures involved in these policy efforts go well beyond the tasks and powers of the ECB as a monetary policy-maker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In fact, many of the necessary steps will need to be taken in other policy domains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">But the ECB can flank and support some of these steps, in particular, by forcefully responding to price stability risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">To that effect, monetary policy will continue employing its existing instruments and if necessary to expand its instrument set within the safeguards established by its strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">The long-term ECB strategy To be successful in delivering on its mandate in troubled waters, the ECB’s strategy has to combine two main attributes: it must be sufficiently flexible to adjust its policy conduct to the specific challenges at hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">And it must be sufficiently binding to anchor expectations and build central bank credibility with market participants and the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The flexibility of the ECB’s monetary policy framework derives from three features: The first is a definition of price stability, which is formulated in terms of a range, with an explicit focal point for policy identified within that range.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The range is defined as comprising rates of inflation which do not distort economic decisions: positive inflation rates of no more than two per cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Within that range the ECB’s Governing Council aims at attaining a level of inflation over the medium term – the focal point of policy – which is “ close to” the upper ceiling of two per cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The buffer interval between our focal point and the floor of the range serves as a safeguard against deflation risks for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">It also allows monetary policy to account for inflation differentials across individual euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.0,0)">In the presence of large and persistent dispersion in inflation rates across countries, an inflation objective too close to zero would imply that countries with below average inflation have to systematically operate under deflation – even if average inflation rates for the euro area were in positive territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The second element is that our definition of price stability applies over the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.04,0)">In other words, the policy-relevant horizon is a choice variable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But the choice of the extension of the horizon is conditional on the nature of the shocks shaping the inflation and economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Let me explain how that flexibility guides our policy response to different shocks in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">If the shock that moves inflation at a certain point in time comes from demand forces, our strategy postulates a monetary policy response that brings inflation back, within the range of values that define price stability, to its focal point over a relatively short horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">“Short” means here: in line with the minimum time period that monetary policy actions typically take to transmit their impulse to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">This way, inflation expectations are kept anchored and a stable path of the economy toward the new equilibrium is ensured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.25,0)">If the underlying shocks are on the supply side, there might not be an immediate cause for action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The medium term in this case may be stretched beyond the canonical minimum transmission lag and thus provides for an in-built mechanism to see through temporary supply shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Crucially, this applies only to the extent that you are reassured that long-term inflation expectations remain well anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.56,0)">Therefore, once it transpires that the supply shock is likely to be of a permanent nature because it is passed through to price and wage setting behaviour, the ECB would act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">But the flexibility in the policy-relevant time horizon grants it sufficient time to identify whether the shock is transitory or permanent before changing course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">This, in turn, allows for a steady-hand approach to our monetary policy that avoids undue policy-induced economic fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Third, adding to the flexibility deriving from the price stability definition and the variable policy horizon, the ECB has large scope in adopting further tailored measures to address specific market impairments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In this context, deliberations on enhancing the provision of credit in the economy take particular prominence in our current strategy process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">So, let me move to the issue of credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The attribute of credibility is even more important than flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">In fact, credibility is a precondition for a central bank to be able to act flexibly without unhinging market expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The extent and success of central bank intervention to stabilise the economy hinges on the credibility of their monetary policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Higher-order constraints – an institutional discipline – make the conduct of policy – a lower-order activity – both more flexible and effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.24,0)">This is due to the following reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">If market participants are confident that the central bank – in line with its mandate – is determined to offset price pressures, they will immediately factor this into their economic decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.9,0)">Hence, the mere prospects of future central bank accommodation will induce consumers and firms to shift consumption and investment decisions across time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">For instance, in a slump consumers and firms anticipate additional accommodation in the future, thus frontloading consumption and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.18,0)">Vice versa, in an overheating phase, consumers and firms restrain current spending to prepare for a more constrained monetary policy environment in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In both cases, the reliable anticipation of the future central bank response mitigates the fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In other words, central bank credibility acts as an automatic stabiliser by inducing inter-temporal substitution in economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">All that’s needed is a clear and credible commitment by the central bank to a certain course of action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">But how can we establish such commitment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The answer is: through an institutional framework that makes the central bank predictable and that protects it from the temptation to leave the path prescribed by its objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">This rationale lies at the heart of forceful safeguards to the ECB’s monetary policy independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">These safeguards ensure that our decisions are not contaminated by considerations other than those deriving from our price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.79,0)">This is the backdrop, against which I interpret the monetary financing prohibition, which bans central bank direct lending to fiscal authorities: engaging in such direct lending to governments jeopardises a central bank’s capacity to act independently and with the sole focus on monetary policy objectives; the loss of independence and focus, in turn, jeopardises central bank credibility; and the loss of central bank credibility jeopardises macroeconomic performance as it contravenes automatic stabilisation induced by private sector expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The monetary financing prohibition in the ECB’s legal framework plays an essential role in fostering central bank instrument independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.14,0)">It is not simply a constraint on what the ECB can do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">It is also a safeguard that reinforces our action and protects our capability to act in pursuit of our objective, when such action becomes necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is a catalyst of credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">And building on the credibility arising from independence, the ECB is therefore well-placed to forcefully and flexibly confront any risks to the economy without unanchoring expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">It is within the frame laid down by the Treaty that we can confidently say that the ECB will act decisively to preserve price stability and – subject to that condition – minimise wasteful fluctuations in activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">I would like to thank Fédéric Holm-Hadulla and Massimo Rostagno for their contribution to preparing this
