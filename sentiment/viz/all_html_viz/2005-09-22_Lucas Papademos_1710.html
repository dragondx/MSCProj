    <h2> Speech by Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the ECB, at the General Assembly of the German-Hellenic Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Athens, 22 September 2005 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Lucas Papademos </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)"> Growth and competitiveness in euro area economies Speech by Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the ECB,at the General Assembly of the German-Hellenic Chamber of Industry and Commerce, Athens, 22 September 2005 Check against delivery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Introduction It is a great pleasure for me to address the General Assembly of the German-Hellenic Chamber of Industry and Commerce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Over the years, the activities of the Chamber and its members have greatly contributed to the development of economic and financial ties between Germany and Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As early as the 18th century, Montesquieu observed that “two nations who traffic with each other become reciprocally dependent; for if one has an interest in buying, the other has an interest in selling; and thus their union is founded on mutual necessities”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The economic links between Germany and Greece have traditionally been strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">They can be expected to strengthen further as a result of the increasing integration of all markets in the European Union and as a consequence of the unique and irreversible connection between the economies of the two countries implied by their common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Trade, investment and financial transactions between countries foster growth and prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Clearly, however, the overall economic performance of the German and Greek economies will in the future also depend crucially on the evolution of the economic environment within which they operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">This environment has been undergoing rapid and profound changes as a result of technological advances and the globalisation of markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.79,0)">Moreover, in Europe, the gradual completion of the internal market, the enlargement of the European Union and the introduction of the European single currency have further intensified competition; these factors have also fundamentally influenced monetary and financial conditions and imposed constraints on national economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Technological advances, market globalisation and European integration are transforming the environment within which our economies function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">And they not only offer opportunities, but also pose challenges for the euro area economy and the individual Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This observation is not new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">To say that the rapidly evolving economic environment provides opportunities and poses challenges may sound somewhat clichéd.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But this does not make it less true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Indeed, I believe that it is more valid than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Therefore, the growth and prosperity of the European economies depend on their ability to effectively address the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">This requires that we establish internally conditions and institutions that foster growth and adopt policies and market practices that allow our economies to successfully compete in the global market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This brings me to the general issues I would like to address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">How can we strengthen the internal sources and forces of growth in the euro area and the individual Member States?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">And how can we simultaneously enhance their international competitiveness?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">What are the necessary conditions and key policies that can effectively foster stronger sustainable growth in the euro area in the increasingly competitive global environment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The answers to these questions have aspects that pertain to the euro area as a whole and to the individual Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">These aspects, of course, overlap and are interconnected, as the euro area economies are highly integrated and function under certain constraints imposed by the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.04,0)">These constraints seem not to be fully understood or sufficiently appreciated by all market participants, social partners and economic authorities in some euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">In discussing the two broad issues of growth and competitiveness in the euro area, I will also address a number of specific questions concerning the economic performance of the countries of the European monetary union: Have the economies of the 12 euro area countries converged sufficiently to thrive under the European single monetary policy, which is geared towards the maintenance of price stability in the euro area as a whole?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.55,0)">Are the observed divergences in growth, inflation and competitiveness across the euro area unusually large?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.35,0)">Are they a cause for concern?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.7,0)">What are the main determinants of the relative growth performance of individual Member States?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.24,0)">Are these divergences likely to be temporary or are they likely to persist?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">What can be done to reduce these divergences in the direction of price stability and higher sustainable growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.35,0)">Conditions and policies for higher euro area growth It is no secret that the growth performance of the euro area has not been satisfactory and has repeatedly proved to be below our expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">From the mid-1990s in particular the annual growth rate in the 12 euro area countries averaged 2.1%  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">During the six-year period following the introduction of the euro  , real GDP in the euro area grew on average by slightly less, namely 1.9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.24,0)">More recently, the recovery in economic activity following the trough reached in 2001 has been moderate and hesitant at times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.52,0)">This disappointing performance reflects the combined influence of several factors and shocks that, on the one hand, have adversely affected aggregate demand and, on the other hand, have constrained the expansion of aggregate supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Taking a long-term perspective, the determinants of potential output define an economy’s trend growth performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Various studies have estimated that potential growth in the euro area is within a range of 2% to 2.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">And some suggest that the lower limit of the estimated range of potential growth rates is a more realistic and relevant figure, given demographic trends and prevailing market structures and practices, and under the presumption of unchanged economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.51,0)">What are the fundamental causes of this unsatisfactory low trend growth in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The answers can be found by looking at the factors that determine potential or long-term economic growth: demographic trends, productivity growth and the degree of labour utilisation in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.71,0)">The latter concept – the extent to which the labour potentially available in the economy is effectively utilised – depends in turn on the share of the working age population that enters the labour force  , the percentage of the labour force that is employed and the average number of hours worked by each person.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.91,0)">Europe’s long-term growth performance has been constrained by:   the low rate of increase of its population and the ageing of its society;   the deceleration of labour productivity growth since the mid-1990s, despite the fact that the level of labour productivity per hour is still very high in a number of countries; and   a low degree of labour utilisation  , despite some improvement in the utilisation of labour in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.22,0)">I do not want to go into detail, but let me give you a few facts that help illustrate why growth in Europe is so subdued, especially when compared with the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Over the past decade, Europe’s population has been growing at a rate of just 0.3% per year; the United States’ population has been growing at a rate of 1.3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Productivity growth in the United States is between 0.5 and 1 percentage point higher than on this side of the Atlantic, depending on the sector of the economy and the period chosen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.76,0)">Only around 70% of Europeans of working age participate in the labour market – compared with over 80% of Americans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Unemployment in the euro area is almost 9%, three percentage points higher than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.47,0)">Moreover, those who are employed work fewer hours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.0,0)">Europeans work, on average, around 300 hours less per year than Americans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">These facts reflect the influence of a variety of factors affecting the demand for and supply of labour and the ability of the European economy to further increase the efficiency with which goods and services are produced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.58,0)">It has been argued by a number of economists that some of these facts simply reflect a preference on the part of Europeans for more leisure time, rather than seeking additional income – in other words, that Europeans rather enjoy la dolce vita, while Protestant work ethics and a more materialistic attitude to life drive Americans to work harder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.1,0)">That may be an appealing explanation, but things are more complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For example, the incentives for companies to hire staff and for people to take up work are also influenced by tax and benefit policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.47,0)">More generally, productivity growth and the functioning of labour markets are affected by a host of   factors – institutions, regulations, traditions, preferences – which can be influenced, or even radically changed, by appropriate policies and reforms that can help to boost productivity growth and employment creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Supply-side reforms are undoubtedly of crucial importance for enhancing the long-term growth prospects and the competitiveness of the European economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And I will elaborate on such reforms later in my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">What should be stressed in parallel is that the maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environment is also essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">This is a necessary condition for sustained growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The European single monetary policy has as its primary objective the preservation of price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">To achieve this objective, the ECB aims to maintain inflation at a rate close to but below 2% over the medium term for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">During the six years   following the introduction of the euro, annual inflation in the euro area averaged 2%, so the ECB has succeeded in maintaining a high degree of price stability in an unfavourable environment characterised by many adverse inflationary shocks, including the continuous and substantial increase in oil prices over the last two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">More importantly, the credibility of the stability-oriented monetary policy has anchored long-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability and this has helped to maintain bond yields at historically low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Indeed, the very low level of interest rates across the entire maturity spectrum has provided considerable and continuous support to economic growth over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Output growth differentials in the euro area countries So far, I have only talked about Europe or the euro area as a whole – as, indeed, I should, as a representative of a supranational European institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Naturally, the aggregate data for the euro area disguise certain differences that exist between individual euro area countries as regards their growth and inflation performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.0,0)">Much has been said and written about the sluggish growth in the large economies at the core of Europe, contrasting them with the “tiger economies” on the fringes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">However, a careful look at the data shows that the differences in growth rates are not exceptionally large and have not increased in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.05,0)">The dispersion of annual real GDP growth rates across euro area countries since the introduction of the euro is no greater than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It is more or less the same as it was 30 years ago – around 2 percentage points on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.9,0)">Indeed, contrary to some perceptions, the dispersion of annual growth rates has declined somewhat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">It is also interesting to note that growth differentials across the euro area countries do not seem to be significantly different to those observed across regions or states within the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Of course, real GDP growth has a cyclical and a trend component, and our analysis shows that the cyclical component has had a relatively limited influence on growth dispersion since the early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">This indicates that the observed dispersion can be largely explained by differences in trend output growth, which are relatively long-lasting – hence the fairly stable profile of growth dispersion in the last few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.01,0)">These differences in trend output growth rates might reflect structural factors, including reforms implemented in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Differences in trend growth caused by structural factors may, at least in part, reflect demographic trends or normal and healthy catching-up processes in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.82,0)">Such growth differentials should not be a cause for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Catching-up processes seem to have been underway in Spain, Greece and Ireland for several years, and output growth in these countries has persistently exceeded the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In terms of cumulated GDP per capita, these countries have since 1999 grown much faster than the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.17,0)">However, growth differentials may indeed be a cause for concern if they reflect rigidities and inefficiencies in product and labour markets resulting from insufficient structural reforms, or if they are caused by losses in competitiveness in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.29,0)">Since the mid-1990s Germany and Italy have persistently been growing at rates below the average observed across the rest of the euro area, which might reflect some long-lasting structural problems in these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.14,0)">In Germany, a rigid labour market with low employment growth has prevented a pick-up in domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.34,0)">In the case of Italy, a strong deterioration in its price and non-price competitiveness in the context of increasing competition from the new EU Member States and from non-EU countries  , may have dampened real activity, particularly real exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This observation leads me to the next issue I would like to address: divergence across euro area countries in terms of competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Competitiveness of the euro area countries Competitiveness developments are of crucial importance to the real economy, and to real export performance in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.06,0)">Price competitiveness is a somewhat complex concept to define because it involves several elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">First of all, nominal exchange rate developments play a key role in determining the price of euro area exports abroad, expressed in foreign currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But the nominal exchange rate is not, of course, the only determinant of price competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The fact that there is a single euro exchange rate for all euro area countries is the very essence of a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.43,0)">This means that a period of exchange rate depreciation or appreciation represents a common shock for all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.26,0)">However, countries do not all cope with this shock in the same way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.05,0)">During a period of euro appreciation, euro area exporters try to lower their prices in euro terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">But the individual euro area countries have not all been equally successful in lowering their export prices in euro terms and thus maintaining their export performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.69,0)">For instance, whereas German exporters have managed to significantly reduce their export prices in euro – thus staying competitive and maintaining or even expanding their market shares – Italian and Greek exporters have been less successful in reducing their export prices, partly as a result of domestic cost pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The differences in the evolution of domestic costs per unit produced has been a key factor helping German real exports to rise far more rapidly than Greek and Italian real exports over this period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.63,0)">Thus, some countries have been unable to respond in a competitive manner to external challenges, partly as a result of product and labour market rigidities that have prevented swift and adequate adjustments to relative wages and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Needless to say, the international competitiveness of an economy is a broader concept than price competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It depends on the range and quality of the goods and services a country can produce and export and, correspondingly, on the way markets, institutions and policies support and promote the other aspects of the competitiveness of the country’s products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.61,0)">Nevertheless, the export performance of the euro area countries does depend on price competitiveness, which can be substantially affected by the cumulative differences in inflation and cost developments across euro area countries over a period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">V. Inflation and cost differentials across the euro area countries Looking at the evolution of inflation rates across euro area countries over time, we observe a remarkable convergence since the early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.7,0)">Specifically, inflation dispersion across the 12 euro area countries declined substantially, by around 5%, between the early 1990s and 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Since the start of Economic and Monetary Union in 1999, inflation differentials have remained fairly stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.67,0)">A measure of dispersion, the unweighted standard deviation of inflation differentials from the average euro area inflation rate has oscillated around 1 percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.37,0)">Moreover, inflation dispersion within the euro area since the launch of the single currency is no greater than in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">It is also no greater than among regions within individual euro area countries, such as Germany and Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What is distinctive about the euro area is the fact that these differences in inflation rates are more persistent than elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.29,0)">By persistent, I mean that in some euro area countries inflation is systematically either above or below the average inflation rate in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In no less than six out of the twelve euro area countries, we have seen such persistence in differentials since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.4,0)">Specifically, inflation has, over this period, persistently been above the euro area average in Ireland, Spain, Portugal and Greece and below the average in Germany and Austria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.53,0)">What are the reasons for different inflation rates in different euro area countries, and why have they not converged  , now that we have a single currency and a single monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.99,0)">The reasons are manifold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Some inflation differentials are simply a normal and even desirable feature of a monetary union that help to correct country-specific imbalances when national monetary and exchange rate policies are no longer available options.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.38,0)">Such inflation differentials may reflect, inter alia, adjustments to shocks or catching-up processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.08,0)">National fiscal policies, resulting in different changes to indirect taxes or administrative prices, also seem to explain part of the inflation differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.55,0)">Even though some of these factors have indeed contributed to the persistence of inflation differentials, they should not automatically be considered a cause for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.1,0)">However, other factors, such as rigidities in price-setting mechanisms or excessive wage developments, leading to strong rises in unit labour costs in some countries, may give rise to inflation differentials that could be of concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.47,0)">These factors may delay the necessary adjustment of relative prices to economic shocks and amplify fluctuations of the business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">According to recent research by the ECB, domestic factors, such as diverging unit labour costs, seem to be of key importance in explaining overall inflation differentials within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.79,0)">Let me therefore elaborate further on developments in unit labour costs across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Unit labour cost increases reflect wage developments relative to productivity gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.2,0)">Since the introduction of the euro, unit labour cost developments have, indeed, differed markedly across the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.96,0)">During this period the cumulative increase in unit labour costs has in some euro area countries, such as Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal, been significantly higher than the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.74,0)">As mentioned before, these are also economies where inflation has been persistently above the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.83,0)">On the other hand, countries such as Germany and Austria are among those with very limited cumulative unit labour cost increases over the same period, and inflation in these countries has been lower than in the rest of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.39,0)">When discussing these facts we should keep in mind that unit labour cost developments in the economy as a whole can mask different developments across sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.21,0)">For instance, looking only at the manufacturing industry – which constitutes, on average, around 20% of the whole economy – unit labour cost developments seem much more benign than is the case for the economy as a whole in many countries, including Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This, of course, implies that unit labour cost growth is stronger in the non-manufacturing sector of the economy, especially in the services sector, which is less exposed to international competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This seems to confirm that inflation differentials are primarily explained by domestic cost factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.51,0)">Decomposing the cumulative change in unit labour costs for the whole economy over the period 1999-2004 shows that cross-country differentials appear to stem primarily from differences in developments in compensation per employee across countries, while changes in labour productivity have been more homogeneous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">With a single currency, cost developments in individual countries, as captured by unit labour costs, play a key role in determining changes in competitiveness across the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.65,0)">If a country’s unit labour costs persistently rise by more than the euro area average, this will obviously have a negative impact on its competitiveness vis-à-vis the other euro area countries as well as vis-à-vis other   countries that are competitors in world markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Remaining competitive by favourably influencing domestic cost developments is, therefore, crucially important for economic activity and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is not the only way, but it is an essential way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I have so far spent a fair amount of time trying to explain the causes and implications of growth, inflation and competitiveness differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.21,0)">After all this analysis, it is time to ask: What are we going to do about it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.46,0)">What is the message?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.39,0)">During the Cold War, a US Secretary of State once described a warning message sent to the Russians, rather paradoxically, as “a calculated ambiguity that would be clearly understood”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">My message today contains no ambiguity, and I would like it to be clearly understood: higher long-term growth and improved competitiveness for the euro area and its member countries are urgently needed and are indeed possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">The way to achieve them is through the determined implementation of the necessary structural reforms in an environment of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.57,0)">VI.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Structural reforms for higher   growth and improved competitiveness This message about the urgent need for structural reforms has been repeated time and again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">And by now there is indeed a large consensus in Europe about the kind of remedies that are needed to bring European economies on a sustainably higher growth path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The Lisbon agenda, as recently refined and refocused – and endorsed by all 25 EU Member States – is evidence of this broad support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The next urgent step is to focus on implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We have to move from recognising what is necessary to doing what is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.04,0)">There is not enough time for me to address the appropriate structural reforms in detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">However, let me just briefly mention a few areas in labour and product markets where I think that further progress is most urgently needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Structural reforms are crucial in labour markets so as to make them more flexible and adaptable, to support the creation of new jobs and to increase labour utilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.62,0)">Employment protection legislation and wage-setting mechanisms, including wage indexation, also need to be reviewed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">A sufficient degree of wage differentiation is important to ensure that wage adjustments closely reflect differences in regional and sectoral productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">At the same time, labour market policies should go hand in hand with structural reforms resulting in enhanced competition in goods and services markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">This in turn requires measures aimed at increasing the number of potential players in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">There are significant productivity gains to be reaped in Europe by removing the considerable barriers to competition that still remain at the national and EU levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Further efforts should therefore be made to reduce firms’ entry costs, such as the administrative burden on start-ups, and – more generally – to reduce red tape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">In this context, specific emphasis should be placed on enhancing competition within and across our economies by liberalising trade in services – which account for almost seven out of ten jobs in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Ensuring an institutional environment that encourages business creation and expansion should therefore be among our priorities, together with supporting innovation and the diffusion of technological progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">In order to successfully harness technological advancements – and thus to compete in world markets on the basis of superior quality and scientific and technological edge – a continuous improvement in human capital is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">As economic activity becomes increasingly knowledge-based and jobs shift from low to high-skilled workers through the process of Schumpeterian “creative destruction”, sustained investment in education and in research and development becomes indispensable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.49,0)">To plead for all this is not “to dream the impossible dream”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">That it can be done successfully is shown in the Nordic countries, which have undergone such structural reforms in the past decade – and have done so without abandoning the basic features of what we call the European social model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">These countries are now reaping the benefits of these reforms in terms of growth, employment and technological excellence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">We should seek to learn from each other, to analyse what works and what does not, and to adapt suitable policies to local conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.43,0)">In so doing, we should avoid unnecessary regulation or bureaucratic procedures that might be well-meant, but end up stifling growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In these efforts to enhance the growth performance of the European economies, fiscal policy plays a crucial role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Sound fiscal policies are not only necessary to support the stability-oriented single monetary policy; healthy public finances are a key element in shoring up the confidence of investors, businesses and consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Moreover, public expenditure should aim to deliver efficient and competitive public services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">A reformed public sector can also play an important role as a catalyst in stimulating the restructuring of the private sector, eliminating rigidities and dismantling structures that impede competition, efficiency and the adaptability of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Finally, fiscal policy should not only aim to reduce the fiscal burden, but also give due regard to the “quality of public finances”, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.16,0)">the structure of public expenditure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.01,0)">VII.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Conclusions There are plenty of challenges ahead in seeking to cope with the impact of globalisation and technological change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.31,0)">Not just for the euro area as a whole, but also for its individual member countries – especially those whose level of international competitiveness is relatively low and which may have been adversely affected in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">While Monetary Union in Europe has been an effective – and hugely successful – response to globalisation for the euro area countries, it has also placed those countries under a specific constraint – that there is only one single monetary policy, geared towards price stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">That said, we already have the tools in our hands to address these challenges: the Lisbon strategy, as refocused and reaffirmed by the European Council this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The tasks ahead of us are demanding, but I am optimistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">After all, we can all remember the jubilations of last summer, when “Lisbon” acquired a very special and positive connotation in Greece: as an impressive joint effort that was crowned by an overwhelming success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">During the ten years before the introduction of the single currency, this measure of dispersion stood at around 2.9 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Compared with the differences in inflation rates among the 14 US metropolitan statistical areas typically used to measure such phenomena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.86,0)">When comparing inflation dispersion within the euro area with that within individual countries, we need to be cautious for various reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.75,0)">For instance, the methods used to calculate these differences or the definition of the number and size of the geographical regions within a Member State may differ.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.69,0)">61-78</span>
