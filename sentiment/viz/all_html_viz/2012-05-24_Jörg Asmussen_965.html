    <h3> Speaker: Jörg Asmussen </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)"> An ECB perspective on key issues of the crisis Speech by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, European Financial CongressSopot, Poland, 24 May 2012 Dear ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here with you at the European Financial Congress in Sopot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It would have been nice to visit Poland two weeks from now for the opening game of the UEFA Euro 2012!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">However, I did have the chance to spend 30 minutes this afternoon at Sopot’s boardwalk and I very much enjoyed the Baltic Sea and the Polish coast after spending another long night in Brussels yesterday at the informal European Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">In my view, the European Council delivered two strong messages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">First, it confirmed the euro area’s commitment to a long-term vision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The final destination is clear: a deepened economic union which manifests the partial political union our currency de facto already represents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The most important outcome of last night is that leaders showed their commitment to move the economic and monetary union to a new stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Second, all EU leaders agree that growth-enhancing measures and efforts to achieve sustainable public finances need to go hand in hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I would like to structure my remarks around three claims.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These are claims that I have come across more than once.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">They express understandable concerns and relate to key issues of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.97,0)">“Policy-makers are obsessed with austerity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.0,0)">They ignore the need for growth in Europe.” “The ECB is moving on very thin ice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Its actions increase inflationary risks in the euro area.” “The current crisis management is all about quick fixes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.14,0)">There is no medium or long term strategy.” “Policy-makers are obsessed with austerity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">They ignore the need for growth in Europe.” Austerity versus growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.31,0)">This debate is wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.4,0)">Policy-makers are often accused of being obsessed with fiscal austerity and ignoring the need for growth in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.98,0)">Let me be clear: fiscal consolidation is not an end in itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Rather, it is a pre-condition for achieving sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Fiscal consolidation creates the confidence that investors and consumers need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Ultimately, it supports both economic growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The only alternative would be to fight debt with more debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.6,0)">This is no solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Improvements on the fiscal front are becoming visible in the data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.37,0)">The euro area public deficit declined to 4.1% of GDP in 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.56,0)">It is expected to fall to 3.2% in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.27,0)">The French deficit, for instance, came in at 5.2% of GDP in 2011, 0.5 percentage points below the government’s target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">I expect France to continue on this path and to achieve the 3% deficit target in 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">But while fiscal consolidation is a necessary pre-condition for sustainable growth, it is not sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.5,0)">So the debate is not about austerity versus growth, instead it is about austerity and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We need both.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.24,0)">No one is against growth, but growth cannot be achieved by spending programmes which fuel the economy for a quarter or two but are no more than a flash in the pan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The important thing is to find ways to increase the growth potential, and this is far more challenging than introducing popular but short-sighted initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">From my perspective, a growth package should have three components i) reforms in product and services markets ii) reforms in labour markets iii) funding of growth initiatives As regards reforms in services markets, for example, policy instruments that could help to boost growth already exist at the EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The Services Directive was adopted in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, it has not yet been fully implemented in all Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Nine out of ten new jobs in the EU are created in the services sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.32,0)">Yet cross-border provision of services in the EU remains difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">While 70% of the EU’s GDP is generated in services, only 20% of services are provided cross-border.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Up to 1.8% in additional growth could be unleashed for the EU with the full implementation of the Services Directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The June European Council will adopt measures to make sure that the growth-enhancing potential of the Services Directive is fully exploited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In labour markets, we see that Member States have started to implement important structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Spain is increasing the flexibility of employment contracts and addressing the problem of the country’s ‘dual labour market’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Here in Poland, the increase in the retirement age to 67 is a good example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.71,0)">It illustrates the fact that implementing structural reforms can be painful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">But this pain should pay off in the future, as we have seen in Germany with the “Agenda 2010” labour market reforms implemented from 2003 to 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Germany is now profiting significantly from these reforms now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">A key factor in labour market reforms is mobility – particularly in the euro area, but also at the level of the EU 27.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.77,0)">The restrictions on the free movement of workers from eastern Europe after the EU enlargement of 2004 will be gradually phased out; they no longer apply to Poland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Enhanced procedures in the cross-border recognition of higher education diplomas, easing the issue of pension transfers and a better networking of job agencies across Europe come immediately to mind as ways to further increase the mobility of workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As I said, a growth package should not be confused with the idea of large-scale spending programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Nevertheless, growth-enhancing measures will not come for free in each case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For the funding, financial instruments of the European Investment Bank   could be used, for example project bonds to support infrastructure projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">More generally, funds from the EU budget should be redirected to areas where the money is really needed and where its impact would be greatest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.93,0)">Member States have to move away from „juste retour” thinking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.49,0)">“The ECB is moving on very thin ice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Its actions increase inflationary risks in the euro area.” Let me now address the recent action taken by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In particular, I would like to focus on the two three-year longer-term refinancing operations   that we conducted in December 2011 and February 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.69,0)">Any assessment of the impact of the LTROs on the real economy would be premature at this stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.81,0)">It is true that bank lending to the private sector is still very much subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">But the data up to March confirm that the LTROs have reduced deleveraging pressures for banks and helped to avoid a major credit crunch in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.34,0)">A number of questions have been raised about these operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.3,0)">The most important concern is that the LTROs increase inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">A large injection of central bank liquidity could, in principle, give rise to inflationary risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Inflationary risks would increase if a massive rise in firms’ demand for credit was met by an equally massive increase in banks’ capacity and willingness to supply credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.59,0)">These conditions are clearly not met at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">As with all other measures the ECB has taken, the LTROs are fully in line with our guiding principle: the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">We constantly monitor the developments of credit and money in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">If inflationary risks were to emerge, we would take the necessary action to prevent these risks from materialising and withdraw any excess liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.5,0)">When we measure monetary liquidity, we do not look at the balance sheet of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">We look at the balance sheet of the euro area banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Only the latter shows the interaction with the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.65,0)">And it tells us that the growth of money and credit remains very subdued, despite a recent stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">There is no reason to question our commitment to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">According to the most recent ECB Survey of Professional Forecasters  , euro area inflation is expected to rise to 2.3% in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.62,0)">But it will fall thereafter and remain close to or slightly below 2% for the foreseeable future  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">As regards the collateral framework that has been adopted by some national central banks to give banks access to the liquidity of the three-year LTROs, let me just say the following: appropriate haircuts, often very high, are applied to all credit claims provided as collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.02,0)">Any discretion on the part of national central banks is limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The ECB constantly monitors all related risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">“The current crisis management is all about quick fixes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.86,0)">There is no medium or long term strategy.” This leads me to the third and last part of what I would like to say.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In the current crisis management, the ECB has a prominent role, more prominently than I would actually like.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But the bulk of the responsibility for resolving this crisis lies with national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">I have mentioned the need for fiscal consolidation and structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">But more is being done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.59,0)">To many observers the crisis management looks very much like “muddling through”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.99,0)">This is only half true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In addition to the day-to-day crisis fighting, a number of far-reaching decisions have been taken at the European level, some under the Polish Presidency last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.54,0)">These decisions are more than just quick fixes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">They should help to improve the functioning of the Monetary Union in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Strong firewalls have been created.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.49,0)">In July 2012, the European Financial Stability Facility will be replaced by a permanent safety net, the European Stability Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The ESM will have a robust capital structure and flexible crisis intervention tools at hand to mitigate contagion risks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Overall, the euro area is mobilising a firewall of about EUR 800 billion, or more than USD 1 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The EU’s fiscal regime, the Stability and Growth Pact, has been strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">25 EU Member States have signed the fiscal compact, which commits countries to enshrining important fiscal rules in binding national legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The fiscal compact is an important step towards a fiscal union in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Its timely ratification is now key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">A real innovation is the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">It will help to detect and correct economic imbalances, for instance in house price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.48,0)">This should avoid situations like in Ireland, where a bursting housing bubble, together with bank guarantees provided by the state, led to an abrupt fiscal deterioration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">More legislative acts are under way to further increase the surveillance of national economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Once the “two-pack” has been adopted, it will be possible for draft national budgets to be examined in Brussels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.26,0)">And revisions will be demanded if the budgets are not in line with the euro area’s fiscal rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">If implemented successfully, these measures will help countries to internalise an important point: any member of a currency union has to treat its economic policies as a matter of common concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The euro area is already much closer to a political union than many of us realise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.3,0)">There is one broad area, however, where a good strategy is still missing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.06,0)">This is the area of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.7,0)">Let me mention just one concern which needs to be addressed: the negative feedback loops between banks and national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.06,0)">The recapitalisation of a troubled bank by its government may lead to a deterioration of the government’s fiscal position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.13,0)">The deteriorating fiscal position in turn further weakens banks’ balance sheets, through their holdings of sovereign bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.78,0)">This feedback loop has to be stopped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">We have to move closer to a financial markets’ union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">A European bank resolution authority and a European deposit insurance scheme are two elements that could be used to address the nexus between sovereigns and banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.25,0)">I see further issues that need to be addressed in the area of financial markets, for example the potential conflict of interest for national supervisors whose task should be to ensure financial stability and a smooth functioning of European financial markets, but who are – at the end of the day – accountable to a national parliament and the tax payers of one single country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This, from my point of view, is an argument in favour of the single European rulebook without loop- holes and a supervisory authority at the European level for systemically relevant financial institutions with a cross-border business model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Concluding remarks Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The crisis in Europe is still ongoing, but we have come a long way in addressing the most important issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">It is important for the euro area to continue on its reform path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This is difficult but indispensable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.39,0)">I am aware that here in Poland, people view the euro area’s crisis management with some scepticism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.0,0)">They fear a division of the EU into two blocs: the euro area and the rest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.2,0)">The creation of a dividing line is certainly not our goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The Single Market binds all 27 EU Member States closely together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This level playing field has to be preserved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.83,0)">But the crisis has shown that the economies inside the euro area are even more intertwined than those outside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Therefore, reforms have to be more ambitious and rules stricter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This does not mean that those outside the euro area are excluded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">As you are well aware, Poland, for instance, has signed the Euro Plus Pact and the fiscal compact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And the euro area is not a closed club: it is open to every EU Member State that fulfils the convergence criteria on a sustainable basis.</span>
