    <span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)"> Introductory statement to the plenary debate of the European Parliament on the ECB’s Annual Report 2013 Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Brussels, 25 February 2015 Mr Vice-President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Honourable Members of Parliament, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am very pleased to participate in this plenary debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">To lay the ground for our discussion, I would like to discuss three topics: the ECB’s monetary policy, focussing on the rationale for our latest monetary policy measures, the ECB’s commitment to accountability and transparency, and the progress towards building a deeper economic and monetary union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I will thereby address most of the issues which the ECON Committee highlighted in its draft resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.24,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy For several quarters now, inflation in the euro area has been on a continuous downward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">At the same time, in January 2015 market participants were expecting inflation to return to levels closer to our policy aim only over a horizon which stretched well beyond any meaningful definition of medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.86,0)">In an environment of weak economic recovery and subdued money and credit developments, risks were increasing that falling inflation expectations would feed back into weakening actual inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.8,0)">Such a self-reinforcing process could have posed severe downside risks to our price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.0,0)">Against this background, we judged that the degree of monetary accommodation that had been introduced in 2014 was insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">A more forceful monetary policy response became necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">With key interest rates at their lower bound, the Governing Council of the ECB considered outright purchases of public securities to be the only remaining instrument which could be activated on a sufficient scale to broaden and strengthen the measures already in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Thus, we decided in January to launch an expanded asset purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Under the programme the Eurosystem will continue its purchases of simple and transparent asset-backed securities and of covered bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In addition, we will start purchasing on the secondary market investment-grade securities issued by euro area governments, public agencies and European institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The purchases will start in March.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The combined purchases of public and private sector securities will amount to €60 billion per month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The programme is intended to last until end-September 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">In any case, it will last until the Governing Council sees a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation which is consistent with its aim of achieving inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">As in the case of the existing purchases of private sector securities, the purchases of public securities have a high transmission potential to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">They will further support a broad based easing of financial conditions in the euro area, including those relevant for the borrowing conditions of euro area firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In fact, we have already seen some positive effects of our measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Financial conditions in money and bond markets throughout the euro area have eased further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.02,0)">Accordingly, lending rates to households and firms have come down considerably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Loan dynamics have continued to recover, with the growth in credit to the private sector turning positive in December for the first time since mid-2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Also, evidence from the recent January 2015 Bank Lending Survey provides positive signals, showing a further improvement in credit standards for all loan categories in the fourth quarter of 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Moreover, most recently, we have also seen a measurable improvement in indicators of business and consumer confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Overall, our measures will support economic activity, underpin the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, and contribute to a sustained return of inflation towards a level below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The ECB’s commitment to accountability and transparency Today’s session is also an opportunity to take a wider perspective on ECB policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In that context, let me touch upon a topic that is of high relevance to you: the ECB’s accountability and transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Accountability of the central bank is the essential counterpart to its independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">To this end, the ECB has an elaborate framework to discharge accountability to European citizens and your house, and today’s debate is a key element of this framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Taking up new tasks in the supervisory field required adding further elements to this framework, and I believe the first months of operation of the SSM have proven our commitment to accountability in this domain as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But accountability would not be meaningful without an appropriate degree of transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">From the start, due also to its unique institutional set-up, the ECB has strived to be transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For instance, we were the first major central bank to hold a regular press conference immediately after our policy meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.66,0)">The ECB also regularly publishes a variety of data on the execution of its monetary policy operations and the liquidity conditions of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">More recently, we have decided to go one step further and to publish regular accounts of Governing Council monetary policy discussions, starting with the meeting on 21-22 January 2015, the account of which was published last Thursday..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Through these accounts, we are enriching the communication of the rationale behind our monetary policy decisions and seek to give a sense of the discussion that has taken place among Governing Council members and the main arguments that were exchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">We believe that this will enable members of the public and markets to improve their understanding of our assessment of the economy and our policy responses in the light of evolving conditions, our so-called “reaction function”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">In the current circumstances, it will also underpin our forward guidance on interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">It will thereby further enhance the effectiveness of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The future of EMU governance The past few years have been challenging for the conduct of our monetary policy in view of the environment of financial fragmentation, which brings me to the topic of the foundation of our economic and monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">At the beginning of EMU stood a clear commitment by Member States to converge economically and institutionally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Progress has been significant when it comes to common institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">We now have not only one currency and one central bank, but also one supervisor, one resolution authority and one crisis-management mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">These institutions are built on the principles of shared sovereignty and of strong enforcement of common rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Together, these institutions clearly set the euro area apart from the arrangements that were in place prior to the start of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">But we have not yet reached the stage of a genuine EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Economic convergence has not been as sustainable as it was hoped for at the outset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">This still puts at risk the long-term success of monetary union when faced with an important shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">In my view, there are two complementary responses to address this situation: First, the economies of euro area Member States need to become more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This requires sound public finances and, in particular at the current juncture, decisive reforms of their economic structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Fully applying the strengthened economic governance framework will support this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Second, in the medium to longer term, we need to move from a system of rules and guidelines for national economic policy making to a system of further sovereignty sharing within common institutions so as to strengthen our economic policy governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">A common rule is only as strong as the common institution that can enforce it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">The discussions on the new Four Presidents’ Report will certainly provide a good opportunity to think further on these matters, and I am looking forward to your views in the upcoming Berès report on the economic governance framework.</span>
