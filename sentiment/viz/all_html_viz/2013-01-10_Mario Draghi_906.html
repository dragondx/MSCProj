    <span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)"> Unveiling of the 5 euro banknote of the new Europa series Short address by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Archaeological Museum in Frankfurt am Main, 10 January 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen, I too would like to warmly welcome you to today’s event and thank you for having accepted our invitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">In particular, I would like to thank you, Mr Wamers, for your kind words.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">I am very pleased that you have made available this special setting of the Archaeological Museum for the unveiling of the new 5 euro banknote and for the hosting of the “New Face of the Euro” exhibition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Frankfurt is one of the European Union’s financial capitals, a very international city and an important one for trade and finance in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This is one of many reasons why Frankfurt has become the City of the Euro and the seat of the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This museum, among its many treasures, displays items from classical antiquity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">So it is quite appropriate for Europa, a figure from Greek mythology, to be on show here and for us to unveil the new banknote that includes her portrait.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The 5 euro will be the first banknote of the second series of euro banknotes, the so-called “Europa” series.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It will gradually replace the first series of euro banknotes, which was introduced on 1 January 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">That’s the date most people remember – it was when the euro finally became “real” for 300 million citizens in the then 12 euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">And it was one of the milestones laid down by the founding fathers of Economic and Monetary Union in the Treaty of Maastricht more than 20 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Over the years, euro banknotes have become the most visible symbol of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The single currency, the euro, was conceived as a key step towards that goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Despite the challenges facing the euro area, progress was made in 2012 and I am confident that 2013 will bring a deepening of Economic and Monetary Union and will strengthen European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">The ECB plays a key role in bringing the countries of Europe closer together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Besides our core function and mandate to guarantee price stability in the euro area as a whole, one of our tasks is to develop what we could call “ our product”, the euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">The new series of banknotes will continue to reflect the unity and diversity of our continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The word ‘euro’ is now written in the Cyrillic as well as in the Latin and Greek alphabets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Today, 332 million people in 17 countries use euro banknotes every day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And worldwide, the value of euro banknotes circulating is roughly the same as that of US dollar bills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Last month that value was almost 913 billion euro, with around one-quarter of that value circulating outside the euro area, notably in its neighbouring regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">The euro is in fact being increasingly used as a global currency and its banknotes have been circulating inside and outside Europe with ease.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">With 15.7 billion of them in circulation, euro banknotes are a success story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">However, we do not rest on our laurels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The ECB strives to ensure that the banknotes are steadily developed and enhanced, and are “state of the art” in terms of security and technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The Europa series will be “smarter” and even more secure than the current series.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The new 5 euro banknote will be issued throughout the euro area as of 2 May this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For the next two months it will be on display here as part of the “New Face of the Euro” exhibition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The exhibition also includes the vase from which the portrait of Europa was taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">I would like to thank very much the Louvre museum in Paris for the loan of this ancient artefact, which is over 2,000 years old.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Let me also express on this occasion our thanks to Mr Gerstetter, the designer of the Europa series, who is with us today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Without further ado, let me now sign the first 5 euro note of the Europa series.</span>
