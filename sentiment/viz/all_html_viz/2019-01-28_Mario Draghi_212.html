    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)"> Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory Statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECON committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 28 January 2019 Mr Chairman, Honourable members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be back at the European Parliament and to appear before your Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">I am happy that you have chosen the euro project and its achievements over the past 20 years as the topic for our discussion today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I will start on the substance without further ado, discussing in turn the internal and external dimensions of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">I will then argue that, building on what we have already achieved, our duty today is to continue to make progress in ensuring that all of the euro’s benefits are realised in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The euro’s internal dimension The euro was introduced to deepen the Single Market and safeguard its integrity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">It continued the European project of reducing cross-border barriers through common endeavours and common policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">It followed the spirit that was already imbued in the Schuman declaration in 1950: building Europe “through concrete achievements”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">As a result, our economies are now integrated to a point that was unimaginable not so long ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The euro was designed to be a trusted and stable currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">And the euro has indeed provided two decades of price stability, thereby upholding people’s confidence in the value of their savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Stable prices also facilitated firm investment and the creation of new jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Today, there are 20 million more Europeans in employment than 20 years ago in the 19 countries that currently make up the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">And since the creation of the euro, the labour force participation rate has risen from 59% to 67%, its highest level ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">The two decades in which the euro has existed have been exceptional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The first decade was the culmination of a 30-year period of macroeconomic stability, also known as the Great Moderation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Inflation averaged close to 2% and the ECB ensured price stability mainly by adjusting its key interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.03,0)">The second decade produced the worst economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">As I had the opportunity to discuss at length in my remarks at the Parliament’s plenary debate two weeks ago, as a response to the crisis we had to deploy new instruments to safeguard the effectiveness of our monetary policy and stabilise the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Thanks to the collective efforts of all European citizens, the euro area has emerged from this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.78,0)">The results of their and their representatives’ determination have been tangible: 22 consecutive quarters of economic growth, the unemployment rate at its lowest level since October 2008, and wages and incomes on the rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.29,0)">However, over the past few months, incoming information has continued to be weaker than expected on account of softer external demand and some country and sector-specific factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.61,0)">The persistence of uncertainties in particular relating to geopolitical factors and the threat of protectionism is weighing on economic sentiment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">At the same time, supportive financing conditions, favourable labour market dynamics and rising wage growth continue to underpin the euro area expansion and gradually rising inflation pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This supports our confidence in the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Significant monetary policy stimulus remains essential to support the further build-up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">This will be provided by our forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of acquired assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">In any event, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation continues to move towards the Governing Council’s inflation aim in a sustained manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The euro’s external dimension The benefits of the euro have not been limited to the European internal dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Standing together within the Economic and Monetary Union   allowed us to retain sovereignty that would otherwise be lost by individual countries in a highly integrated world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">As already envisaged at the time of its creation, the euro symbolises the unity of a European continent that is better able to exert global influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Our togetherness in the EMU gives us “a greater say in international negotiation” and enhances our “capacity to influence economic relations” - to quote the Delors Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Over the past 20 years, the euro has become the second most important currency in the international monetary system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.58,0)">Somewhere between 20% and 40% of global foreign reserves, foreign exchange transactions, international debt and international trade transactions are denominated in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And over 50 countries or territories use or link their currency to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This global standing brings benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">For one, it lowers the transaction costs of trading internationally, making euro area firms more competitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">It also adds breadth and liquidity to euro area financial markets, allowing domestic and international investors to allocate economic resources more efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">And it lowers the cost of global capital market financing for euro area borrowers, including corporations, financial institutions and public entities, thus benefiting firms, households and taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.66,0)">Of course, the international role of the euro also brings challenges, such as greater exposure to global foreign financial developments and potential changes to the monetary policy transmission process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The international benefits of sharing a currency go beyond the monetary sphere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">In a world with deep economic and financial interlinkages, international cooperation is essential and we can more effectively promote European ideas and interests by speaking together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Indeed, the euro area’s voice has been crucial in strengthening the international financial regulatory framework after the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Today, the Single Supervisory Mechanism is the largest banking supervisor globally and successfully contributes to shaping the international supervisory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.26,0)">Since the global financial and euro area debt crises, however, the euro’s international role seems to have gradually eroded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.62,0)">While its importance as the currency of invoice for international trade transactions has remained broadly stable, its role in global foreign reserves and global debt markets has declined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.95,0)">This decline is a symptom of the fault lines in EMU exposed by the crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.09,0)">Concerns about the resilience of the EMU architecture and about financial fragmentation underpinned this erosion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Indeed, stability, financial depth and liquidity are among the key determinants of an international currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">European policymakers are now paying closer attention and various calls have been made in recent months for the euro to assume a stronger international role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The Euro Summit of December 2018 encouraged work to be taken forward to this end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The international role of the euro is supported by the pursuit of sound economic policies in the euro area and a deeper and more complete EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">And this requires further efforts along the path of deeper integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Completing the Economic and Monetary Union The past 20 years have revealed beyond doubt how challenging ensuring economic prosperity and stability can be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This was true both inside and outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Nonetheless, these years also demonstrated that such a shared challenge is best faced collectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">To realise in full the benefits of the euro, we need to have the same components that made the euro a reality in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">On the one hand, we need national reforms to promote sustainable economic convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Under any monetary system, higher growth potential can only be achieved through continuous reform efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As the convergence process is primarily driven by structural factors, this is a key responsibility of Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">On the other hand, Europe can make a difference by supporting and facilitating such reform efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Our togetherness represents a unique competitive advantage, and we should capitalise on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">First, we can build on the synergies between EMU and the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The Single Market is indeed one of the most powerful tools we have to unlock the mechanisms that will raise productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In particular, a genuine capital markets union   would not only ease and diversify access to funds for households and firms, thus fostering investment and innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">It would also enable risk diversification and thus compensate for temporary drops in activity locally - the so called private risk-sharing –, thereby reinforcing the overall resilience of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Second, it is essential to complete the projects that we initiated during the crisis, namely the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Together with CMU, a complete banking union would deliver meaningful private risk sharing that is currently lacking in the euro area in comparison to the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">But private risk sharing, to be effective, needs to be supported by other policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">We should thus rekindle trust in our economic and fiscal framework, by making it more effective in ensuring sound policy making at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">These actions can also be further supported at the European level by the recent decisions to launch an instrument for convergence and competitiveness for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">To tackle future cyclical crises, the two layers of protection against shocks – the diversification of risk through the private financial system on the one hand, and public countercyclical support through fiscal instruments at the national and European levels on the other – need to interact in a complete and efficient manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Achieving these reforms is not idealistic, nor utopian if we work together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">And at the Euro Summit in December, leaders renewed their political commitment to strengthen EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">If we want to realise in full the benefits of the euro, we need to capitalise on this commitment and translate it into concrete policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.77,0)">Conclusion Mr Chairman, Honourable members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, I have used the word “together” several times today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.11,0)">As this is the last time that we will be together in this legislative term, let me add a few words to you personally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">I would like to thank you all for the role that this Committee has played over the past years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">In my first hearing here, I remember saying that was my first exercise in democratic accountability with the European Parliament and how grateful I was for it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Many more would follow and you effectively ensured that the ECB would be accountable and therefore could legitimately be independent in carrying out its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">But I am also grateful for the support that this Committee always expressed for the actions of the ECB, a sincere support because it built on the voice of European citizens and an important support that helped the ECB through the many difficult times of the past years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">As co-legislators your role was also essential in delivering reforms that further strengthened our Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">This Committee, and the European Parliament more generally, has been in my experience an attentive interpreter of the demands of European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">It is only by doing so that the trust in the legitimacy of the EU’s institutions and policies is built, making it possible to achieve a more effective and inclusive Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">As I have argued elsewhere, citizens demand, and Parliament may help in achieving, a “more perfect Union”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">A Union that will continue providing its citizens with physical and economic security, while also promoting the values of an open, democratic and peaceful society.</span>
