    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)"> Two continents compared Keynote address by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat the “ECB and its Watchers XIII” conference Frankfurt am Main, 10 June 2011 Ladies and Gentlemen, As always, it is a pleasure for me to open this conference today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Four years ago at this gathering, I compared monetary policy in the euro area and in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Today, I would also like to talk to you on the theme of “two continents compared”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">As we are all too well aware, much has happened on both sides of the Atlantic since 2007, and it is useful to take stock again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But this time, I would like to focus less on monetary policy and more on the wider economies of the two continents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The crisis has exposed in both continents the issue of heterogeneity – a wide diversity of experience across different parts of the whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">As we will see, the economic fallout from the crisis and the ensuing recovery have shown considerable variation among the US states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And as we know, the same is true in the euro area, where some countries are a particular focus of attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But before turning to the issue of regional heterogeneity and the appropriate coordination of regional policies within an economic and monetary union  , let me briefly take a bird’s eye view of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">A bird’s eye view of the euro area Speaking here four years ago I looked back at the ECB’s monetary policy over the period 1999-2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.86,0)">I showed a scatterplot of inflation volatility and output volatility for the euro area and other advanced countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.25,0)">Academic research suggests that there might be a trade-off between these two variables and that it is therefore difficult to have low inflation volatility and low output volatility at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">But what the chart showed was that the euro area scored well on both dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.85,0)">This seemed puzzling given that the euro area has quite rigid product and labour markets, at least compared with the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The higher degree of price and wage rigidity in the euro area would suggest that output volatility should be significantly larger in the euro area than in the more flexible US economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.27,0)">This would be particularly true during a period when the economy is subject to supply-side shocks, which are exerting simultaneously inflationary and recessionary influences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Yet surprisingly, and despite the negative supply-side shocks that had been hitting the euro area economy over the years up to 2007, the data suggested that both inflation volatility and output volatility in the euro area were lower than elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.48,0)">Has the crisis changed this picture?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Obviously, output volatility in the euro area is much higher when the crisis is included in the sample.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">But, remarkably, the euro area still scores well on both dimensions compared with other advanced countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.61,0)">So what is behind this apparent puzzle?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.5,0)">How can nominal rigidities plus supply-side pressures not produce bad or worse macroeconomic outcomes?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">As I explained in detail four years ago, I believe that the strong anchoring of inflation expectations in the euro area is the key to understanding these developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Inflation expectations have remained solidly anchored in line with our definition of price stability throughout the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.92,0)">There was no materialisation of a deflation risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This has enormously facilitated our task, especially during the period of economic freefall in the winter of 2008/09.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Other indicators corroborate the finding that at the aggregate level the euro has been a remarkable success: Annual inflation over the first 12 years of EMU has been 1.97% on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">This outcome is fully in line with our aim of keeping inflation below, but close to 2% over the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">What is equally noticeable is that it is a better result, in terms of price stability, than in the euro area Member States over the last 50 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Real output per capita has grown at a similar pace in the euro area than in the United States, which – in terms of economic dynamism – remains the benchmark for the advanced countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Employment growth in the euro area has been strong over the past 12 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">More than 14 million jobs have been created since the introduction of the euro, compared with 8 million in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Finally, public finances in the euro area as a whole are sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.21,0)">As elsewhere, the financial crisis has left its mark on government deficit and debt in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.88,0)">Yet, the fiscal deficit in the euro area on aggregate for this year is estimated at less than one half of that in the United States and Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.9,0)">Recent forecasts indicate that the euro area as a whole is on track to bring the deficit to GDP ratio below the 3% reference value by 2013 and to stop the adverse debt dynamics caused by the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Of course, there is absolutely no reason for complacency in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Much more remains to be done, especially in terms of employment creation, reduction of the level of unemployment and enhancement of Europe’s growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">But, we should recognise that the euro has acted in many areas as a catalyst for structural change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">If euro area member states take up the challenge of adjusting, there is every reason to be confident about the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Heterogeneity in the euro area and the United States So much for the bird’s eye view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Let me now zoom in on the regional dimension and focus on heterogeneity within EMU compared with the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.58,0)">You may argue that the bird’s eye view is misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">The US economy may be more homogeneous than the economy of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.22,0)">In other words, aggregate economic data may hide the variance in economic performance across regions within a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.67,0)">Looking more closely at the regional dispersion across US regions and euro area economies suggests otherwise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In fact, the dispersion of many of the key indicators is similar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.11,0)">Let me start off with the inflation indicator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Before the crisis, the dispersion of HICP inflation in euro area countries had remained broadly stable since the late 1990s, at a level similar to the 14 US Metropolitan Statistical Areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.45,0)">During the crisis we saw a temporary increase in inflation dispersion in the euro area but this has been reversed over the past 12 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.1,0)">The picture is similar for the dispersion of GDP growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.03,0)">Before the crisis the dispersion of growth rates was around 2%, in both the euro area and the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Dispersion rose somewhat during the crisis in both currency areas but remained broadly in line with pre-crisis patterns overall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Going one step further, investigation of the sources of this growth dispersion in the US and euro area economies reveals parallels even in the root causes of dispersion in economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Both currency areas comprise regions that experienced a significant boom and bust cycle over the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Both also contain regions that are facing significant structural challenges of a more long-term nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">In the United States, for example, Nevada, Arizona, Florida and California experienced increases in house prices that outpaced the national average by a wide margin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The steep house price increases probably contributed to above average growth in these states, owing to strong positive contributions from real estate, construction and financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">These sectors all saw their share in terms of value added to GDP increase at the national level during the years of the housing boom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">But at the same time, some US states, particularly the former manufacturing powerhouses in the ''Great Lakes'' region, have seen a long episode of below average growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.49,0)">Below average performance of the region – and particularly weaker growth rates in the states of Michigan and Ohio – are related to strong reliance on manufacturing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.45,0)">Structural shifts in the US economy towards services have gradually reduced the value added of manufacturing relative to GDP, with implications for areas with a high concentration of companies in manufacturing industries other than information and communications technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.18,0)">The sharp fall in house prices in Florida and the south-western US states turned boom into bust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.65,0)">These states experienced the harshest recession among the US states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.53,0)">But GDP growth in the ''Great Lakes'' region, which was below average before the crisis, also remained below average during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.94,0)">Similarly, in the euro area some countries experienced asymmetric boom-and-bust cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Several euro area countries had higher than average growth in the pre-crisis years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">In Ireland and Spain particularly, a large part of this growth can be ascribed to increases in housing prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.7,0)">Other countries in Europe – Portugal, for example – have experienced growth persistently below the euro area average for the past decade due to structural issues that could have been tackled with more determination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.39,0)">Just a few years ago, this group of countries included Germany – then labelled, totally wrongly, the “sick man of Europe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Yet Germany is now an example of how big the dividends of reform can be if structural adjustment is made a strategic priority and implemented with sufficient patience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The effect of the crisis on the different euro area economies follows a similar pattern to those of comparable US states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.29,0)">The countries in the euro area that have been hit hardest are those in which either large asset-bubble driven imbalances unwound or structural problems were left unaddressed before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.0,0)">More specifically, Ireland and Greece, in particular, remained in recession in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.34,0)">Those countries that have yet to implement more far reaching structural reforms also have relatively low growth prospects after the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.25,0)">These relatively low growth rates are linked to a deterioration of competitiveness, driven, for example, by persistent above average unit labour costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.43,0)">Ahead of EMU, unit labour costs converged in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">What is more – disregarding the most recent countries to join the euro area – dispersion both ahead of the crisis and during the crisis was very similar in the euro area and the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.13,0)">At the same time, it is worth noting that both currency areas include regions with persistently above or below average unit labour cost growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.51,0)">Again leaving aside the most recent countries to join the euro area, here, Greece, Portugal and Ireland, in particular, have lost competitiveness vis-à-vis their main trading partners in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Germany, in contrast, has been able to lower relative unit labour costs over the same period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.38,0)">Similar persistent losses and gains in competitiveness are also observed in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Some states have experienced large or persistent increases in unit labour costs, currently exceeding the national average by as much as 20%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Other states, on the other hand, have been gaining competitiveness vis-à-vis the national average over the past decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.04,0)">In summary, these results suggest that those who are questioning the viability of the euro area as a single currency area on the grounds of economic heterogeneity are misguided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Over the past 12 years, heterogeneity in the euro area and the United States has been broadly similar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This should, however, be no reason for any complacency in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.21,0)">As the crisis has taught us, persistent losses in competitiveness on the part of individual members in a currency union lead to a build-up of external and internal imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.61,0)">When these unravel, the cost for the affected economies can be very large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.54,0)">They can also have spillover effects on other members of the currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.55,0)">In any union, an economic governance framework is needed to prevent developments in an individual member state endangering the smooth functioning of the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.39,0)">But for EMU, the economic governance framework devised in the 1990s has not been correctly implemented and, in any case, has proved too weak during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The crisis has exposed a clear need for strong reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As I speak today the reform debate is still in progress, and in the last part of my remarks today, I would like to talk briefly about the present reform of economic governance in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Economic governance in the euro area The euro is the only major currency not issued by a single sovereign state, but by a union of states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The Treaties specify a clear division of responsibilities between European and national policy-makers within EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.62,0)">On the one hand, monetary policy is inherently indivisible, and in the euro area it is thus conducted at the supranational level by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">On the other hand, fiscal policies remain largely the competence of national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Today’s reform of the governance framework has to take the current constitutional framework as a given.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">For the foreseeable future we have to empower the institutional arrangements that are already in place to the point at which they can really and durably inspire confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.59,0)">The economic governance framework has been incorrectly implemented and, more importantly, has proven to be insufficiently binding whilst lacking appropriate comprehensiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">The requirements for a very significant reinforcement of the fiscal surveillance of the Stability and Growth Pact and for the creation of a new surveillance of competitive indicators and macroeconomic policy have been discussed widely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">As you know, the ECB takes the strong view that there is the need for more speed and automaticity in the sanctioning mechanism, particularly in the Stability and Growth Pact, but also in the broader macroeconomic policy surveillance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The experience of the past months has vividly demonstrated the importance of a timely correction of internal and external imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Beyond faster and more automatic sanctions, the enforcement tools also need to be more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">The macroeconomic surveillance framework, in particular, needs to provide clear incentives by imposing financial sanctions already at an early stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.51,0)">This also means that there should be no room for discretion in the implementation of the surveillance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">At the same time, requirements on fiscal and other macroeconomic policies should be more ambitious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">To ensure that none of the euro area countries are left behind, they have to bring national policies in line with the membership to a currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The implementation of sound fiscal and macroeconomic policies is best ensured if these are solidly anchoring at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">An effective way of achieving this is to implement strong national budgetary frameworks in the euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Another important area of reform, at the global level, is the reform of financial governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">I have to say that on financial reform we have made more rapid progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">As you know, we have drawn up a set of more stringent banking regulations, more ambitious capital requirements to absorb losses, improving coverage and reducing the risk of excessive borrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The countercyclical capital buffers are designed to reduce pro-cyclicality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">At the same time, the supervision of financial institutions, financial markets and market infrastructure has been tightened, and the organisational structure of financial oversight has been overhauled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The European System Risk Board and the European Supervisory Authorities – the three new authorities created for the European banking sector, insurance and occupational pensions, and capital markets – have taken up their work at the beginning of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The ESRB is in the process of developing the tools necessary to warn and, if appropriate, make recommendations as regards systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">And the ESAs will allow closer monitoring of the interrelationships in the financial system of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.71,0)">But much remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Most importantly, we need to ensure the full implementation of the envisioned reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In addition, key areas where work is still in progress – not only at the European, but also at global level – include: the treatment of systemically important financial institutions; the mechanism of bank crisis management and resolution; oversight of the shadow banking system; and – very importantly – the further regulation and oversight of financial markets and their functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The euro area as a whole has witnessed an unprecedented degree of price stability since its inception more than 12 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">This has been accompanied by economic performance in terms of growth per capita and job creation that compares positively with other large advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">It is also remarkable that there is convincing evidence that the euro area and the United States of America have similar features in terms of diversity of the economies that are part of these vast continents: member countries on this side of the Atlantic and the States on the other side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.64,0)">This is documented, in particular, as regards asymmetric inflation, asymmetric growth developments and even in terms of somewhat persistent asymmetric gains and losses of competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Therefore, it is important to redress a common belief which is unfounded, in my opinion, namely that the euro area as a whole is significantly more heterogeneous economically, with more dispersion and higher levels of standard deviation of a number of important indicators than the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But what remains true is that governing these very vast and equally diverse economies with a single currency is more of a challenge in a union of sovereign states than in a political federation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">That is the reason why the European Central Bank is stressing tirelessly the necessity of strongly reinforcing the euro area economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The economic policy of each member of the euro area has to be aligned with the requirements of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">As Alexander Hamilton said two hundred years ago: we should ourselves “learn to think   continentally”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.14,0)">The 2010 data for US regions are provisional estimates published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis on 7 June 2011.</span>
