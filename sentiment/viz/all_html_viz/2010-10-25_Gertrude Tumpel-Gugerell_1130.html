    <span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)"> Retail sales from a euro area perspective Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the World Retail Congress, Berlin, 25 October 2010 It is a great pleasure for me to be here in Berlin today at the World Retail Congress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Retail sales constitute about 45 percent of private consumption, which in turn amounts to a share of almost 60% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thus, retail sales alone explain around 30 percent of aggregate demand in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">These impressive figures are enough to underline the importance of the retail sector for the overall economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">As you know, the primary objective of the ECB’s monetary policy is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB aims at keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In order to reach this objective we must assess the inflation outlook continuously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We form our view on future inflation by closely following and monitoring a wide range of indicators that affect inflation and the economy’s output of goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Retail sales is one of those indicators and certainly – as the figures above show – an important one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.94,0)">In my presentation I would like to briefly touch on three questions: How was the retail trade sector affected by the crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.29,0)">How do – in general – financial variables and monetary policy affect private consumption and retail trade?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And, what is – in our view - the future outlook for the retail trade sector?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.53,0)">Let me turn to the first question on how sales in retail shops and stores were affected by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.85,0)">In   As GDP and consumption declined in the recent recession, so did retail sales.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.64,0)">During the crisis, households drew back on consumption, hence private consumption growth slowed down on the basis of lower growth in incomes, reflecting mainly weak employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.0,0)">We can see in   In addition, financial wealth declined in 2008, thereby further depressing consumption growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Another key determinant of aggregate demand are consumers’ expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.1,0)">Let me now turn to the second question: How do financial variables and monetary policy affect private consumption decisions and retail trade?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Loans to households, whose developments are presented in   Allow me to elaborate a little bit more on this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Loan developments in the euro area can be explained by their main determinants, such as house prices, various interest rates and real income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In line with this, we saw that the annual growth rate of loans to households – after some months in negative territory – has turned positive towards the end of 2009 and since then has continued to increase steadily  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This positive annual growth of loans to households reflects mainly developments in lending for house purchase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.7,0)">Loans for consumer credit are still contributing negatively to overall loan growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">These latest developments in loans to households confirm the broad consistency with business cycle regularities, which suggest that the turning point in the growth of loans to households takes place early in the economic cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">The loan development needs to be seen in the context of the current low level of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.42,0)">Indeed, bank lending rates for loans to households for house purchase declined further in the second quarter of 2010 - still to a lesser extent than in the previous quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The levels of lending rates for loans to households we are currently seeing are comparable to the levels observed in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.48,0)">For shorter-term maturities, the interest rates are even lower than in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.34,0)">Still, at the same time, the net percentage of banks reporting a tightening of credit standards for loans to households remained unchanged in the second quarter of 2010, compared with the previous quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Overall, we can see that the ECB’s monetary policy since the onset of the financial crisis has been very much supporting private consumption demand, and thereby retail sales, while keeping a clear orientation to preserve price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">During the crisis also fiscal policy was used to stabilise consumers spending and retail sales.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This raised obviously the question on whether fiscal policy in a period of recession should take a more forceful orientation to stimulate consumption or a more prudent approach to discretionary fiscal policy making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.9,0)">In my view, while the operation of automatic stabilisers, whose impact on activity, income distribution and the sustainability of public finances is reasonably well understood and comparatively easy to predict, discretionary changes – particularly if they are temporary – have mostly a short-living effect on demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The car-scrapping schemes implemented in several countries are a good example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Schemes geared towards car purchases certainly stimulated demand in a period of high uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But such influence has not affected the underlying trend of demand of automobiles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In   It may however have contributed to the swift recovery of the industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So far I discussed the main determinants of private consumption demand on a euro area aggregate level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me, however, also mention that the aggregate developments in the area mask heterogeneous and even divergent changes in different member countries that have been subject to shocks of a diverse nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Before coming to an end, let me touch on my final question on the future outlook of the overall economy and consumption and retail in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Recent statistical releases and survey evidence continue to be consistent with the picture of a positive underlying momentum of the recovery in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The global recovery is expected to continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">At the same time, private sector domestic demand should gradually strengthen further, supported by the accommodative monetary policy stance and the measures adopted to restore the functioning of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">However, the recovery in activity is expected to be dampened by the process of balance sheet adjustment in various sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">We expect private consumption to grow at relatively moderate rates in the coming quarters before starting to gradually strengthen again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.45,0)">This can be explained by: First, still weak labour markets and moderate growth in compensation per employee are likely to continue to prevent any significant rebound of disposable income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Nevertheless, real incomes are expected to benefit somewhat from improved corporate profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.49,0)">Second, even though the saving ratio may decline slightly more, it wouldn’t surprise me if it remained above its pre-crisis level over the coming years as a result of heightened economic uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">And third, a further strengthening in the growth rate of loans to households may still be contained by continued high debt levels and subdued developments in euro area house prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.31,0)">At the same time, the results of the latest bank lending survey indicate that banks expect a lower degree of net tightening of credit standards for loans to households for house purchase in the third quarter of 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.56,0)">The same holds regarding credit standards for loans to households for consumer credit and other lending, where banks still expect a net tightening but somewhat less so in the third quarter of 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.45,0)">In conclusion, let me summarise my main points: The development in retail sales and hence also total demand in the economy were affected negatively the recent financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">EU governments and the ECB have reacted to the crisis in a swift and effective manner, avoiding worse outcomes and bringing the economy back on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">With regard to the future, I am confident that the economy is on a good recovery track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Now is the time to ensure that recovery and to make the growth prospect sustainable for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">For this I see three major policy challenges ahead: First, it is important to engage in sound fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Indeed, a number of countries have to meet major challenges, and immediate, ambitious and convincing corrective actions are required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">It is crucial to strengthen public confidence in the capacity of governments to return to sustainable public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">If such a consolidation process is pursued in a credible way, short-term effects on economic growth could be followed by the positive effect of consolidation on confidence and the expectations for future growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Second, the urgent implementation of far-reaching structural reforms is essential to enhance the prospects for higher sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.03,0)">Major reforms are particularly needed in those countries that have experienced a loss of competitiveness in the past or that are suffering from high fiscal and external deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Reforms are needed in the area of labour markets in order to strengthen productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">We also need increased product market competition and greater investments in education to facilitate restructuring and to foster innovation and the adoption of new technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And third, we at the ECB have the responsibility to continuously ensure low and stable inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">This will support the purchasing power of euro area households, facilitate price comparisons and lower the real cost of credits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">As we have delivered on this in the past 11 years, I am confident that we will continue to do this in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
