    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)"> The euro area economy: current prospects and challenges ahead Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECBat the Economic Club of New YorkNew York, 10 October 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to be here with you today and I would like to take this opportunity to talk about what is happening in Europe right now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">As you know, the euro area as a whole is undergoing a process of fundamental reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">The overarching objective is to lay the foundations for recovery and more jobs, to foster financial stability and fiscal sustainability and to enhance international competitiveness for the benefit of all parts of the economy and wider society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Reform will be a lengthy process and while it is far from complete, perhaps for the first time we are seeing signs of significant progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">National policy-makers in Europe are able to focus a little less on short-term difficulties and a little more on their longer-term responsibilities to strengthen the resilience of their domestic economies while developing their growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">And the monetary policy that we at the European Central Bank   are implementing will accompany the reform process by maintaining the degree of accommodation that is most appropriate, given our economic outlook and the risks that surround it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The economic situation and outlook So let me start with an overview of the current situation and outlook for the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Recent data releases support our baseline outlook of a nascent economic recovery over the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Following six quarters of negative output growth, euro area real GDP rose by 0.3% in the second quarter of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.93,0)">Although more recent data has pointed to a fairly slow start in the third quarter, survey-based confidence indicators give some comfort that the turning point in economic activity that we saw earlier in the year has not reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Taken together, incoming information has confirmed the growth outlook from the September ECB staff projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">While these projections still see real GDP shrinking by 0.4% this year, a positive growth rate of 1% is expected for 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.59,0)">But the pace of recovery is going to be subdued and uneven across countries for as long as it is meaningful for us to look into the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.45,0)">The unemployment rate, currently standing at 12.1%, remains unacceptably high, and the risks around the outlook continue to be tilted to the downside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.12,0)">In keeping with the broad-based weakness in aggregate demand, underlying price pressures remain subdued as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.95,0)">Annual euro area headline inflation is projected to reach 1.5% this year, before declining to 1.3% in 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.84,0)">These levels are historically very moderate, and remain in the lower part of the range of values that the ECB’s Governing Council has identified as consistent with the ECB’s quantitative definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">That said, inflation expectations continue to be firmly anchored in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">And the risks to the outlook for price developments are expected to be broadly balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.23,0)">Finally, monetary and in particular credit dynamics remain weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.58,0)">The annual growth rate of loans to the private sector has remained well inside negative territory; and the pace of contraction has actually accelerated over the recent period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.18,0)">Certainly, weak loan dynamics can largely be explained by the current stage of the business cycle but we have to be attentive to alleviate structural and supply-side factors that may hamper credit provision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The significant improvement in the funding situation of banks since the summer of 2012 has partly offset supply-side restrictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">But it will be some time before the more permissive funding conditions faced by many banks turn into an active spur for credit creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The strategy of euro area policy-makers Against this background, how should policy-makers respond to the still fragile macroeconomic recovery?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">In my view, we need a three-pronged strategy: First, monetary policy has to remain consistently supportive of the baseline outlook and mitigate the risks that surround it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Our price stability mandate is sufficiently precise to keep us concentrated on that mission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">But preserving monetary accommodation is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the recovery to take hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">A second essential ingredient is that countries continue the adjustment of their domestic policies in a way that removes structural impediments to their economic potential and fosters long-term fiscal sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Monetary accommodation can accompany and facilitate such a regime shift in economic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.05,0)">But we know it can never replace it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Third and equally important, Europe has to continue the reform process in its banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Sound finance is part and parcel of a dynamic economy and banks remain a major conduit of finance in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Hence, we must establish conditions that align incentives of individual financial institutions with those of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Let me explain the measures that European policy-makers are taking in each of these areas: monetary policy; fiscal and structural adjustment; and banking reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.98,0)">Monetary policy Let me start with monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As you know, the Treaty clearly prioritises price stability as the ECB’s primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Within this disciplining framework, we tailor our policy response to the challenges at hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">In response to the events of the past six years, we’ve taken swift and resolute action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.8,0)">We cut the main policy rates to record lows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">We provided funding support to euro area banks over long time horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">And we counteracted and removed unwarranted fears of a breakup of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In July this year, we again expanded our toolkit to protect the nascent recovery from the risk that it could be choked off prematurely by an unwelcome restriction in monetary conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">To that effect, the ECB’s Governing Council adopted explicit communication on how it expects its key interest rates to evolve in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.13,0)">In particular, we have communicated our expectation that the key interest rates will remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">This expectation is based on our assessment that the subdued inflation outlook extends into the medium term, given the broad-based weakness in the real economy and subdued monetary dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">What was the rationale for adopting ‘forward guidance’?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.46,0)">In June and July, we observed substantial volatility in money market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.0,0)">The pricing of term interbank credit in the money market – the first stage of the transmission of monetary policy to the broader economy – had become increasingly divorced from euro area fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.83,0)">Markets tended to overreact to news that was either not directly relevant to the euro area macroeconomic outlook or simply confirmed our baseline scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Against this background, our forward guidance aimed at better aligning money market conditions with our policy intentions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In interpreting our forward guidance, there are three essential elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">First, it acknowledges the scope for further cuts in our key interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In other words, the adoption of forward guidance does not imply that we’ve reached the effective lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Indeed, the opposite is the case: the Governing Council has unanimously agreed to incorporate an easing bias into our forward guidance that explicitly provides for the possibility of further rate reductions, should the volatility in money market conditions return to the levels observed in the early summer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Second, our forward guidance is specifically tailored to the ECB’s mandate and monetary policy strategy: the path of the policy rates remains conditional on the outlook for inflation; and it will be reviewed over time against the analytical framework underlying the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This means that we assess whether the medium-term outlook for inflation remains subdued against two types of metrics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.63,0)">On the one hand, economic indicators pointing to persistent slack in the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.55,0)">On the other hand, monetary indicators pointing to persistent subdued dynamics in money and credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The third element of our forward guidance is that, by confirming our policy framework, it refocuses attention on what matters most for our monetary policy, namely the medium-term inflation outlook in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">On our side, it induces the sort of prudent language in communicating about the economy and the type of balanced and steady response to economic news that is needed in the exceptional circumstances in which we currently have to steer our monetary policy course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The observed decline in market uncertainty about future short-term rates indicates that our forward guidance has helped to anchor market expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Going forward, we will carefully assess developments in money markets and liquidity conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">We have to ensure that interest rate expectations remain firmly anchored around a path that does not add to downside risks to the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Thus, our monetary policy stance will continue to be geared towards maintaining the degree of accommodation warranted by the outlook for price stability and promoting stable money market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">It thereby provides support to a gradual recovery in economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Fiscal consolidation and competitiveness But preserving monetary policy accommodation is not sufficient in itself for the recovery to take hold and become self-sustaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This leads me to the second element of the policy response: repairing the fiscal and structural problems that hold back individual euro area economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.43,0)">A painful lesson from the last few years is that we all underestimated the destructive potential that myopic national policies could exert on the euro area’s collective body, and on the world economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is time to remove the institutional shortcomings that allowed imbalances to build up in the national economies and escalate into systemic threats in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.99,0)">In the euro area, two such shortcomings were particularly consequential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.22,0)">First, the EU fiscal rules were weakly enforced and, as such, incapable of promoting prudent fiscal policies in times of favourable economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.49,0)">Second, there was no mechanism to prevent and correct macroeconomic imbalances within the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.48,0)">This resulted in an incentive vacuum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.1,0)">Rather than exploiting the advantages of monetary union for a modernisation of domestic economies, several countries simply delayed necessary adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.59,0)">And the elimination of exchange rate fluctuations and the levelling-off of spreads in sovereign borrowing costs that preceded the downturn deactivated the market forces that previously had disciplined macroeconomic policies at the country level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">European policy-makers are addressing these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Due to a recent strengthening of the EU fiscal rules, Member States now face stronger incentives to adopt sound budgetary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Moreover, a new ‘Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure’ has been established at EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">It requires governments to adopt competitiveness-enhancing policies and tackle potential sources of financial instability in their domestic economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Reflecting this reform momentum at the European level, governments are tackling imbalances in their domestic economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">They are implementing reforms to reverse the misguided policies of the past and to create sustainable long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Progress is steady and the data increasingly show that governments are heading in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.47,0)">Euro area countries have cut their fiscal deficit ratios by half since their peak in 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Excluding interest payments, euro area Member States on aggregate are expected to run a small surplus by the end of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.24,0)">This is clearly in contrast to other industrial economies, such as the US or Japan, which last year still recorded primary deficits of 6% and 8% of GDP, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">We are also seeing some noteworthy improvements in competitiveness and external positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.17,0)">The countries under full EU-IMF programmes have seen their unit labour costs fall by more than 10% since 2008, relative to the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">Their current accounts have improved by around 8% of GDP since then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">In short, there is progress towards more solid economic fundamentals in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">But maintaining the current momentum of reform is essential for ensuring stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Bank balance sheets and banking union Finally, a sustainable recovery requires healthy financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">We have seen much progress in the banking sector of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Since the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007 euro area banks have raised around €225 billion of fresh capital and another €275 billion has been injected by governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">All in all, this amounts to more than 5% of euro area GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">As a result, the average Core Tier 1 ratio of the largest euro area banks currently stands well above 11% and the majority of euro area banks already comply with the minimum capital requirements of the fully implemented Basel III framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.99,0)">Furthermore, in countries under financial assistance programmes, problematic legacy assets have been removed from banks’ balance sheets to ensure that they will no longer curb banks’ lending to profitable businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">More progress is on its way in terms of the institutional architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Europe’s Economic and Monetary Union   will be complemented by a European banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Last month, the European Parliament cleared the way for the single supervisory mechanism, which tasks the ECB with overseeing major parts of the European banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">By placing this responsibility with an independent institution at European level, the new supervisory mechanism will allow for more stringent and consistent supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">This will, ultimately, afford an earlier identification of financial risk – in both individual institutions and the financial sector as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Looking forward, two objectives need to be addressed: First, we need to create full transparency about the risks on banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">And, second, we need to align investors’ incentives with those of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">A comprehensive balance sheet assessment will be a crucial preparatory step before we begin our new supervisory task in autumn 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">This will serve to strengthen transparency and to mitigate the risk of the possible emergence of problem banks in the early days of operation of the new supervisory mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This balance sheet assessment, to be conducted by the ECB together with national supervisors and an independent third party, will consist of a supervisory risk assessment and a thorough asset quality review that in turn will be an input for a stress test to be jointly carried out with the European Banking Authority  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The three elements combined will ensure a comprehensive assessment, identifying remaining risks on banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">To strengthen incentives, the institutional architecture will be augmented by the single resolution mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">As a first step to overcoming the existing problems of incentive incompatibility, harmonised rules and procedures for bank recovery and resolution are currently being developed at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">These harmonised frameworks should be implemented at national level as soon as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">But to ensure a fully consistent and effective application of these rules, their implementation should be placed within the remit of an independent authority that reinforces the new supervisory framework at a European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">To that effect, the EU’s institutional architecture should be augmented by a single resolution mechanism that executes bank resolution in a timely and impartial manner and formulates its decisions from a clear, encompassing European perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">By enhancing transparency and incentive compatibility, the combination of the single supervisory mechanism and the single resolution mechanism will help Europe return to a situation in which investment decisions will be based on business prospects, not on geographical location.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.36,0)">The recovery remains in its infancy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.71,0)">Given the prolonged build-up of macroeconomic imbalances in the past, we have to be prepared for a protracted and anaemic process in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Yet we should also not exaggerate the euro area’s challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.55,0)">While the unemployment rate has increased more in the euro area than in the US during the crisis, the employment rate in the US has fallen further than in the euro area, which makes the figures difficult to compare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Moreover, the euro area has a strategy to return to sustainable growth and employment, and that strategy is being executed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">What is essential is that all policy-makers in the euro area play their part and stay the course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The rewards that will result from the reform of our economic institutions cannot be overestimated.</span>
