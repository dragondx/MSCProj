    <span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)"> The monetary policy strategy review: some preliminary considerations Speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, at the “ECB and Its Watchers XXI” conference Frankfurt am Main, 30 September 2020 Thank you for inviting me to address this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This morning, I would like to speak to you about the ECB’s strategy review, the reasons we are conducting it, and our expectations as a result of it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Since 2003, when we last conducted a strategy review, the euro area and the world economy have undergone profound changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.8,0)">The consensus that has governed monetary policy worldwide has been challenged on a number of fronts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.9,0)">Most importantly, the last decade has been defined by a persistent decline in inflation among advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.42,0)">In the euro area, annual inflation averaged 2.3% from 1999 to the eve of the great financial crisis in August 2008, but only 1.2% from then until the end of 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.48,0)">This environment poses fundamental questions for central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We need to thoroughly analyse the forces that are driving inflation dynamics today, and consider whether and how we should adjust our policy strategy in response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">To inform this analysis, we also want to hear from a wide variety of stakeholders – including citizens, academics, parliamentarians and civil society organisations – about how they perceive our goals and actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This is why we have launched the “ECB Listens” programme, in which we will aim to listen to as many voices as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.33,0)">As we have just restarted our strategy review – we put it on hold when the coronavirus   pandemic struck – I will not be presenting any conclusions today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Now is the time for listening and reflecting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But I will discuss the main issues we are looking at and some of the key questions we will be asking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In my remarks today I will cover three topics: first, the definition of our inflation objective; second, the relationship between inflation and the real economy; and third, the transmission and effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">None of these issues can be considered in isolation and we need a well-rounded view of all elements in order to draw conclusions for the strategy review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The inflation objective I start with the inflation objective because it anchors the inflation process for the whole economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Three issues will feature particularly prominently in our review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The first is how to formulate the inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The arguments in favour of central banks aiming for positive inflation rates with a sufficient buffer away from zero were articulated during our strategy review in 2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">It compensates for possible measurement bias, helps countries rebalance their economies within a monetary union and creates a buffer against deflation, as well as leading to higher nominal interest rates over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">That helps ensure that monetary policy is not forced too often towards the effective lower bound – the level of interest rates at which further cuts do not have the desired positive impact – when faced with shocks that push inflation too low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Since 2003, the ECB has used a double-key formulation to set our objective, defining price stability as a year-on-year increase in inflation of “below 2%”, while aiming for inflation of “below, but close to, 2%”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This formulation was appropriate at a time when the ECB was seeking to establish credibility and too-high inflation was its main worry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">As our research shows, it was a key factor in successfully capping inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">But in the current environment of lower inflation, the concerns we face are different and this needs to be reflected in our inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Ensuring that there is sufficient space above zero to re-empower conventional monetary policy becomes more important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">And, to underpin inflation expectations, we need to ensure that our aim is perceived to be symmetric by the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">So we should have an inflation aim that the public can easily understand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The second issue is the horizon over which price stability should be achieved, which is captured by the ECB’s “medium term” orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">This forward-looking orientation reflects traditional and well-established principles of prudent monetary policy, which is consistent with the notion that monetary policy works with a lag and can influence inflation over the medium term rather than the near term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">But within the ECB’s framework, the medium-term orientation has also been a way for the Governing Council to take into account what is happening in the real economy, including employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">We have a hierarchical mandate with price stability at the t  and Pradhan, M.  , The Great Demographic Reversal: Ageing Societies, Waning Inequality, and an Inflation Revival, Palgrave Macmillan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Candia, B., Coibion, O. and Gorodnichenko, Y.  , “Communication and the beliefs of economic agents”, paper presented at the 2020 Economic Policy Symposium, Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City;
