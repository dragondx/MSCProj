    <span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)"> The regulatory and supervisory reform in Europe Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBThe Eurofi Financial Forum 2009Göteborg, 30 September 2009 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be here among you and to say a few words of introduction before this distinguished panel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The purpose of my intervention is to lay out the main issues for our discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Substantive progress has been made in the regulatory and supervisory reform as a response to the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">A remarkable amount of technical work has been undertaken in a demanding timeframe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">All relevant initiatives have been coordinated globally, and the European Union has been a frontrunner in a number key areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.79,0)">Let me mention three of them: credit rating agencies, hedge funds and compensation practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">On credit rating agencies, the EU has already adopted regulation that will subject credit rating agencies to mandatory registration and oversight, to increase transparency and reduce conflicts of interest in the rating process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">With regard to hedge funds, the European Commission has proposed a Directive on alternative investment fund managers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This proposal, which is currently under debate, provides that alternative investment fund managers be subject to authorisation and harmonised regulatory standards, including minimum capital, as well as disclosure requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">On compensation practices, the European Commission was among the first to incorporate in a Directive the Principles developed by the Financial Stability Board   for sound compensation practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Moreover, the EU has been driving the international agenda in developing further implementation standards that will align compensation practices with long-term value creation, and discourage excessive risk-taking in the short-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.16,0)">As a result, the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh calls on banks to defer bonus payments, disallow guaranteed bonuses, and introduce a claw-back clause.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Overall, agreement has been reached globally on a comprehensive set of measures in response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The capital framework has been strengthened by introducing stricter requirements for the treatment of securitisation exposures and off-balance sheet vehicles, as well as for credit risk in the trading book.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Disclosure requirements have been improved, to reduce uncertainty about banks’ overall exposures in these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.86,0)">Guidance has been published to address the shortcomings in banks’ risk management practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Finally, international cooperation has been very strongly reinforced and supervisory colleges for large complex financial groups have been established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">While a lot has been achieved, a lot remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.45,0)">This is no time for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Looking ahead, legislative proposals should fully reflect the ongoing work at international and EU level aiming at enhancing the resilience of the financial system and protect consumers and investors against the impact of excessive risk taking and irresponsible market practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Main priorities include: strengthening the prudential framework; addressing the risks posed by systemically important institutions; and setting a framework for macro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">First, future regulatory reform will aim at improving the level and quality of capital for credit institutions as well as developing a framework for liquidity risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The quality of capital, especially the so called Tier-1 capital which is of utmost importance for loss-absorption on going concern and crisis situations, will significantly improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Capital buffers will be introduced to mitigate the inherent procyclical nature of financial activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">A leverage ratio will be introduced as a supplementary measure to the Basel II risk control framework curb excessive balance sheet growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Finally, a harmonised treatment for liquidity risk is also upcoming, requiring banks to hold sufficient high-quality liquid assets to withstand financial stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">These measures, when implemented, will address many of the shortcoming highlighted by the financial crisis, and will increase the ability of financial institutions to withstand shocks and thus the resilience of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Second, legislative reform also needs to address the moral hazard stemming from systemically important financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In a resilient financial system it cannot and should not be taken for granted that authorities will always come to the rescue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.1,0)">Financial institutions, whatever their size and interconnectedness should not cause undue distress to the functioning of the financial system and to the economy as a whole, if and when mismanagement drive them to bankruptcy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We also need to review resolution regimes and bankruptcy laws in light of recent experience to ensure an orderly winding-down of systemic cross-border financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In this respect the legislative work planned by the Commission is very important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The EU Commission will soon launch a public consultation on a new Communication in which policy options to set-up an EU banking resolution framework will be highlighted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In addition, it will be relevant to enhance the framework for coordination among the relevant authorities for financial stability in case of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The third area relates to macro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">One of the key lessons stemming from the financial crisis relates to the importance of understanding and assessing the degree of “interconnectedness” between market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.95,0)">In particular, the crisis demonstrated that the nature and magnitude of the systemic risk in the financial sector is related not only to the potential illiquidity or insolvency of large banks or other major regulated financial institutions, but it also depends on the close intertwining between financial institutions, markets and infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The financial stability framework needs to be able to identify and assess systemic risks corresponding to the degree of “interconnectedness” I just mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In this context, macro-prudential oversight would focus on factors and risks that can affect the stability of the financial system as a whole and therefore would complement micro-prudential supervision, which looks at the stability of individual financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Macroprudential oversight will be the key task of the European Systemic Risk Board  , which is built on the proposals of the group chaired by Jacques de Larosière.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.6,0)">What will be the activities of the ESRB and what is its value added?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The ESRB will be expected to actively monitor the various sources of risk to financial stability in the EU – across countries and across financial sectors, and also taking into account global developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As a result of this monitoring, the ESRB can identify the risks and analyse in-depth how they could impact the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Stress-testing and other methodologies could assist the risk prioritisation exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The value-added to be provided by the ESRB is to link, in particular, macro-economic conditions, structural developments, and key vulnerabilities of financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This will permit to identify system-wide risks for the benefit of regulatory and supervisory policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The monitoring, assessment and collection of information on sources of risk to be conducted by the ESRB, at the level of the entire EU, is of the essence, given the advanced financial integration of the internal market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In addition, the risks for Europe stemming from global sources will also need to be considered, also in coordination with the IMF and the FSB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.23,0)">The financial stability monitoring in the EU as a whole will provide significant analytical and informational challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">A large part of the effectiveness of the ESRB will rely on the quality and solidity of the analysis and information underlying its financial stability assessments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">It will be important to set-up efficient arrangements between the ESRB and the new European Supervisory Authorities for the mutual cooperation and exchange of information, as foreseen in the Commission’s legislative proposals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This would allow avoiding multiple reporting from financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In order to support the new European macro-prudential function, as decided by the Ecofin, the ECB will provide analytical, statistical, administrative and logistical support, also drawing on the technical advice from national central banks and supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Accordingly, we will optimise our present capabilities and infrastructure in the areas of financial stability monitoring, macro-economic analysis, and collection of statistical information, to the benefit of the ESRB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">This aims at reaping the maximum synergies in terms of expertise, resources and infrastructures with the existing central bank activities in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">The next few years are crucial for building up a strong, competitive and less leveraged financial system which will be subject to proper regulation and supervision, both at micro and macroprudential level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Europe should play a leading role in these developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The panel discussion could help identify the most pressing priorities.</span>
