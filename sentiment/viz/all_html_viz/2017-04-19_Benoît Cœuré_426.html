    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.03,0)"> The perils of isolation Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Council on Foreign Relations, New York, 19 April 2017 We are currently seeing widespread concerns in many parts of the world regarding free trade and globalised finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.61,0)">These concerns mainly stem from perceptions of inequality of opportunities and a lack of inclusiveness in sharing the benefits of international openness, resulting in growing disparities in income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.43,0)">Often, these are not only perceptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In this country, for example, net income inequality has been on an upward trend since the late 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Although globalisation might have amplified growing income inequality, empirical analysis tends to suggest that technological progress, and the associated rise in demand for skilled labour over low-skilled, is likely to explain most of the rise in income inequality in advanced economies since the early 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.03,0)">And yet, fears of globalisation appear to dominate public discussion and are likely to have been a key factor in fomenting political opposition to the free movement of goods, services, capital, and people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.07,0)">Much has been said about the perils of rising protectionism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Today, I would like to focus on a related but distinct risk, namely all the talk of a weakening of the international financial regulatory agreements that were reinforced in the wake of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.9,0)">Such a push-back would be all the more difficult to understand as there is compelling empirical evidence that excessive risk taking by the financial sector has contributed to rising inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.53,0)">Dismantling regulatory standards would therefore not only make financial markets less safe, it would also be unfair to those who feel left behind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Indeed, in recent years, through the actions of the Financial Stability Board   and standard-setting committees such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the international community has made important progress in rewriting the international financial rule book with a view to curbing financial exuberance, protecting taxpayers from costly bailouts, and improving cross-border cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">These reforms have undoubtedly made global financial markets more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">And they have also supported the recovery of loan growth to households and firms despite claims that regulation may hurt economic growth and dent bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Indeed, researchers at the Bank for International Settlements have found that soundly capitalised banks tend to lend more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Our experience in the euro area corroborates this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The phasing in of new regulatory standards has helped bring about a measurable increase in euro banks’ capital ratios in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In parallel, and supported by the ECB’s comprehensive monetary policy measures, bank loans to the real economy have recovered steadily from their cyclical   troughs and, towards the end of last year, were increasing at their fastest pace since the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">This suggests that a sound regulatory framework is an essential element of a country’s growth agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But in an integrated global economy, financial regulation has to rely on internationally agreed standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">To the extent that countries around the world are signing up to these standards, the conditions for growth in a financially stable environment are being reinforced globally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.89,0)">Of course, this does not mean that we should not look back and evaluate critically what has been done already.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The FSB, together with other bodies, will undertake a broad evaluation of the individual and combined effects of past reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It will assess if the initial objectives have been achieved or if there are any unintended consequences that call for changes to the regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.73,0)">It will also assess whether reforms aimed at different industries or market segments have created conflicting incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">And it will take stock of the progress achieved in curbing risk taking outside of the banking sector and in strengthening the resilience of financial market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But this exercise should not be mistaken for tolerance of hidden forms of financial protectionism or a relaxation of regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.11,0)">Turning back the clock on international financial regulation would revive distrust, create financial fragmentation, and risk regulatory arbitrage and a race to the bottom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.68,0)">The stakes are too high to allow such short-termism to thrive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.26,0)">While unilateral financial deregulation may yield quick benefits, its potentially harmful implications for financial stability and, ultimately, economic growth are not likely to be felt until later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And then, those implications would be felt worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.04,0)">Ultimately, this would leave the most vulnerable members of society very exposed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">More than ever, we Europeans are convinced that belonging to the European Union   helps us maximise the benefits of international cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It minimises the risks of short-sighted unilateralism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">It offers a framework that disciplines Member States to work towards the common objectives and values enshrined in our treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">It leverages the experience gained as one of the world’s largest markets, which has existed for 60 years under a single rule of law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And it reminds us that there is no fair exchange without an agreed and enforceable set of rules, domestically and internationally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Despite daunting challenges, the EU and the euro area in particular have a track record of overcoming common challenges through cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The creation of a single banking supervisor for the euro area, along with a single framework for bank recovery and resolution, is a recent case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">It has created a level playing field for banks operating across the euro area that strengthens financial stability, eliminates double standards and can protect European taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The European Commission’s recent steps to curb illegal tax benefits for multinationals and to promote a common corporate tax base are another example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">Progress on this front is essential as globalisation has made it more difficult to effectively tax multinational companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Globalisation will be sustainable only if its benefits are spread across society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.71,0)">This is not something that market forces alone can correct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is possible only if governments keep control of their tax and benefit systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Effective tax cooperation can tilt the balance towards rebuilding trust in globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Strengthening these efforts is advisable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Globalisation has already helped to raise our living standards considerably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Over the past 25 years, world trade has increased by about twice as much as GDP, financial openness has quadrupled and millions of people, particularly in emerging and developing markets, have been lifted out of poverty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Regional and multilateral trade and financial agreements, alongside the creation of international financial and regulatory institutions and bodies, have significantly contributed to this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Many of us have taken these developments for granted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In Europe, for example, younger generations have grown up in the belief that the free movement of people, goods, services and capital is an unqualified right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The current zeitgeist forces us to put aside our complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">As the benefits and legitimacy of international cooperation are being called into question, it’s essential to defend the values that underlie global economic governance – openness, collaboration and tolerance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Those who cherish the benefits of international cooperation should make their voices heard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">They should highlight past achievements and explain why continued and strengthened cooperation is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This appeal must be seen as an opportunity and responsibility, not as a chore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">I would like to thank J. Beirne, M. Ca’ Zorzi and M. Grill for their contributions to this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I remain solely responsible for the opinions contained herein.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.31,0)">g., Solt, F.  , The Standardized World Income Inequality Database, Social Science Quarterly 97 , 1267-81.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In other advanced economies, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.48,0)">France and Norway, net income inequality has remained fairly constant in recent decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">, K.
