    <span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)"> European integration: the benefits of acting collectively Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the Feri Foundation award ceremonyKaisersaal, Frankfurt am Main, 9 June 2010 Lord Mayor, Mr Stammler, Mr Sloterdijk, Mr Görlitz, Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here paying tribute to the winners of this year’s Feri Foundation Award and share a few thoughts with you on this occasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.33,0)">Given that we will have an ECB Governing Council meeting tomorrow, let me clarify from the outset that nothing in my remarks this morning should be interpreted with regard to current monetary policy issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Turning to today’s event, I am impressed and deeply moved by the charitable work done by the various foundations that have won this award over the years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As different as they are, they all have several things in common.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">They all strive to make a difference to our society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And they do so through targeted efforts, acting in a way that complements the work of public institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">The work they do is a heartening expression of their solidarity with their fellow citizens, and they deserve the gratitude of society as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The challenges ahead of us Solidarity will also be the focus of my remarks today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">However, I will approach it from a slightly different angle – a European angle, as befits a European institution such as the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">My main message today is that, in the current circumstances, the very existence of solidarity can give rise to confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.08,0)">The financial crisis, which has lasted quite some time, has placed our economies and societies under considerable strain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Policy-makers have had to make bold and far-reaching decisions in order to address the most acute of challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">They have done so in order to preserve the cohesion within and across our societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">We have also begun work on the more profound reforms that will need to be implemented if we are to address the underlying deficiencies that have become apparent in our financial systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">We need to make our financial institutions more resilient and re-establish a sense of values, in particular a strong sense of responsibility vis-à-vis the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">To achieve this, legislators and regulators may have to introduce a new set of incentives for those operating in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">This is one of the lessons that we have learned from the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Other lessons concern the construction of Europe, where we have to make a quantum leap in strengthening the governance of economic policies and surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">If we do this, I believe that we will exit the crisis with a policy framework that will be much better and stronger than the one we had when the crisis began.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Some observers have said that the solution to our difficulties lies in more – not less – European integration, and I agree with this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.8,0)">Let me explain why.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Working together to meet these challenges is not just an act of solidarity; it is very much in the best interests of all the participating countries and their citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Monetary Union is not a matter of convenience; it offers us protection and improves resilience, provided that we embrace the underlying ideas and principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Just as the idea of statehood is that citizens gain from acting collectively, the European Union embodies the idea that nations also gain from acting collectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">European integration is a long-term process, one that began after the Second World War and has brought stability and peace to our continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The crisis is now prompting us to ponder the direction in which our next steps should take us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This discussion is taking place not because we have failed, but because we have been successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Europe has succeeded in virtually everything it has sought to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The ECB’s responsibility As regards the ECB, we are responsible for ensuring medium-term price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The citizens of Europe can rely on us to focus on this objective at all times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">We have the tools we need to ensure price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">The fact that the ECB has full statutory independence gives us credibility in our pursuit of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The mandate and independence of the Eurosystem are enshrined in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The people of Germany and the other countries of the euro area can rely on us to continue delivering price stability in the years to come, just as they have been able to rely on us in the first 11½ years of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">During that period the general price level has risen by an average of just below 2% per year – in line with our definition of price stability and better than was achieved by any of the currencies that merged to form the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, Public policy-makers make decisions on behalf of the people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.36,0)">In Economic and Monetary Union, monetary policy decisions are delegated to an independent central bank: the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This framework is appropriate and has delivered the results that the Treaty demands and that our 330 million fellow citizens expect from us, namely medium-term price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The framework for policy-making in the area of fiscal policy needs to inspire the same level of confidence as the framework for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The crisis has shown that reforms to improve fiscal surveillance and control are needed in order to achieve this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">These reforms are necessary, and they are under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.62,0)">Looking back, it is a pity that it has taken a crisis for everybody to realise this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Looking ahead, I think that everybody now understands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Let me close my remarks this morning – which I repeat have no bearing on current monetary policy matters – by recalling that in Economic and Monetary Union we share a common destiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Wir teilen ein gemeinsames Schicksal.</span>
