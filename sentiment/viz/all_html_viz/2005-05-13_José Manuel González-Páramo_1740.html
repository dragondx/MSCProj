    <span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)"> Taxation, tax reform and monetary policy Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBUniversidad ComplutenseMadrid, 13 May 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.06,0)">Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, The present Governor of the Bank of England, Mr Mervyn King, once observed that “Central banks are often accused of being obsessed with inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.41,0)">This is untrue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.68,0)">If they are obsessed with anything, it is with fiscal policy.”  I would not go quite as far as to call it an obsession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But it is certainly true that central bankers in general, and European central bankers in particular, take a close interest in public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And this is hardly surprising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Perhaps it is not by chance that having a strong public finance background -experience either in academia or in government, or in both - is not uncommon amongst central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.94,0)">I would not elaborate more on whether and how the professional career of central bankers affect their interest in public finance issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But on a more factual note, it is key to remark that in the euro area close to 50% of GDP is channelled through the government accounts and governments are by far the largest issuers in securities markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.55,0)">Government taxation and expenditure have a considerable impact on the macro economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.43,0)">And this cannot be ignored when formulating monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.98,0)">It would be an exhausting exercise to try and summarise all possible inter-linkages between fiscal policy and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">So I shall make life a little easier by focusing on just one side of the government’s balance sheet, namely the revenue side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">More specifically, the subject I wish to address today is relationship between taxation, tax reform and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The primary objective of most central banks, including that of the ECB, is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.87,0)">Therefore, taxation essentially matters for monetary policy to the extent that is has an impact on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And the channels through which it does so are both numerous and complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.48,0)">The effects can be direct, or indirect, short or long term, temporary or permanent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.48,0)">Taxes affect relative prices in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.1,0)">And changes in tax rates lead to changes in relative prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The way in which prices and quantities of factors and goods and services react to such changes in relative prices can be an important determinant of inflation in the short to medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.47,0)">But the story does not end there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Tax rates also have an important impact on the long-term dynamics of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The structure of the tax system determines the incentive structure for economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.73,0)">Decisions to invest in human or physical capital and to supply labour - decisions that help to determine the potential growth rate of the economy and the ability of the economy to adjust to shocks - also depend to a large extent on the level and structure of taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is these effects of taxation, firstly on inflation, and secondly, on growth to which I will now turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will then consider the relevance of such effects for the monetary policy of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.73,0)">Taxes and inflation The impact of taxation on inflation  ) Let me start with the impact of taxation and changes in tax rates on the price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And let me start with the example of direct taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.01,0)">Direct taxes affect both the demand for and supply of goods, capital and labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.66,0)">On the supply side, a profit tax, for example, reduces a firm’s net profit margin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.8,0)">Similarly, a payroll tax, in the form of employer social security contributions, raises the cost of labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.74,0)">This is the direct effect of the tax changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.43,0)">But the extent to which companies pass on these costs to consumers in terms of higher consumer prices depends on the business environment in which they operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.9,0)">And this environment determines other, indirect effects, of the tax changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.05,0)">If companies are able to maintain their net profit margins, tax increases on profits or labour will result in higher prices for consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.23,0)">By contrast, prices may remain largely unaffected if firms accept a decline in their net profit margins or if they are able to pass on the higher tax burden to their workers in the form of a relative wage reduction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">On the demand side, changes in direct taxes such as income tax or capital gains tax have the direct effect of reducing disposable income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.31,0)">This typically reduces the demand for goods and services, putting downward pressure on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.6,0)">But again, the extent to which this actually happens depends on indirect effects stemming from the economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">If wage negotiations focus on net wages and the bargaining power of labour is strong, then workers may be able to shift part of the additional tax burden on to employers, who may in turn attempt to raise prices to maintain profit margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.02,0)">What about indirect taxes such as VAT or excise duties?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.63,0)">Changes in such taxes usually have a direct and immediate impact on the gross price of the affected goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.99,0)">But again the overall effect on consumer prices may turn out to be more or less than that implied by the increased duty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Workers may succeed in shifting part of the tax burden onto employers through higher wages, which may induce further price increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.79,0)">Alternatively, producers could reduce net prices to compensate for part of the tax increase by reducing profit margins, which would imply a less than proportional effect of indirect tax increases on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.6,0)">Empirical evidence  ) Given the multiplicity of theoretical transmission channels, assessing the inflationary impact of tax changes is essentially an empirical question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In recent years a number of researchers have attempted to address this question using VAR models including output, interest rates, the price level and fiscal policy variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For the most part, these models have tended to show only a very limited impact of tax shocks on inflation in developed economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.9,0)">However, it should be noted that these models generally do not distinguish between different categories of taxation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.98,0)">Thus they may not capture all relevant effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.71,0)">To address this shortcoming, macroeconomic models can be used to simulate the impact of tax changes on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Such models generally have Keynesian characteristics in the short run while showing classical long run behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Generally, according to these models, changes in direct taxes have a very small or negligible impact on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">By contrast, changes in indirect taxes and employers’ social security contributions have a relatively large impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.37,0)">In addition, the effect on prices usually appears to take some time to materialise fully.  )</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.57,0)">The following table shows the results of estimations using macroeconomic models of the ECB and OECD for the euro area, and of the Bank of Spain and the European Commission for Spain, that were reported in a recent ECB working paper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">It can be seen that a 1% change in indirect taxes is estimated to have a much greater effect than a 1% change in direct taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Moreover, in the ECB and Bank of Spain models, the cumulative effect of the tax changes is greater after two years than after just one year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.57,0)">While measuring the total impact of changes in tax rates on prices is a complex modelling exercise, calculations of the direct impact of changes in indirect taxes on the price level are relatively straightforward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.57,0)">As a rough indication, in recent years, the effect of increases in indirect tax rates on annual HICP inflation has been in the order of 0.2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The broader context of fiscal policy  ) As I stated earlier, it is my intention today to limit my considerations to the revenue side of the government’s balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.83,0)">But I cannot completely ignore the role of government spending and the overall fiscal balance in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.1,0)">In the short run, the total impact of tax policy measures on aggregate demand results from the combination of both private and public demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.65,0)">Thus, if a tax increase that has a negative impact on private demand is used to finance higher government spending   the aggregate effect on prices may be either positive or negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.0,0)">The direction and size of this effect will depend on the respective elasticities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.42,0)">Moreover, private agents’ reactions to tax changes depend, among other things, on their perception of the sustainability of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">For example, under normal circumstances, a tax cut is expected to stimulate private demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.23,0)">But if households expect that income tax reductions will have to be reversed in the near future to ensure fiscal sustainability, they may choose to save some of the additional disposable income rather than raise consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The stimulatory effect of a tax cut might therefore be quite limited in countries with fiscal imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.1,0)">The impact of inflation on taxation We should also not forget that the causal relationship between taxation runs in both directions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.79,0)">In many case tax rates apply to nominal values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.64,0)">As a consequence, price changes affect the amount of taxes paid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Higher prices for consumer goods translate directly into higher nominal VAT obligations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Higher wages imply higher income tax receipts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Moreover, under progressive tax schedules the proportional rise in income tax is likely to be greater than that in wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.18,0)">This is because if income thresholds are fixed in nominal terms some wage earners are pushed into higher tax brackets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.32,0)">In this way, high inflation is liable to introduce or exacerbate distortions in the economy created by taxation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">And one of the benefits of reducing inflation rates is to reduce such distortions .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.44,0)">In fact inflation can be considered as a form of taxation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.53,0)">The creation of money beyond what is needed to finance transactions imposes a real tax on the holders of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.87,0)">And the inflation tax is arguably the most disruptive of all taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.37,0)">It is a tax that arbitrarily redistributes income from savers to borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.32,0)">A tax that is paid most by more vulnerable members of society who are less able to protect themselves by investing in indexed financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And it is also a tax that is extremely difficult to reduce, as the experience of many countries in the past century has shown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.5,0)">Preventing the re-emergence of the inflation tax and thereby protecting peoples real incomes is the raison d’être of independent central banks such as the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But before delving too deeply into the monetary policy implications of taxation, let me turn to the relationship between taxation and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Taxation and growth Taxes and determinants of growth  ) In the early literature on economic growth, population increases and technological progress alone determined the long-term growth rate of output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.45,0)">Economic policy could affect the equilibrium level of output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">It could do this, for example, by raising the return on capital investment or labour supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But economic policy could not influence the long-run growth rate of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Growth was exogenous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">More recent endogenous growth literature has introduced a role for economic policy in explaining long-term growth rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">It has done this by introducing additional determinants of growth such as a knowledge-producing sector, by defining capital in a broad way to include human capital and knowledge spillovers, or by assuming that capital accumulation has large positive externalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Investment in one sector can have positive spillover effects on the productivity of human and physical capital in other sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">For example, investment in computers in one firm allows the dissemination of computer literacy and may promote the use of computers in other firms and sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.7,0)">When growth is endogenous, the level and structure of taxes can affect the determinants of long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">In particular, changes in taxes that increase the net returns on investment in human or physical capital, on research and development, or on labour can raise the natural growth rate of output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Human capital accumulation is typically seen as being at the core of economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Highly qualified workers are necessary for countries to develop and benefit from new technologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But the extent to which people invest in their own human capital depends on the expected rate of return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.15,0)">Higher marginal taxes on labour reduce the expected return on human capital and may therefore discourage investment in education and skills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.63,0)">Similarly, as far as companies are concerned, higher corporate income taxation reduces the net return on capital and thus discourages physical capital accumulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In an increasingly global economy, such considerations are becoming increasingly important for decisions regarding the location of foreign direct investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.84,0)">Tax regimes also have an impact on technological progress by the way in which they affect incentives for enterprises to invest in research and development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.66,0)">Empirical evidence in industrial market economies suggests that private investment in research and development in most countries is currently below the optimum level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">In some countries, this is being addressed by introducing tax relief targeted specifically at research and development activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">At least as important as the impact of taxation on capital formation and technological progress is the impact of taxation on employment decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.17,0)">Labour taxes, including social security contributions, raise labour costs and drive a wedge between gross and net wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.79,0)">This has the effect of reducing equilibrium employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In this context it is important to widen the focus beyond the narrow definition of labour taxes and assess the incentive effect of the entire tax benefit system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.96,0)">For the decision to supply labour, what matters is the combined effect of taxes on labour and the alternative unemployment benefit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.08,0)">It has been shown that for some unemployed people the marginal effective tax rate of moving back into employment can even exceed 100%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.54,0)">This means that by taking up work the respective worker actually reduces his net income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.06,0)">Such perverse incentives apply in particular for low skilled workers Another area where the combined effect of the tax and benefits system is of particular importance is the retirement decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.51,0)">For a worker deciding whether to retire now or to continue working for one more year, the relevant criterion is his expected after-tax income from working, adjusted to take into account foregone benefits in terms of pension income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In several European countries retirement systems still provide an incentive to retire early by penalising longer working lives through high effective tax rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In many cases this reflects the attempt to push older workers into early retirement with a view to raising the demand for younger workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.93,0)">But such policies raise the burden on social security and thus on labour taxation, reducing overall employment and thereby potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.84,0)">Beyond affecting the steady state growth rate of the economy, the level and structure of taxes may also have an impact on growth by affecting the economy’s capability to absorb shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.69,0)">This is because taxes that reduce the markets ability to equilibrate prices and quantities in response to a change in the economic environment make the economy’s adjustment to the new situation more protracted and costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.12,0)">Take the example of a stamp duty for real estate transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.0,0)">If set at a high level, such a duty will reduce the liquidity of the housing market thereby also impeding regional labour mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.62,0)">The combined effect of tax and benefits systems can also impede economic adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.36,0)">Suppose high income taxes and generous unemployment benefits result in high marginal tax rates on returning to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.6,0)">This provides a disincentive, not only to take up new work, but also to retrain where necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.63,0)">The average period spent in unemployment will increase and human capital will be eroded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.91,0)">What was at first a cyclical increase in unemployment may, as a result become at least partly structural in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Role of tax reforms  ) If taxation can influence long run growth, the obvious question is what kind of tax reforms should be introduced to raise growth potential?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.98,0)">As I have already said, almost all taxes distort relative prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">From this perspective, reforms that lower tax rates should generally reduce distortions in the economy and thus contribute to the efficient allocation of resources and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">But at the same time taxation is needed to finance public expenditure, which itself is intended to achieve economic and social objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.97,0)">As a central banker I would not wish to enter into an argument about the appropriate size of government in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">But it is a fact that revenue and expenditure ratios in the euro area are for the most part rather high by international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This could be an indication that, at least in some countries, there may be scope for reducing these ratios in a way that allows tax cuts and benefits growth without endangering broader policy objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">But the more pertinent question in my view is how can distortions arising from the tax system be reduced for any given overall level of taxation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I consider three elements to be important in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">First, a tax system should be as broad-based as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">For a given level of revenue, targeting broad aggregates can provide scope for lowering tax distortions by reducing average and marginal tax rates on individual taxable items.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Broad tax bases drawing on relatively stable macroeconomic aggregates also reduce revenue volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This lowers the risk of unpleasant fiscal surprises and can provide the government with more fiscal room for manoeuvre in economically difficult times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Second, there is a need to foster tax compliance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is a point that has attracted relatively little attention in public finance literature until recently but is of huge practical importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">To this end, taxes need to be efficient in the sense that compliance can be monitored and, where necessary, enforced at low cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Transparency and simplicity of the fiscal code are key requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.66,0)">By contrast, complex and intransparent tax laws drive up compliance costs and invite tax evasion and tax avoidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.91,0)">In this same vein, frequent changes to the tax code increase tax uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.62,0)">They may also induce investors to postpone investments - or make them abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And third, the tax system has to be as fair as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.58,0)">Fairness is an objective that is frequently cited by policy-makers and an issue that economists usually prefer to avoid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In keeping with the economists tradition I shall not delve too deeply into the issue of fairness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Nonetheless, two remarks seem worth making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">The first is that the previous two elements that I have mentioned, namely a broad-based and a simple and transparent tax system will most likely go a long way to ensuring a system that is also seen to be fair.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.73,0)">The second is that a tax system that is de jure progressive and therefore often deemed to be fair can de facto turn out to be regressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.26,0)">This is the case if, for example, high marginal tax rates discourage low income people from taking up work or increasing their working hours, giving rise to so-called unemployment and poverty traps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Situation in Europe  ) So where does Europe stand with respect to taxation and tax reform?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And how does it compare with other industrialised economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">There is no doubt, as I already mentioned, that overall tax burdens in many EU countries are high by international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">According to the OECD, average tax revenue in the EU in 2002 represented more than 40% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This figure is more than 10% of GDP higher than the one for the US and Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">What is even more startling is that way in which the tax burden has increased in Europe over the past few decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.65,0)">In 1960, the average ratio of revenue to GDP in euro area countries was around 27%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.07,0)">This was exactly the same figure as in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Since then, the average ratio of revenue to GDP among the countries of the euro area has risen to around 45%, while that of the United States has increased by much less, to just above 30%.  )</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.63,0)">This relatively high tax burden also seems to give rise to the distortions one would expect in terms of high marginal tax rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.25,0)">For example, the combined marginal rate of personal income tax and employee social security contributions for low skilled workers amounted to more than 37% in 2003 for the EU compared to 29% for the US and just 19% for Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.4,0)">The legal retirement age in most EU countries is 65.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.08,0)">But the average age at which workers effectively leave the labour market is much lower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.41,0)">According to the European Commission, in 2002 the average effective retirement age was just 61 for the EU15.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.31,0)">Furthermore, it has declined over the past few decades even as life expectancy has increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This behaviour has to do at least partly with high implicit tax rates on continuing work beyond the legal minimum thresholds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The OECD estimates that, for EU countries, the average implicit tax on working beyond the age of 60 exceeds 50%  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.55,0)">This is seen as explaining the very low employment rate for older workers in the EU, which for people aged between 55 and 64 is little over 40%  compared with close to 60% for the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.03,0)">I would not claim that there is conclusive proof of high tax rates necessarily leading to low growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Nonetheless, the following charts make interesting reading.  )</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.76,0)">The first shows a regression of changes in the employment ratio on changes in direct taxes for OECD countries over the period from 1960 to 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.47,0)">While clearly such a simple regression does not say anything about causation, the fact is that there is a statistically significant negative relationship between changes in direct taxes and employment ratios.  )</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.23,0)">This second chart shows a regression of changes in capital formation on changes in direct taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.37,0)">Once again, a statistically significant, negative relationship is found.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Once again, while not wishing read too much into such relationships, in my view they should at least provide us with food for thought.  )</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">So overall it seems that there is significant scope for growth enhancing tax reform in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">And indeed recently we have started to see reforms that go in the right direction, in the context of the EU’s Lisbon Strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">France has taken steps to reduce the tax wedge, in particular for low skilled labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Germany has recently undertaken a reform of its tax and benefits system with a view to stimulating employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">France and Austria have introduced reforms to their tax and benefit systems aimed at reducing the incentives for early retirement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Some countries have even introduced or are considering the introduction of flat rate income taxes, which represents quite a radical approach to minimising tax distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">So there is progress in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.29,0)">But I would still say that the overall speed of reform is slow and in many countries a lot of issues and problems are still to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Also we have to bear in mind the overall fiscal consequences of tax reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.15,0)">In some countries tax reforms have reduced tax revenue without a matching reduction of expenditure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.42,0)">The result in some cases has been to introduce or exacerbate budgetary imbalances that now need to be corrected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Thus, it is important to recall that if tax cuts are to be sustainable and to contribute to raising growth in the long-run, they need to be financed by equivalent reductions on the expenditure side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">As a central banker, I would also stress the importance of appropriately timing tax reforms from a cyclical point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.48,0)">There may be cases where even if a tax reform were to be desirable from a long-term perspective and affordable as far as the government’s fiscal position is concerned, if not timed properly it could still have a detrimental pro-cyclical effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.81,0)">A reduction of the overall tax burden that raises disposable income and hence consumption could exacerbate inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">In the context of Economic and Monetary Union, this would also increase the inflation differential vis-à-vis other euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.56,0)">And the ECB’s single monetary policy, which by definition has a euro area wide focus, can do nothing to address such differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Taxation and the ECB’s monetary policy To recapitulate, taxation and tax reforms have an important bearing on macroeconomic outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.31,0)">Via their impact on relative prices and rates of return on different activities, changes in tax rates affect the aggregate price level in the short run and can also influence the long-term growth rate of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But how to do changes in tax rates and tax reforms influence the ECB’s monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.48,0)">How and to what extent are they taken into account in the ECB’s monetary policy decisions?  )</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To answer this question, it is important to start by highlighting the main features of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The first element of this strategy is a quantitative definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Specifically, the ECB aims to maintain inflation rates at below but close to 2% over the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Secondly, the ECB’s monetary policy decisions are based on a comprehensive analysis of the risks to price stability, compromising of both an economic analysis and a monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The economic analysis focuses mainly on the assessment of current economic and financial developments and the implied short to medium-term risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.45,0)">Such risks stem primarily from the interplay between the supply and demand in goods, services and factors at those horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Meanwhile the monetary analysis involves carefully monitoring the development of monetary aggregates, their components and their counterparts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The monetary analysis reflects our conviction that, in the long-term, inflation is a monetary phenomenon and hence serves mainly to identify longer-term risks to price stability.  )</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">So how are taxes and tax reforms taken into account in this strategy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Firstly, the short to medium-term impact of changes in tax rates on inflation are assessed in the context of the ECB’s economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">I mentioned earlier, for example, that in recent years, increases in indirect taxes are estimated to have contributed in the order of 0.2% to annual increases of the HICP index.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.63,0)">But even if changes in tax rates are observed to have an impact on the price level in the short term, this does not trigger a mechanical reaction on the part of the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">As is made clear by our quantitative definition of price stability, what matters is whether or not such changes pose risks to price stability “over the medium-term”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.4,0)">It is important to understand that the economy is continuously subject to all kinds of largely unforeseeable shocks, such as oil price hikes, bad weather, or natural disasters that affect price developments in the short-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.85,0)">But monetary policy can only affect price developments with a considerable time lag.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.51,0)">It does not therefore make sense for monetary policy to attempt to fine-tune price developments at short-horizons in response to such shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.69,0)">Not only would such an attempt be futile, it would also impose an unnecessary cost on the economy by raising output volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.1,0)">In this vein, it would not be appropriate for monetary policy to react to short-term price level movements stemming from adjustments of tax rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Instead, monetary policy needs to carefully monitor the extent to which such changes may eventually translate into longer-term inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.9,0)">This depends largely on the extent and persistence of so-called “second round effects”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">To what extent will, say, an increase in the price level due to indirect tax increases fuel longer-term inflationary pressures by feeding into wage settlements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.53,0)">If higher consumer prices feed into higher wages and vice-versa, this could lead to an inflationary spiral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.73,0)">Such effects will be determined to a large extent by the structure of the economy, by the wage bargaining mechanism, the degree of competition in product markets, or the flexibility of the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Also crucial in this respect is the role played by the formation of expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">In principle, an increase in, say, indirect taxes, the direct impact of which is a one-off increase in the price level, should not give rise to expectations of higher inflation over the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.34,0)">However, expectations could be affected if this one-off increase is repeated or if it is preceded or followed by other upwards price shocks that together give rise to higher inflation over a certain period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.42,0)">In such a case, higher inflation which is essentially due to a series of temporary events could be misinterpreted as being of a more structural nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The ECB has an important role to play in preventing such a scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Through its communication policy, the ECB seeks, among other things, to carefully explain the nature of short-term price movements and to reassure economic agents of its commitment to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">If the ECB’s commitment to maintain price stability is credible, then in particular wage earners concerned about their real incomes should perceive less of a need to demand higher nominal wages increases in response to short-term price increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Thus, by pursuing a credible monetary policy and through effective communication, the need for monetary policy to react to short-term price movements, including those stemming from taxation, can be reduced, thereby also limiting any potentially negative impact on output in the short-term.  )</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But what about the long-term effect of tax reform on potential growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.73,0)">How might this influence the ECB’s monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.93,0)">Well, clearly the link between tax reform, potential growth and inflation is a more subtle one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Nonetheless, over the longer-term and as a key ingredient of a broader set of supply-side policies such as those embodied in the EU’s Lisbon agenda, tax reforms could have a bearing on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Take the example of a tax reform that lowers marginal income tax rates and, as a consequence, raises the equilibrium employment rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">During an economic upturn, such a reform would help to reduce inflationary pressures stemming from the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.33,0)">All other things equal, this could imply less of a need for monetary policy tightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In general, supply-side reforms which raise potential growth by creating a more flexible economy that is better able to withstand and adjust to shocks also facilitate the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In a more flexible economy, the impact of shocks   on both output and inflation are likely to be both more subdued and short-lived.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This in turn, allows monetary policy to react less strongly to these shocks than would otherwise be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">A more dynamic economic environment is also likely to translate into a better response of the economy to monetary policy impulses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.04,0)">But it should be clear that a central bank such as the ECB that is entrusted with maintaining the real value of citizens’ incomes must be very cautious in making assumptions about the trend growth of the economy and the ability of the economy to respond to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.32,0)">Announcements of economic policies or reforms that are intended to increase flexibility and raise growth rates are a seemingly frequent occurrence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Clear and lasting improvements in economic performance, especially at the euro area wide level, are somewhat rarer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Monetary policy must be formulated on the basis of hard evidence and not just good intentions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusions   Ladies and gentlemen, It is time for me to conclude, and I would do so as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Central banks, including the ECB, have a keen interest - if not an obsession - with public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This is rightly so given the size of the government sector, especially in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Today, I have limited myself to considering the ECB’s interest in just one side of the government balance sheet, namely the revenue side, and more specifically taxation and tax reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.57,0)">While the central banker’s main interest may be in the balance between taxation and expenditure  , taxation on its own can also have implications for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.64,0)">Firstly, changes in tax rates can affect the price level in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Provided that the impact on inflation is temporary, this should not require a reaction from a monetary policy with a medium-term orientation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">However, changes in tax rates can, at least potentially, give rise to longer term risks to price stability due to “second round effects”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is mainly these second round effects that monetary policy makers need to monitor carefully and be ready to react to if necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Secondly, tax structures are relevant in determining the long-term growth potential of the economy, including the capacity of the economy to adjust to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">In Europe, high tax ratios and marginal tax rate suggest that there is considerable scope for tax reform as part of a broader policy of structural reforms aimed at raising growth rates in the context of the Lisbon Strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">If successful, such reforms would facilitate the conduct of monetary policy by helping to contain inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.09,0)">However, a central bank has to be cautious in evaluating the impact of such reforms and always base its policy decisions on rigorous analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">King, M., “Commentary: Monetary Policy
