    <h3> Speaker: Luis de Guindos </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)"> Frankfurt am Main, 16 December 2019 Welcome remarks Remarks by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the fourth annual ECB macroprudential policy and research conference I am delighted to welcome you all to the fourth annual ECB macroprudential policy and research conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This conference is held annually to ensure that we meet regularly and advance our understanding of macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This year’s focus is on monetary policy and financial stability as it represents the conclusion of the ECB’s Research Task Force dedicated to this topic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In my remarks today I will cover three aspects of macroprudential policy and research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">First, I will reflect on the economic and financial conditions that may represent challenges for macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Second, I will focus on selected achievements at the ECB in advancing the research frontier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Finally, I will address the need of rebalancing capital requirements towards releasable buffers to allow macroprudential authorities to act more effectively in a countercyclical manner especially in adverse economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.48,0)">Macroprudential policy in a changing environment The current environment is characterised by a weakening of the macroeconomic outlook and increasing uncertainty, even though the latest indicators point to a stabilisation of economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.22,0)">The associated low-for-longer interest rate environment is likely to put pressure on bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.28,0)">Weak profitability and squeezed margins pose a risk to financial stability as they may hamper banks’ intermediation and capital generation capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It is thus important to assess the interaction of monetary and macroprudential policies while respecting their individual mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">I am happy to say that quite some research on the interaction of these two policy areas has been undertaken here at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In particular, two papers of the Research Task Force are dedicated to this issue: one documents the macroeconomic impact of macroprudential policy measures and its interaction with monetary policy ; a second one sheds light and quantifies the transmission between monetary policy and bank stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">On-going research at the ECB Moreover, ECB research has showcased the particular importance of remaining vigilant about banks’ resilience in episodes of increasing cyclical systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.59,0)">Recent work quantifies how exuberant credit and asset price dynamics lead to large downside risks to bank-level return on assets, putting a banking system’s capital at risk over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The quantification of bank capital at risk can support the calibration of macroprudential instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">In turn, by subjecting the banking sector to specific shocks, a macroprudential stress-testing framework can help in assessing the capital shortfall in times of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.83,0)">Whereas traditional stress-testing frameworks focus on initial capital shortfalls, macroprudential stress-testing frameworks quantify the propagation of costs for banks and the real economy over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is the aim of the macro-micro approach, which takes into account the heterogeneity in banks’ reaction functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">More generally, stress-testing has become a key instrument in the macroprudential and financial stability toolkit for assessing risks to the banking system in adverse conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The bottom-up approach used in the context of the EU-wide stress test relies on banks’ own reporting of projections based on common scenarios and gives national supervisors and the ECB an important role with regard to quality assurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Recent research provides tentative evidence that “supervisory scrutiny” relating to quality assurance has a disciplining effect on banks’ risk-taking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">We also need to understand how banks will react to the policy measures that are applied to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">A dynamic micro-founded structural model of bank behaviour examines changes in capital and liquidity requirements and confirms considerable heterogeneity among banks’ reactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Moreover, our 3D model, with default modelled in the household, non-financial corporations and banking sector, has been successfully used in various policy exercises and exemplifies how cutting-edge research can help inform policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.88,0)">The role of macroprudential policy So what is the role of macroprudential policy in the current environment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The financial crisis showed that macroprudential policy is needed to complement supervisory scrutiny by accounting for system-wide macro-financial feedback loops.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Macroprudential policy is called to act countercyclically, tightening requirements when we see excessive risk-taking and loosening them to avoid a credit crunch when risks materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Since the crisis, the resilience of euro area banks has improved significantly and their capital level is currently considered to be adequate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">However, in addition to the level of capital, also its composition deserves appropriate consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">The macroprudential buffers that are currently implemented in the SSM banking system are of a predominantly structural nature and are thus expected to be maintained over the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The countercyclical capital buffer   is the only buffer that is intended to be released in case of a downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.36,0)">However, the CCyB has only been activated by seven of the 19 euro area countries and currently represents, in the aggregate, only 0.1% of risk-weighted assets   A lack of releasable buffers curbs the countercyclical role of macroprudential authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">When breaching their combined buffer requirements, banks may uphold capital ratios by disposing assets to avoid the automatic restrictions on dividend distributions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.69,0)">If such behaviour becomes widespread in the event of systemic stress, it can result in a credit crunch, which would aggravate the downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is exactly what we observed in previous crisis episodes, and what we should avoid in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Macroprudential space in the form of releasable buffers could serve as a potential macro-financial stabilisation in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The release of the buffers in a downturn should help banks to sustain the flow of credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">To this end, releasable buffers would first need to be available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In sum, we are in a situation where the overall level of capital requirements is broadly adequate, but the composition may not be optimal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">It is therefore important to have a discussion on the need to reallocate capital requirements towards releasable buffers in a capital-neutral manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Other national authorities have had – or are having – similar discussions, such as in the United Kingdom and in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">To me, such a reallocation appears to make sense in the current environment of heightened uncertainty and risks tilted to the downside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">With a reallocation of buffers, cyclical systemic risk factors – common to the entire banking sector – would be covered appropriately by the CCyB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In turn, remaining idiosyncratic bank-specific risks will continue to be covered by microprudential requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">The reallocation would be capital-neutral because the resulting increase in the CCyB would be offset by a corresponding decrease in other capital requirements, for example in Pillar 2, as done by the Bank of England.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The capital-neutral creation of releasable buffers does not require a regulatory change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Indeed, the CCyB is already enshrined in EU law and transposed in the national context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It is used to address cyclical systemic risks that are common to the entire banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">To ensure that all relevant risks in the banking sector continue to be appropriately covered calls for continued close cooperation among all relevant authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">This includes close coordination both among micro- and macroprudential authorities as well as between the ECB and national macroprudential authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">National authorities will continue to remain first in line to deploy the CCyB to address changing systemic risks in their jurisdiction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Concluding remarks Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.05,0)">The current macro-financial environment has become more challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.16,0)">The lower-for-longer interest rate environment creates strains on bank profitability with implications for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">This implies that we need to further build our analytical toolkit to identify risks and devise a coherent policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">It calls for intensifying both our outreach to state-of-the-art research from academia and our analytical work in-house.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">As mentioned earlier, deepening our understanding on the interplay between monetary and macroprudential policies is a key priority in a low-for-longer interest rate environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Furthermore, we aim at better capturing interactions between banks, other market participants and the real economy in a fully integrated macroprudential stress-testing framework combining macro and micro building blocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This requires estimating and modelling behaviour of financial and non-financial agents to realistically capture their balance sheet adjustments also in times of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">On the policy side, our key priority is to become more agile in fulfilling our countercyclical macroprudential policy mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">We need to ensure that releasable buffers are available to enable the banking system to support the real economy in a downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">At present, the best option is to set the CCyB in a capital-neutral manner to be able to withstand current headwinds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">I wish us all an insightful conference.</span><span style="background-color:
