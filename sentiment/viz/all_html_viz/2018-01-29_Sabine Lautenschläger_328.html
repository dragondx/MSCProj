    <span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)"> Basel III - sense and sensitivity Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Institute for Law and Finance Conference on Basel III, Frankfurt am Main, 29 January 2018 It is done: Basel III has been finalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">I admit that it was a long journey, but in my view, it was worth the wait: Basel III will help to make banking safer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">It is crucial, though, that Basel III is properly implemented – in Europe and around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.65,0)">It must not be watered down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Basel III marks the end of the post-crisis reforms; regulatory certainty has been restored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The banks know what awaits them; they can be confident about the regulatory framework, and can plan ahead and support the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">But does Basel III deliver what was promised?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Does it, on the one hand, create rules which are sufficiently risk-sensitive to set the right incentives for banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And does it, on the other hand, create rules which are simple enough to decrease model risk?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.75,0)">Banks are not enchanted by Basel III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.69,0)">Many of them claim that it throws risk sensitivity overboard and penalises low risk exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.49,0)">Are these claims justified?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Well, we have not thrown risk sensitivity overboard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.56,0)">And why would we?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Risk sensitivity helps align capital requirements with actual levels of risk and supports an efficient capital allocation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It prevents arbitrage and risk shifting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">And risk-sensitive rules promote sound risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.23,0)">But we all know how challenging it is to measure and model risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.72,0)">Much depends on the quality of the models; much depends on the data and the assumptions that feed into those models; and much depends on supervisors’ capacity to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.53,0)">If there are errors along the way, banks might end up undercapitalised and vulnerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.21,0)">This, in turn, might lead markets to question the reliability of risk-based capital requirements in general, which would undermine trust in banks more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Therefore we need to balance risk sensitivity with some safeguards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And this is exactly what we aim to do with Basel III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">It preserves risk sensitivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It retains internal models for most asset classes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">And it enhances the risk sensitivity of the standardised approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">But at the same time, Basel III adds a few safeguards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">First, I think we can all agree that it makes no sense to allow for more complex risk-sensitive capital requirements if risks cannot be measured and modelled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Basel III therefore aligns the degree of risk sensitivity with the extent to which it is possible to measure and model risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Second, there are some more conservative haircuts on collateral and some input floors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.89,0)">These input floors lie beneath the parameters for “probability of default” and “loss given default”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And there will be floors beneath the “exposure at default” calculation as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.54,0)">These floors work bottom-up; they will keep banks from feeding their internal models with excessively low inputs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This serves as a safeguard as it prevents capital requirements from being set too low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">And, yes, these input floors make the rules a bit less risk-sensitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">But we need to look at this in absolute terms – for residential mortgages, the input floor increases from three basis points to five basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.7,0)">Five basis points correspond to a once-in-2,000 years default rate!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.87,0)">Is such a floor really too conservative?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">At global level, the bottom-up reforms see small increases in capital for exposures to other banks, large corporates and equity investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">This is somewhat offset by a reduction in risk weights for loans to small and medium-sized enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.81,0)">Third, there is the hotly debated output floor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It ensures that risk-weighted assets calculated with internal models do not fall too far below those calculated with standardised approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.65,0)">“Too far below” means they must reach at least 72.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.99,0)">Does that kill risk sensitivity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.61,0)">No, it does not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Obviously, there is still room for banks to apply individual risk weights and to benefit from lower capital requirements for classic, low-risk banking business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.69,0)">And more than that: the effective floor might even be lower than 72.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This is due to the fact that many banks apply the standardised approaches to at least some exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.24,0)">This implies that, depending on the share of assets still under the standardised approach, the effective floor for them could be lower than 72.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">At the same time, Basel III makes the standardised approaches themselves more risk-sensitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.87,0)">Let me give you just one example: residential mortgages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Under Basel II, the standardised approach assigned the same risk weight to almost all such mortgages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.87,0)">But in Basel III, the risk weights of residential mortgages depend on the loan-to-value ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.92,0)">The output floor is thus set in relation to a benchmark, which itself has become more risk-sensitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.21,0)">And let us not forget that, in some cases, the standardised approaches have become less costly in terms of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">At global level, the capital requirements from standardised approaches have been reduced by about 2% on average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.27,0)">Mortgages and corporate lending make up the majority of these reductions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">So, Basel III does keep risk sensitivity on board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It acknowledges, though, that there are limits to internal models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">It provides safeguards to restore trust in risk-based capital requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Does this mean that Basel III is the perfect standard – the philosopher’s stone of banking regulation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Well, Basel III is a global standard, and across the world, financial sectors differ greatly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Just think of real estate financing and how differently it is treated in Europe compared with the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.26,0)">Thus, a global standard cannot suit everyone perfectly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.89,0)">The key is to find an acceptable compromise; the alternative would be to have no global standard, and that would definitely be worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.51,0)">The output floor in particular is one such compromise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.89,0)">What impact will the final Basel III package have on banks – and on their business models and their capital?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The rules are not neutral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.26,0)">The bottom-up safeguards in Basel III, including the input floors, will impact on risk weights in some business areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.07,0)">Certain retail credit card exposures are one example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.47,0)">The top-down output floor affects overall capital requirements, depending on the overall portfolio composition of a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">For example, our analysis suggests that the difference between internal ratings-based and standardised risk weights tends to be relatively large in certain segments of real-estate markets where historical loss rates are exceptionally low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.75,0)">The output floor tends to be more binding for banks which are heavily engaged in these markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Overall, it is hard to predict how business models will evolve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This depends not only on regulation, but also on many other factors, including the future path of profitability in different business areas, the pricing power of banks and, eventually, how banks will adapt their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.44,0)">Now what about additional capital requirements?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.22,0)">What about the banks’ claim that the burden might be too heavy for them?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Well, there are two things to bear in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">First, there will be a long transition period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">This is at the heart of the overall compromise which paved the way for finalising Basel III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This transition period runs right through to 2027.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It gives banks and legislators time to implement all the changes introduced by Basel III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.68,0)">Second, the European Banking Authority estimates that, for EU banks, the final Basel III package will lead to an aggregate Tier 1 capital shortfall of €34.4 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.78,0)">Is that a lot?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.89,0)">In 2016, the largest banks in the euro area earned €50 billion – net, after taxes, and in a difficult environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.45,0)">Also, the capital shortfall refers to the end of the transition period, which is nine years away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Most banks should be able to earn their way out of potential shortfalls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">To sum up, Basel III preserves risk sensitivity in a sensible way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">At the same time, banks will be able to handle its impact and, in the long run, they too will benefit from a more stable banking system.</span>
