    <span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)"> The housing finance markets and EMU Speech delivered by Dr. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the Annual General Meeting of the European Mortgage Federation on 6 November 1998 in Brussels Introduction I should like to thank you for inviting the European Central Bank to this Conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">The Conference offers an excellent opportunity to assess the developments which could occur in the special segment of the financial market represented by housing finance as a result of the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Developments in the field of housing finance are of great importance, in the first instance, for the banking systems and households, since it is a field which accounts for a major proportion of credit institutions' assets and for the bulk of private households' debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">However, the issues involved are of considerable interest also to central banks, including the European Central Bank, because the level of indebtedness and mortgage interest rates as well as other terms and conditions of housing loans are among the key factors which influence the responsiveness of the household sector to monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">In general, it is widely recognised that the introduction of the euro, together with the single market legislation relating to financial services, provides an opportunity to create a more competitive and efficient banking industry, as well as more integrated and liquid capital markets in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Indeed, competition has already increased considerably in several areas of the financial system as a result of a number of fundamental driving forces for change - internationalisation, technological progress, diversification of savings portfolios - to name but a few.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">However, the introduction of the euro is likely to act as a catalyst for these changes, speeding up the emergence of a genuine single market for financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">There is, of course, a great deal of uncertainty involved, since only time will tell how financial institutions will respond strategically to the opportunities and challenges brought about by the euro, and how customers and investors will change their behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In terms of its timing and effects, the impact of the euro will probably vary significantly across different types of financial services and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The segment of the financial system that is being addressed at this Conference - housing finance - is an integral part of retail banking where, at the risk of oversimplification, the impact of the euro is likely to be more gradual than in other areas of financial activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">In this respect, the basic question which I should like to address today is whether the euro can be expected to lead to a significant integration of the national housing finance markets in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">So far, these have in fact remained largely segmented to the extent that activities are still conducted predominantly by domestic institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In addressing this issue, I intend to proceed as follows: after recalling the main trends in and features of the housing finance markets in the EU, I will attempt to highlight what I believe to be the most likely effects of the euro with respect to lowering the barriers to entry in this specific sector and to offer some conclusions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Discernible trends in and features of housing finance Without presuming to identify all relevant trends and features, the EU housing finance market might, in summary, be said to have been characterised by three main developments in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">First, there has been a general tendency for mortgage lending to increase overall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Over the past ten years, outstanding mortgage loans for residential property have more than doubled in most European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">In some countries  , the increase has been even more marked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The underlying factors behind these developments are the improvements in living standards which have raised the quality of the required dwellings, the stability of the macro-economic environment and, in particular over the past few years, the decline in interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Mortgage lending continued to expand significantly in many European countries in 1997, namely by about 2.5% in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.07,0)">However, many structural features of the property markets, such as the level of owner occupation, continue to influence the scope of lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.57,0)">The ratio of mortgage loans to the gross domestic product   still varies across EU countries, ranging from over 50% in Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to below 10% in Greece and Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Second, there has been steady growth in the volume of outstanding mortgage bonds used as a form of funding over the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">However, the extent to which institutions resort to capital markets varies substantially across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Countries with dedicated mortgage credit institutions also tend to have relatively deep mortgage bond markets, as these institutions finance their fixed-rate lending by issuing fixed-rate bonds to match their interest rate exposure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This holds true, in particular, of Denmark and Sweden and, albeit to a lesser degree, of Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In other countries, retail savings tend to be the most important means of funding as banks or mutual institutions act as intermediaries for most of the mortgage loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Third, despite common trends, historically developed contractual and institutional differences still largely prevail across countries, if the current situation is compared with that of, say, a decade ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.2,0)">In particular, many aspects of housing finance have remained closely linked to national regulations  , national taxation  , and national subsidies as well as to administrative procedures that thwart or even discriminate against cross-border operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.98,0)">These differences make it difficult or, occasionally, impossible to develop standard "pan-European" products or capital market instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">It should be acknowledged, however, that the European Commission has been active in developing common consumer protection standards in order to enhance the single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.59,0)">The lack of familiarity with the specific conditions of national markets is likely to be another major reason why the markets for housing finance have remained localised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">From the borrower's perspective, caution with respect to foreign institutions may partly be explained by the sheer size of the loan required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.69,0)">From the lender's perspective, the inadequate familiarity with national features of the market gives local institutions a competitive edge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Segmentation in the EU housing finance market has persisted despite the fact that the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive has significantly lowered the legal barriers to cross-border entry by permitting institutions from any one country to operate freely in another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Against this background, one might ask what implications the introduction of the euro might have for the EU housing finance markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The euro factor: Speeding up cross-border activities In my view, there are a number of reasons to believe that the introduction of the euro will foster a further integration of the EU housing finance markets - perhaps not in the short term, but at least in the medium-term - by eliminating certain "non-legal" barriers to cross-border operations of credit institutions in this sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">To the extent that this objective is achieved, the euro would help significantly to complement single market legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In this respect, I should like to draw attention to three key aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">First, the introduction of the euro can be expected to trigger an increase in cross-border lending operations mainly because the disappearance of foreign exchange risk will reduce risks and costs for both lenders and borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">On the supply side, in particular, institutions will be able to fund their lending in another euro area country from their domestic retail deposit base or euro denominated bond markets without incurring specific foreign exchange-related risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Moreover, the expected increase in competition as a result of the introduction of the euro may compel institutions to broaden their customer base across national borders in order to spread their fixed banking costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This will take place in an environment in which technological development will likewise affect cross-border lending activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Direct banking facilities   may, in fact, increasingly allow customers to be extended credit "from a distance".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.87,0)">The need to establish a branch network - which has always been considered a major barrier for mortgage institutions wishing to enter foreign markets - would consequently lose importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">On the demand side, the interest of customers in mortgage loans offered by foreign institutions should also increase as a direct consequence of the disappearance of foreign exchange risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Such an increased interest should also stem from the enhanced comparability of prices of banking services throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">This enhanced transparency is set, in itself, to increase competition among institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Some time will be needed before customers become sufficiently aware of the new state of affairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In particular, these effects should become more pronounced when customers start to receive income in euro and become accustomed to new market conventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Second, the introduction of the euro is expected to increase the recourse to mortgage bonds as a form of funding, also on a cross-border basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In general terms, the euro will make European bond markets more attractive, since the increase in the number of issuers and investors operating in the same currency would increase the liquidity of and reduce the cost of obtaining funding from these markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The national bias is likely to diminish and funds will increasingly be managed on a wider international basis, possibly involving reallocation of existing investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Moreover, the euro will be introduced at a time when current and prospective inflation as well as nominal interest rates in the euro area are low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">In this context, the possibility of using bonds issued by credit institutions operating in the field of housing finance as collateral in ESCB monetary policy operations can enhance the liquidity of such bond issues and contribute to the development of the respective markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">These bonds may be included in the list of eligible assets if they meet the established criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The list of eligible assets is available on the ECB's Internet website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The eligibility criteria are specified in the document entitled "The Single Monetary Policy in Stage Three - General Documentation on ESCB Monetary Policy Instruments and Procedures", which is also available on the ECB's Internet website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It should be borne in mind that, so far, low liquidity   and prepayment risks   seem often to have been the biggest obstacles to the issuance of mortgage-related securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">If the euro-denominated market offers a possibility for larger issues, the liquidity obstacle would be reduced, possibly encouraging larger scale international activity in the mortgage lending business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The prepayment risk could likewise be reduced through a cross-border diversification of lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Third, the introduction of the euro represents an opportunity to broaden the use of mortgage-backed securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The issuance of these instruments has been taking place in an increasing number of EU countries, and respective changes to legislation are underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.55,0)">At the end of 1996, however, mortgage-backed securities only accounted for less than 1% of the total stock of mortgage loans in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">This is in sharp contrast to the United States where the securitisation has advanced very far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.3,0)">There are many reasons for this trend in the United States, namely the emergence of large "secondary institutions" acting as large-scale security issuers, a shortage of retail deposit funding, banks' incentives to reduce maturity mismatches and - perhaps most importantly - the existence of a deep capital market in US dollars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">For European countries, the further development of mortgage-backed securities - which is rather limited so far - could expand the use of the capital market funding as well as the range of products offered to customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Conclusions To sum up, I should like to underline three aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">First, it should be recognised that, while the integration of the EU housing finance market has been modest to date, the introduction of the euro will represent a significant opportunity to achieve further integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">From the perspective of the euro area, attempting to establish a more integrated housing finance market is a desirable objective since it would bring benefits to consumers in terms of both a wider range of products on offer and reduced costs stemming from increased competition among lenders and lending practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Whether the EU housing finance market will actually become more integrated under the influence of the euro will depend, to a certain extent, on the attitude of the institutions concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">These institutions are expected, wherever and to the extent possible, to make use of the opportunity offered by the introduction of the euro to expand beyond their own home markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Further integration will, of course, also depend on the degree to which remaining fiscal and regulatory differences across countries are eliminated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The sooner these differences can be reduced by the competent authorities, the faster will the euro have a perceptible impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Second, it should be acknowledged that the introduction of the euro will trigger substantial changes in the European capital markets by fostering an increased width and depth of these markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In general, financial institutions operating in the mortgage sector are expected further to increase their recourse to the capital market since it represents a possibility for more efficient funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">This also demands that those financial institutions which have not resorted to capital market funding so far, are invited to exploit this opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Indeed, the issuance of securities as a form of funding mortgage lending might even become a necessity, if saving shifts increasingly away from bank deposits, as has often been envisaged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This stems from the consideration that, in a more competitive environment, the option to fund cheaply is likely to become a more and more decisive factor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.39,0)">Finally, it should be pointed out that the changes in the financial landscape triggered by the introduction of the euro will bring numerous strategic challenges and risks for credit and financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.16,0)">The forecast increase in competition is also likely to affect the funding side and to reduce the share of cheap retail deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Therefore, all institutions should be aware of and prepared to adapt to changes in market conditions, fiercer competition and increasing demand for low-cost service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This will also apply to institutions operating in the mortgage sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Against this background, it is important that the adjustment takes place smoothly, without any adverse effects on the stability of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">To that end, all the authorities responsible for ensuring financial stability will play their specific role.</span>
