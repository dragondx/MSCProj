    <span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)"> Speech Guardians of stability – Central Banks, supervisors and the quest for financial stability Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Central Bank of Malta, Valletta, 12 October 2018 Ladies and gentlemen, It is an honour to be here and to join in celebrating a birthday!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.25,0)">This year, the Central Bank of Malta turns fifty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">And throughout these past fifty years, it has helped Malta to navigate the sometimes rough waters of the international monetary system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">From the early days when it focused on exchange rate policy, to its efforts in bringing the country into the euro area in 2008, and since then, as part of the Eurosystem, the Central Bank of Malta has shown resilience and adaptability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">So, I wish the central bank a very happy birthday!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.74,0)">But there is another birthday this year – a less happy one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It’s a birthday that no central banker or banking supervisor can shy away from.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.73,0)">Ten years ago, Lehman Brothers collapsed, setting off the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Since then, financial stability has become a buzzword, and for many good reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.17,0)">The instability in the financial system of 2008 had devastating consequences across the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the end, it was not only costly for banks, investors and taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.48,0)">Many people also lost their jobs, their businesses and their homes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.48,0)">Events of such a magnitude not only alter the course of people’s lives; they may alter the course of entire societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The urgency for reforms was immediately clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.27,0)">Something had gone badly wrong, and policymakers had a duty to find the causes and prevent this from ever happening again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.21,0)">To do so, they had to ask what, how and why.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">But, I did not come all the way to Malta to give you yet another “lessons learned” speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Instead, I would like to share some more thoughts on financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Financial stability may have become a buzzword, but it is not a new concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.16,0)">People have wondered in particular about the central banks’ role in financial stability for as long as central banks have existed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">For the ECB today, the issue is still complex, but the answers are clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The primary objective of the ECB is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">At the same time, it also has a contributory role in financial stability, as indicated by the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.22,0)">The ECB monitors and assesses risks to financial stability, because turbulence in the financial system may weaken the ECB’s ability to maintain price stability—the two are functionally connected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">And since the crisis, the ECB also plays a role in maintaining financial stability through its competences in banking supervision and in macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.69,0)">But going back in time, the relationship between the different functions of central banks have generated quasi-existential questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.5,0)">What a central bank is, can be defined by what it does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.84,0)">And the “what it does” part mostly revolves around the question of whether a central bank cares about two types of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The first is monetary stability: the creation of a monetary regime that can ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.39,0)">The second is financial stability which, when central banking was born, was essentially the same as “bank stability”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.68,0)">So, throughout history, the most popular definitions of “central bank” have revolved around their role in ensuring monetary stability, financial stability or both.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">One of the founding ECB board members, Tommaso Padoa Schioppa, believed that both aspects mattered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To him, a central bank was defined by its role in safeguarding both price stability and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As for financial stability, he argued that historically, a central bank’s role in this realm was rooted in its DNA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.76,0)">First, the central bank was a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.36,0)">It was also monopolist in the provision of ultimate liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.06,0)">And last but not least, it was a bankers’ bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It played a role in settling payments between banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">And a well-functioning interbank market plays an important role for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And he was of course not the only one to see the role that central banks played in financial stability as essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">From Walter Bagehot’s book “Lombard Street” all the way to the work of Charles Goodhart, one function has been singled out to identify central banks: their role as lenders of last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Take the Bank of England as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Even after becoming a monopolistic issuer of notes, it still operated as a profit-maximizing bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Charles Goodhart argues that it did not become a true central bank until the second half of the 19th century, once it let go of profit-maximizing and took on the role of lender of last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">And there is a similar story about the emergence of central banks on the other side of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.22,0)">This story roughly starts with the Panic of 1907: a series of bank runs and bank failures that devastated the US economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In the absence of a public lender of last resort, a private citizen stepped in: JP Morgan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">He called on a group of fellow bankers, and together they stopped the panic by providing loans to troubled banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This episode eventually led to the creation of the Federal Reserve System as a public lender of last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.99,0)">So, there it is: historically, some scholars saw financial stability as a central aspect of central banks’ work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.13,0)">But of course, history can be seen from different angles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And that is also true for the history of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">In fact, in explaining how modern central banks emerged, others have focused on monetary stability rather than financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Their story starts with the introduction of paper money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.29,0)">Unlike commodity money, paper money does not have an intrinsic value; after all, it’s just a piece of paper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">So when commodity money gave way to paper money, a need arose for institutions that could guarantee a stable value of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It was central banks, of course, that could do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">They could issue a national currency and ensure its stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">And here again, the Bank of England is seen as the first modern central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.81,0)">So what is it now that makes a central bank so special?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.12,0)">What is it that sets it apart from other banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Is it the ability to maintain monetary stability, the ability to maintain financial stability, or both?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.91,0)">Well, the truth is that they are sometimes hard to separate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.2,0)">It is hard to delineate when financial stability gets so important that it affects monetary policy and vice versa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.15,0)">And what’s more, things are not as simple as they used to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Today, innovations like online shopping, or global value chains, add to the complexity of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And these days financial stability is about much more than just banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.79,0)">And yet, the central question remains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.36,0)">What should central banks do?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.43,0)">What should their functions be?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.79,0)">And what their objectives?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Should they focus on both price stability and financial stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.36,0)">Or just concentrate on price stability and leave financial stability to others?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.95,0)">These are the questions I will discuss in my lecture today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In doing so, I will focus on the role of the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And to be clear from the start: the ECB has a price stability-mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Still, both branches of the ECB have a role to play in financial stability –monetary policy as well as banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.42,0)">I will break down my speech into three parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the first part, I will put on my central banker’s hat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">As a central bank, the ECB works towards price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">However, the ECB has also been dealing with issues of financial stability since it was created, working to identify and assess risks to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">And it will continue to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Since 2014, the ECB also has the power to take macroprudential policy measures enabling it to top-up national tools aimed at addressing specific stability risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">So, it can go from analysis to policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I will next look deeper into macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Can it help to maintain financial stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.37,0)">And what roles do the ECB, national central banks and other institutions play?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.07,0)">In the third part of this lecture, I will then put on my supervisor’s hat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">As a banking supervisor, the ECB helps to make banks safer, sounder and more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But as I have said elsewhere, financial stability is more than the sum of its parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.25,0)">Even if all banks were stable, the financial system could still be a bit shaky.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.37,0)">Microprudential supervision can only be part of the answer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But it is still important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">So I will conclude by focusing on how banking supervisors should contribute to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">What tools are needed, what prerequisites have to be in place?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">A central banking perspective As I already said, the ECB’s mandate is quite clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Article 127 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union leaves not a trace of doubt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">It clearly states that the “primary objective of the European System of Central Banks shall be to maintain price stability”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">But it also says that the “European System of Central Banks shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to   the stability of the financial system.” Further, the ECB needs to identify and assess risks to financial stability in order to comply with its advisory tasks on legislation, in accordance with Articles 4 and 25.1 of the Statute of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.39,0)">Hence, the ECB cannot and should not turn a blind eye to risks to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">The Treaty clearly outlines a contributory role for the ECB in maintaining financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">After all, financial stability and price stability are functionally connected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">They are linked in good times – and they are linked in bad times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.05,0)">As we saw during the last crisis, financial instability can block the channels through which monetary policy influences prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.9,0)">Thus, it can limit the ability of central banks to do their job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.51,0)">Without financial stability, it becomes quite hard to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.19,0)">Edward George, who was at the helm of the Bank of England during crises such as Black Wednesday and the collapse of Barings Bank  made this point graphically when he said: “it is inconceivable that the monetary authorities could quietly pursue their stability-oriented monetary policy objectives if the financial system through which policy is carried on   were collapsing around their ears”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">And in its own monetary policy strategy, the ECB recognizes how important financial stability is for price stability - within the mandate it has been given.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In order to best pursue its price stability mandate, the ECB adopts a two-pillar approach to assess risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The two-pillar approach, with economic analysis and monetary analysis, includes assessments of financial market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.97,0)">So, financial stability, or rather the lack of it, can affect monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.12,0)">But it is not a one-way street.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.29,0)">We should also be aware that monetary policy can affect financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.16,0)">Let us take a quick look at the potential side-effects of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.47,0)">In the aftermath of the crisis, the ECB has pursued an extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy and deployed a number of unconventional tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It began, for instance, to buy bonds on a large scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">These tools had the desired effects on the real economy, and thus on prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">They have brought benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But we must remain vigilant about their potential costs, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For one, the tools may have changed the incentives of banks, businesses and even governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.4,0)">In fact, low interest rates and abundant liquidity may encourage investors to take excessive risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Among other things, we keep a close eye on how much risk banks take.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.75,0)">Another issue is that bond purchases by the central bank can reduce liquidity in the relevant markets or distort prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.78,0)">The more bonds we buy, and the longer we go on buying, the greater the risk that prices will be distorted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">That is why we took steps to limit some of the side-effects of the ECB’s bond purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Furthermore, our actions had to be guided by careful monitoring of the markets that were likely to be most affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The ECB takes this duty to carefully monitor markets seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">And it will continue to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Does this mean that no financial stability issues will follow from the extraordinary accommodative monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Well, despite all the monitoring and the careful design of the asset purchase programme, there are still issues to consider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Interest rates have been low for a long time now, and liquidity has been abundant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Prices of several asset classes are influenced by the central bank’s policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So there are some risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.84,0)">There are risks that bubbles might be building up, and there are risks that assets might be mispriced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.09,0)">Market participants might become too lenient when assessing the real value of assets; and they might overly rely on readily available liquidity and become too lazy to prepare for different, less convenient times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.81,0)">So, this is a case where monetary policy might affect financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.79,0)">But more often than not, it is the other way round.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.32,0)">Mostly, it is the stability of the financial system which affects the tools and the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">That’s why the ECB has kept a close eye on risks to financial stability since long before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But how does that work in practice?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">How do we define financial stability in the first place?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And how do we monitor relevant risks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.21,0)">When it comes to definitions, financial stability is akin to the famous giraffe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.89,0)">It’s hard to describe, but you know it when you see it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.47,0)">Or rather: you know it when you no longer see it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Our experts think of financial stability as a condition in which the financial system, including financial intermediaries, markets and market infrastructures, is capable of withstanding shocks and the unravelling of financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Only a resilient financial system is able to support the real economy during a potential shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The definition of financial stability is quite broad, I have to admit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But I think we need to take a broad perspective when we assess risks to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The first step is to routinely look at incoming data from all relevant sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We look at both macro developments and micro developments, and we look at both the bank and non-bank sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">While we focus on the euro area, we are aware that problems can easily spread across borders and so keep an eye on global developments too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The second step is to analyse the data by applying a wide range of tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Among other things, we analyse asset prices, and we use early-warning and financial cycle models as well as models to predict outcomes such as changes in banks’ profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The third step is to collect market intelligence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.78,0)">After all, it is hard to understand the markets without talking to those who shape them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We regularly talk to analysts, managers and strategists in different financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">We try to find out what they see as potential risks, or what changes they see on the horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And of course, in all this we use expert judgment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We gather data and information and use sophisticated models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But data and models need to be interpreted and assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This is where the experience and the knowledge of our experts come into play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Once we have identified the key risks, we communicate our findings to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And we do this twice a year through our Financial Stability Review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.32,0)">Although the latest edition of the report finds the situation to be quite favourable overall, there are risks which might spoil the good mood at some point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Altogether, we identified four key risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.53,0)">The first risk is that market sentiment might suddenly change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.37,0)">This in turn could force prices in asset markets to adjust and set off a downturn in the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.16,0)">Such a repricing could be triggered by many things, both from inside the euro area and from outside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.1,0)">The second risk has to do with banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The cyclical outlook for euro area banks is improving, but there are still structural challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.32,0)">If financial or economic conditions deteriorate before the structural challenges are addressed, banks may lose their ability to finance the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.58,0)">The third risk is that public and private debt may not be sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.02,0)">Households, firms and governments are highly indebted in a number of countries, with euro area firms, in particular, carrying high levels of debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.36,0)">And also the sustainability of government debt is a concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.24,0)">The fourth risk is about liquidity in the non-bank sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">This sector has been growing for some time now, and no end is in sight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.03,0)">Not only are non-banks highly interconnected with the banking sector, they are also becoming more and more interconnected among themselves: their portfolios tend to be similar, making them more vulnerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.21,0)">So, the ECB communicates the risks it sees, and it is always a challenge to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We know that the words of a central bank can be powerful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.37,0)">They can affect markets in either direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Such communication is a challenge we cannot shy away from as it can encourage market participants to behave more prudently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">And it might also improve market discipline: by sharing our views on relevant risks, we create greater transparency about vulnerabilities in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.07,0)">What I would like to make clear, though, before closing this chapter is that, while the ECB can contribute to the stability of the financial system, it cannot by itself ensure financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.4,0)">Its mandate determines what it can and cannot do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.34,0)">For instance, the ECB cannot provide liquidity to insolvent credit institutions; and it must comply with the monetary financing prohibition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">It is therefore important that all relevant actors are fully aware of their respective responsibilities for financial stability and act in a manner to live up to those responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The macroprudential perspective What the ECB can do however is more than just identify, assess and communicate risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">As I said before, the ECB was given some relevant competences after the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">These competences cover both the macroprudential and the microprudential level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.17,0)">In other words, they cover both individual banks and the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let’s start with the system-wide approach and macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This policy area is still very young.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">It was born out of the financial crisis, but it has grown rapidly since then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Here in Europe, we now have a common framework for macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Macroprudential policy has two goals, broadly speaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">First, it aims to make the system more resilient to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">And second it aims to dampen the financial cycle, the booms and busts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.94,0)">What role does the central bank play in all this?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Well, the ECB can only address its macroprudential measures at banks and it’s not alone on the stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The ECB works together with many others – with other European and national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">At the European level, the ECB has a strong ally in the European Systemic Risk Board, or ESRB for short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The ESRB takes a broad view of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.4,0)">It keeps an eye on banks, insurers, asset managers, shadow banks, financial market infrastructures and other financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It assesses systemic risk in all these areas of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And where appropriate, it issues warnings and recommends action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Other European authorities, such as the European Banking Authority, European Securities and Markets Authority, and European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, also contribute to the ESBR’s work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">National authorities play a crucial role in macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Under the EU’s legislative concept, macroprudential policy is also a national policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The European perspective complements the national one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And this makes sense, given that financial cycles vary across countries and across sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.1,0)">At any point in time, each country or sector might be in a different stage of the cycle and thus face different risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Research shows that in a monetary union, macroprudential policy can play a very important role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.25,0)">Unlike monetary policy, it can target specific sectors or countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This in turn allows monetary policy to focus on price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In other words: macroprudential policy can “unburden” monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So how does it work in practice?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">National authorities can choose to take macroprudential measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The ECB then has the power to top-up some of these measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And while national authorities are the key players, it also makes sense to involve the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">This helps to keep an eye on any cross-border spill-overs and to alleviate any inaction bias that may still exist at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">A good example of the important role that the ECB plays in macroprudential policies is the methodology it has developed for minimum additional capital to be held by regional systemic relevant banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The methodology has reduced heterogeneity in the buffer calibration across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The current review of this methodology aims to create a level playing field, taking into account national specificities when justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">All in all, much has been achieved since the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Individual structural buffers have been applied to altogether 116 banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Six countries have activated the full capital conservation buffer and one country has activated the counter-cyclical capital buffer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">But the macroprudential framework is still young, and we can do more to improve it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We could, for instance, design a single macroprudential toolkit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">To do so, we would need to consolidate all the tools and procedures which are scattered in different places within and across different rulebooks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">We should also improve the rules on how authorities should choose and activate the tools they would like to use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">There may be ways to simplify and speed up the current multi-step process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.56,0)">And that’s not all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.98,0)">The national authority is not free to use any tool it wishes at whatever time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Rather there is a pre-defined and mandatory sequence of tools – a “pecking order”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Wouldn’t it be more sensible for the national authority to have the power to simply choose the tool that it deems most appropriate for the risk at hand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">And finally, we need to make the EU framework more comprehensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">We should add some tools, particularly borrower-based ones, such as loan-to-value ratios which come in handy in the upturn of the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Research has shown that such tools can help fight bubbles in real estate markets and limit household leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">From a more general point of view, a flexible macroprudential framework is needed; one that allows to quickly respond to market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">This will be all the more important in the future as macroprudential authorities should be ready to tackle new risks that may arise from the shift towards market-based finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.7,0)">Key to this will be looking beyond the banking sector; keeping an eye on banks is no longer enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.89,0)">Many non-banks are now operating in the financial system, and they too can pose a risk to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.81,0)">Next to the banking sector is the shadow banking sector, defined by the ESRB as the sector comprising all assets which are not held by banks, insurance companies or central counter parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">And it is big.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In terms of assets, it accounts for 40% of the EU financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.46,0)">I guess we can all agree that it would be irresponsible not to monitor such a large part of our financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The ESRB’s Shadow Banking Monitor was created to do just that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the recently published third issue of the monitor, the ESRB identified several key risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.64,0)">First, some investment funds might continue to face liquidity risks and risks associated with leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.98,0)">Second, the structure of the shadow banking sector itself can be a risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As I said, it is not just big, it is also closely interconnected with the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.49,0)">Banks provide funding to shadow banks and vice versa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">So there is considerable mutual exposure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">And these links are growing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">In 2017, wholesale funding to euro area banks from entities in the shadow banking sector reached the staggering amount of €2.2 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.08,0)">But apart from that, our picture of the shadow banking sector is not yet very clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.55,0)">In the EU, almost half of all assets in the shadow banking sector are held by institutions for which we lack a detailed statistical breakdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.64,0)">Such data gaps are a cause of concern to economists in particular, but they should raise concerns among all policymakers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">We need more data to bring this sector out of the shadows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">We need more data to examine and understand it more thoroughly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.58,0)">Otherwise, we might overlook risks that could threaten the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">A banking supervisor’s perspective But let’s now turn away from shadow banks and towards regular banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As I just said, maintaining financial stability is about two things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">First, it is about preventing the build-up of bubbles; second, it is about making the system more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Supervising individual banks helps boost resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Indeed, for a long time, microprudential supervision was the only policy field with a specific financial stability goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But this has changed a lot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">So, let’s take a closer look at how banking supervision today helps to ensure financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">ECB Banking Supervision directly supervises the 118 biggest banking groups in the euro area – with over €20 trillion euros in total assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Clearly, these banks – some in their own right, some as part of a group – are systemically relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Given their huge role in financing the euro area economy, their resilience is key to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The first step is for the supervisor to obtain a holistic view of each of these banks, not only assessing capital and liquidity risks, but also their internal controls and governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">And then the supervisor needs to act and push for improvements in all these elements if needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.9,0)">But it is not enough to look at each bank in isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">To identify and understand new risks and vulnerabilities, the second step is to take a broader view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">As supervisors we have to stay closely attuned to the macroeconomic environment in which banks operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">On the one hand, we take into account macroeconomic assessments drawn up by other European authorities and national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">On the other hand, we also take into account how each bank performs compared to its peers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">And thanks to our European perspective, we can compare banks across the entire euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">This broad view is indeed one of the great advantages of European banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Among other things, we have benefitted from it when looking at non-performing loans, interest rates risk in the banking book, leverage finance and business models in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">All this shapes our thinking and helps us to focus on the risks that count.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">European banking supervision has helped to maintain financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">It has done so by making banks safer and sounder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Euro area banks now hold more capital than ever before: their fully loaded CET1 ratio has increased by about 2.5 percentage points since 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Back then, it stood at 11.2%, now it stands at 13.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">There is no doubt that banks are more resilient today than they were in the past; they are better able to withstand financial shocks and economic downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.73,0)">But, of course, capital is not the full story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.95,0)">Liquidity is also key, as a liquidity crisis in one bank can turn into a risk to the entire system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Banks must therefore manage relevant risks very carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.34,0)">And we are not satisfied with each and every bank’s self-assessments of its liquidity risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Not all banks meet our expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">That is why we will look closer at liquidity issues through a dedicated stress test in 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">By improving each bank’s liquidity management, we make sure that the system is safer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The key ingredients of good supervision So far, I have mostly talked about how things are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Let me now focus on a few key ingredients that I believe are central to a supervisor’s contribution to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.28,0)">First, supervisors need to be independent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">They must be able to take their own decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">They must be free from pressure from banks or other stakeholders – and they must be free from political trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But independence is not the same as omnipotence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.27,0)">Independent institutions need to be accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The ECB as a banking supervisor is no exception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But independence goes beyond the institutional setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.88,0)">It also encompasses the independence of mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.92,0)">We supervisors must avoid group think and national bias.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">We should take into account as many views as possible when assessing risks and taking decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Looking ahead, I would encourage even more exchanges between the national supervisors and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.64,0)">This could mean more secondments of staff to the ECB or more cross-border on-site inspections with ECB and national authorities’ staff.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Second, for a resilient banking system the regulatory framework needs to be strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.49,0)">Supervisors can only identify risks in banks, and act to mitigate them, if the legislator gives them the competence to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Supervisors need the right tools and powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">For example, they need the power to request data and information from banks whenever they need to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In making such a request, they should, however, be mindful of the reporting burden on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">They need to strike a balance and weigh up the burden on banks against the risks that may arise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Last but not least, harmonised rules are essential tools for European supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">If we are to ensure equal treatment for all banks within the banking union, we must be able to apply the same rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And to do their jobs well, even the most competent supervisors need appropriate budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is at times forgotten, but it is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And I would like to add that money spent on good supervision is money well spent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.16,0)">The budget of European banking supervision pales in comparison to the costs of a fully-fledged banking crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Conclusion I am deeply invested in all the topics I have talked about today, so I could go on speaking about them for hours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I hope to leave you with a simple message.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.72,0)">Central banking is a complex business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The ECB’s objective of price stability is clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But delivering on our mandate requires us to deal with a constantly evolving world, and I would be remiss if I told you it’s a simple task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Our new competences for macroprudential and microprudential policy have made it even more complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">But I believe we have shown the ECB is up for the challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">It is telling that although scholars have tried to define what central banks are, and what they should do, for such a long time, we are still debating these questions today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.45,0)">And indeed, the answer is not clear-cut.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">History has shown that price stability and financial stability are deeply connected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.44,0)">You can’t have one without the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">So to deliver on our mandate of price stability, we cannot turn a blind eye to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">As regards monetary policy, we will work to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">As regards financial stability, we will continue to cooperate with European and national institutions to work towards a stable financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">And as regards banking supervision, we will work to make banks safer and sounder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I wish I could tell you it is always easy to neatly separate these worlds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.29,0)">It is not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">But I am confident that all the bright, competent, and committed Europeans working for EU and national institutions can make it happen.</span>
