    <span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)"> Payments are becoming European Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the EPC SEPA Direct Debit launch event,Brussels, 13 October 2009 SEPA Direct Debit launch We are here today to celebrate the forthcoming launch of the SEPA Direct Debit  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">We are very pleased that this important step in the process of European integration towards a single payments area will soon be taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">On 2 November 2009 the SEPA Direct Debit will be launched by the European Payments Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">From November onwards, direct debits in euro will be possible from anywhere in the European Union and even beyond  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">A direct debit payment is considered to be one of the most convenient ways of paying bills, especially for recurring expenses, because customers can be sure of paying on time, provided that there are sufficient funds in their accounts, and companies can be sure of receiving the money on time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">It is also one of the most efficient, because the collection process can be fully automated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">It is also a very safe means of payment, and it is worth emphasising that the SDD will have a higher level of security and customer protection than some of the major existing domestic direct debits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The SDD complements the SEPA Credit Transfer  , which was launched as early as January 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Although it has been possible to make cross-border credit transfers for decades, the launch of the SCT marked the start of a new era, with faster transactions and lower costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">The advent of a European direct debit is a truly new payment service at a European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">The introduction of these two basic products has laid the foundations for a fully harmonised retail payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The SEPA   project has already delivered its first results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">These will also form the basis for innovative new developments in payments, in particular a pan-European online payment solution, as well as in mobile payments and electronic invoicing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It is true that, when travelling or even living in a foreign country, one of the things that takes some getting used to is local payment habits and standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">When taking up office at the ECB in Frankfurt, I, too, had to open an extra bank account for my German payments and acquaint myself with German payment rules, standards and practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This experience is shared by many bank customers – both individual and corporate – who have accounts in more than one country or do business with companies in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">There are therefore many benefits of a harmonised retail payments market with common instruments, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.8,0)">SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">As 50% of the cross-border trade of euro area countries is with other euro area countries, small and medium-sized enterprises will benefit immensely from the harmonisation across national borders within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Also, large companies that operate in almost every European country, such as mobile phone operators, energy suppliers and petrol station chains, will gain from SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.56,0)">For those companies, managing up to 27 bank accounts, 27 standards for electronic communication with the bank or 27 different sets of requirements for card payment terminals is a truly costly business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">The Eurosystem therefore continues to strongly support the creation of SEPA, in which “individuals and companies are able to make cashless payments throughout the euro area from a single payment account anywhere in the euro area, using a single set of payment instruments as easily, efficiently and safely as they can make them today at the national level”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">SEPA is needed in order to move towards a more integrated, competitive and innovative payments market in Europe, which will bring substantial economic benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Celebrating the SDD launch today is indeed very reassuring for the whole SEPA process, and for all the efforts that are going into this project, not least for us at the ECB, who wholeheartedly support the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I am often asked the question: “Has the financial crisis made banks less likely to support the SEPA projects?” My response is usually that, as a result of the crisis, banks are once again focusing on their core business, which is attracting savings, providing loans and offering payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">In terms of offering payment services, SEPA provides a competitive, efficient and innovative retail payments market in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Less money is available for IT projects, but the business case for SEPA has not changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">I have noted that more than 2,500 banks have already signed up for the SDD service, which is a outstanding achievement, and one that few people had dared to hope for just eight months ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Back then, the EPC was deliberating whether to launch the SDD on time, because many obstacles were still seen to be in the way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">It also means that I can finally use my Austrian bank account for my German payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.44,0)">Still, despite the success of SEPA so far, there are major challenges ahead of us in the SEPA implementation process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I would like to mention three areas, in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">First, SEPA for Cards, second, the overall SEPA migration process and, third, the governance of the SEPA project in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">SEPA for Cards Card payments are growing in popularity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The recent “World Payments Report 2009”   confirms this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Despite the financial crisis, on a global basis, cashless payments increased by 8.6% to 250 billion transactions per year in 2008 and, of this growth, card payments are the strongest driver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Within the European Union, card payments reached a total of 29.5 billion transactions in 2008, likewise a growth rate of 8.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This shows the immense potential of this method of payment in generating revenue for the financial industry through growth, even at a time when interchange fees are under pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">SEPA offers tremendous opportunities for a further harmonisation of the use of cards, making them an even more attractive means of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">In essence, card payments need to be positioned as a real alternative to cash: efficient, fast and guaranteed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">We are very pleased that progress is now being made with the initiatives to create an additional European card scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Some businesses are even being set up not far from here in Brussels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">SEPA migration I will now turn to the second challenge, namely the overall SEPA migration process and the question of a possible end-date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">While the use of SCT has been increasing steadily since their launch in January 2008, they had reached 4.5% of the overall credit transfer volume in August 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.98,0)">Needless to say, this is far behind the figure for the legacy products and not really satisfactory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">However, there are some positive signs ahead: Public administrations in several countries are planning to migrate to the SEPA products later this year or in the first half of 2010, and companies with cross-border activities are expected to migrate in larger numbers after SEPA Direct Debit has also been launched in November 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Will the migration process be quick enough by itself or does it require an extra push?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.19,0)">Research has shown that a long period of maintaining dual systems is costly for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.26,0)">So what will make industry and/or customers stop using the old products and switch to SEPA?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.96,0)">You will remember that the SEPA process was only taken seriously by industry in reaction to an EC Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Although supporters of a SEPA migration end-date seem to be in the majority, opposition to the concept is not negligible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">However, we have to realise that SEPA is not just about making life easier for European citizens and companies by removing obstacles to cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">SEPA is also about removing barriers to the single market, introducing more competition to the payments industry and speeding up innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The Eurosystem will continue its efforts to foster a general understanding among stakeholders that setting a realistic but ambitious end-date for migration to SCT and SDD is a necessary step in order to reap the benefits of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Ten years after the introduction of the euro as the single currency, it is high time to complete the introduction of the euro in the field of single payment instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.99,0)">SEPA governance In connection with the migration challenge, the question arises as to the future governance of the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.23,0)">So let me talk about this now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">In the Sixth SEPA Progress Report, we suggested that improvements may be needed to the overall governance of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.31,0)">To be clear, I am not speaking about the governance of the EPC itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Improvements in SEPA governance may be needed to foster the process towards a truly integrated retail payments market in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">These improvements are related, in particular, to stakeholder involvement, transparency and the SEPA migration progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Is market self-regulation sufficient to find solutions for these issues?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">The Eurosystem – together with the European Commission – recognises that a new, overarching body, consisting of a broad range of stakeholders, could tackle and resolve issues that are slowing the realisation of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.46,0)">But I want to repeat that this body would not replace the current arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The EPC would remain responsible for the design of payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The new body, by contrast, would focus entirely on identifying key issues of concern to public authorities and other stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Moreover, it would define priorities and promote action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">In addition, it would work on fostering a common understanding among users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.76,0)">As I have said, it should not by any means replace or hamper the functioning of the EPC, nor should it take over the dialogue with end-users on its precise schemes, frameworks and standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Within the Eurosystem, we are currently working on the modalities for this “SEPA Council” while working together closely with the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Conclusion I will conclude by saying that it remains the goal of the Eurosystem to promote the advent of an integrated, efficient and innovative retail payments market in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The SEPA project should be as much a part of a bank’s core business as the provision of efficient payment services to its customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Now that we have a single market for goods and services, we need a single market for payments to actually pay for these goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">SEPA is also necessary to complete the introduction of the euro as the single currency of 329 million European citizens and to foster financial integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The launch of the SDD marks a further step forward in the process of European integration towards a single payments area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">I congratulate all those who contributed to this milestone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Thank you!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.9,0)">SEPA comprises the countries of the EU plus Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and
