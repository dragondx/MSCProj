    <span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)"> Keynote address at the Süddeutsche Zeitung Führungstreffen Wirtschaft 2013 Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,at Führungstreffen Wirtschaft “Strategies for more growth” organised by Süddeutsche Zeitung,Berlin, 21 November 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.16,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, The euro area has been through a difficult period of correcting the imbalances of the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.15,0)">The necessary adjustment has inevitably put our economies under strain, and it has also caused unemployment that is still unacceptably high, especially among the young.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Yet I see signs today that the euro area is slowly advancing on the road to recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.92,0)">The latest data suggest that, little by little, economic growth is again taking hold – although it remains weak, uneven and fragile, while the risks surrounding the economic outlook continue to be on the downside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This gives policy-makers in the euro area an opportunity to alter their focus – to be less absorbed in short-term crisis management, and more focused on building an economy with more stability, more growth and more jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Today I would like to discuss what we can do individually and collectively to achieve that goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">My key point is that the return of economic growth is not a signal that reform efforts are behind us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">On the contrary, to secure the recovery and create jobs, determined action is more important than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">All actors in the euro area have a part to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">A sustainable recovery first and foremost requires price stability, which we at the European Central Bank   will continue to provide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">It requires more competitive economies, for which governments must create the right conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">And it requires dynamic and inclusive business models, which social partners and business leaders can deliver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">We all benefit from a prosperous and dynamic euro area economy, so we all have a responsibility to make it a success – national governments, social partners, businesses and European actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Monetary policy Let me first describe what the ECB is doing to maintain price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I will start with a quick review of the key principles underlying our monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As you know, the Treaty establishes price stability as the ECB’s primary mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This mandate has guided our monetary policy since monetary union began.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">And it will continue guiding our monetary policy in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">To put our mandate into practice, the ECB’s Governing Council has established a transparent, ambitious and verifiable objective – namely, to keep average inflation in the euro area below but close to 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The rationale behind this objective was explained at the time we clarified our strategy in 2003, notably in remarks by our then chief economist Otmar Issing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">It ensures that inflation remains low enough to avoid distorting the decisions of firms and households in the economy – while preserving a sufficient buffer away from zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">We need this buffer away from zero to provide a safety margin against deflationary risks at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.64,0)">It also prevents countries experiencing inflation rates well below the euro area average as part of their adjustment processes from being forced to operate in deflationary territory for protracted period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.59,0)">These considerations are the backdrop against which we decided to cut our main policy rates two weeks ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.78,0)">The rationale for action The context of this decision was a gradual but sustained downward drift in inflation that we had observed over several months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.83,0)">Inflation projections by ECB staff, as well as by other major forecasting institutions, had been revised down repeatedly over the last year – from already low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.25,0)">And the process of gradual disinflation did not just affect individual, volatile components of inflation such as energy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Instead, it reflected a broad-based reduction in all major inflation components since last summer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The disinflationary trend was further confirmed by the latest yearly inflation figures published by Eurostat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.15,0)">These were revised down by almost half a percentage point to 0.7% in October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.98,0)">Overall, we have been witnessing a disinflation “in slow motion” for several months now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.63,0)">And combined with still weak economic and monetary dynamics, the latest data suggest that we may experience a prolonged period of low inflation going forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.63,0)">So why did we act?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.5,0)">It was not because we see deflation risks materialising in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">With the recovery taking hold, we still expect inflation to return very gradually to levels below but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">This view is also supported by inflation expectations, which over a longer-term horizon remain firmly anchored at levels close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Rather, we acted to restore an appropriate safety margin from zero as prescribed by our price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">By rebuilding the safety margin, our accommodative stance also has an important side effect: it facilitates the continuing process of internal rebalancing in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Countries with past competitiveness deficits should accept low inflation rates relative to the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.38,0)">And monetary policy cannot and should not discourage the ambitious reform efforts that are necessary to achieve such rebalancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.84,0)">But if average inflation is allowed to drift too low at the euro area level, it is much harder for those countries to undershoot the average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.88,0)">And in the process, adjustment runs into major headwinds as demand suffers and real debt burdens rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Addressing the concerns I am of course aware that our rate cut has raised some concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.47,0)">One concern is the effect of this decision on different countries in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, it is important to understand that setting monetary policy for a union of 17 member states is not the same as for a single country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What is the same is the objective – price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But what is different is the institutional setting, the decision-making procedures and the instruments for the implementation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And crucially, in monetary union price stability is defined for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This is the mandate that was given to us by the euro area member states and, since the launch of the euro, we have delivered it continuously and in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Euro area price stability is confirmed and anchored into the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.46,0)">Another concern is the implication of low interest rates for savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This concern is understandable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.44,0)">But the effect of monetary policy on the returns on savings cannot be seen in isolation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">First, we need to take account of the state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.17,0)">Interest rates are low because the economy is weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Accommodative monetary policy is a response to this, designed to restore sustainable growth in an environment of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.23,0)">If we were to raise rates in this situation, it would only depress the economy further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And this would in turn affect savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.63,0)">Why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.51,0)">Because people would lose their jobs or have their wages cut in a prolonged and entrenched recession, thus reducing the amount they can save.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.1,0)">Or because they would see returns on assets fall, thus reducing their investment income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.72,0)">When the economy contracts, incomes fall, and savings necessarily fall in tandem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.12,0)">Moreover, the interest rate that matters most to long-term savers is not the main ECB refinancing rate, but the rate on safe long-term investments – in Germany, that is long-term Bunds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The ECB’s decisions influence these long-term rates but there are also other factors at play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.02,0)">For example, on the day of our rate cut of 25 basis points, interest rates on 10-year Bunds fell by less than 7 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Since then those rates have risen by about 2 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.1,0)">The current low level of interest rates on long-term Bunds is largely explained by investors that have sought safe assets in the context of sovereign debt tensions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.46,0)">A third concern about low interest rates is that they undermine incentives for reform in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.59,0)">It is true that monetary policy decisions can have side effects – I mentioned a positive side effect earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Yet we act for the euro area as a whole in line with our mandate, not for individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">If there is concern about reform incentives, we need to ask whether the framework of economic governance is being sufficiently enforced, and if not, what could be done to strengthen it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">After all, ensuring sound fiscal and economic policies is ultimately the task of political authorities, not monetary authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Economic policy In the same vein, we know that monetary policy alone cannot create a sustainable recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Restarting growth ultimately depends on governments, business leaders and social partners working together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Governments need to create the conditions that allow entrepreneurs to generate growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">There is no short cut to growth through debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Growth ultimately has to come from increasing the productive capacity of the economy – that is, through raising competitiveness and productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">This country presents a good example of how to build solid foundations for growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Germany has competitive and innovative firms that are embedded in global value chains, notably the Mittelstand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The country has enacted labour market reforms that have helped maintain price competitiveness, and that limit the impact of economic downturns on the young.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">And it has done this while working in cooperation with social partners, who understand that business models have to adapt to a globalised economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In short, Germany has oriented itself in a direction that in my view would benefit all euro area countries: being forward-looking, open to the world and focused on competitiveness and productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.4,0)">Abraham Lincoln famously said that “you cannot make the weak stronger by making the strong weaker”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Similarly, the answer to the problems of the euro area is not to weaken its stronger economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Rather, it is to strengthen its weaker economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And in fact, this is what we are seeing in the euro area today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.54,0)">Most countries that lost competitiveness are regaining it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">They are converging towards the most competitive countries, not vice versa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">They have learned the fundamental lesson – for which Germany is the model – that in a monetary union, wages have to reflect productivity to maintain price competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.06,0)">For example, the countries under full EU-IMF programmes have seen their unit labour costs fall by more than 15 percentage points since 2009, relative to the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.29,0)">Current accounts are in balance or surplus in all the countries under strain, meaning that they are no longer accumulating external debt and “living beyond their means” – and larger countries would be well advised to follow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">And even though declines in import demand play an important role, the rebalancing in countries under strain is also coming from growth in exports and increasing market shares.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">In Spain, for example, export volumes are up by more than 20% since 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.52,0)">For this reason, I do not agree with those who say that Europe is in a “lost decade”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Euro area countries are using the second decade of the euro to undo the mistakes of the first – and in doing so, laying the foundations for sustainable growth in the decades to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.25,0)">The challenge ahead The task of restoring sustainable growth is still far from complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Regaining competitiveness is only one part of the challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Another essential component is to reverse the damage to the economy caused by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.26,0)">It has reduced the euro area’s output level and perhaps also its growth rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">To turn that around requires higher investment in human and physical capital – and in all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.31,0)">In Germany, for example, investment is still around 1 percentage point of GDP lower than it was in 2007, and in that year it already had the lowest investment ratio in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Both the public and private sectors have a role to play here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Generating higher investment is ultimately the job of the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">But public authorities have to create the conditions that facilitate and encourage this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">I see three conditions as crucial: a stable macroeconomic environment; growth-enhancing structural reforms; and a healthy banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">First, a stable macroeconomic environment provides the certainty that is so important for investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">That entails medium-term price stability, which the ECB is providing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">And it entails medium-term economic stability, which governments have to ensure through sustainable fiscal and economic policies and adhering to the euro area rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Second, structural reforms are vital to raise growth potential and make new investment attractive – especially in the current environment where firms may have become less optimistic as a result of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Of particular importance are reforms that increase competition, which in turn drives innovation, efficiency and productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Such reforms include opening up protected sectors and removing barriers for new firms to enter the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Third, we need a healthy banking sector to ensure that capital can be allocated where productive investment is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.53,0)">Bank lending in the euro area is currently very weak, having fallen for 16 straight months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.02,0)">This in part reflects the state of the economy; in part it reflects balance sheet constraints in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">But as the economy picks up next year, we need to ensure that those balance sheet constraints do not hinder the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This is why the rigorous and comprehensive assessment of banks’ balance sheets currently being undertaken by the ECB is so important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Prompt corrective actions by banks themselves are welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Taken together, these three conditions will provide firms with the certainty, optimism and financing they need to restart investing – and hence to get the euro area back to a higher growth trajectory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">I have today described the actions being taken by all actors in the euro area to ensure stability and raise growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">A great deal of progress has been made, but a great deal still remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For the sake of those who remain unemployed, we have to persevere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.73,0)">Now is not the time to relax reform efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.9,0)">Nor is it the time to become fractious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">We all benefit from an environment of inflation at below but close to 2% in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">We all benefit from measures to raise productivity and improve competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">It is never the case that sound economic policies are good for some in the euro area but not for others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">I trust that this audience understands our shared responsibility for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">After all, we are the euro area – its citizens, its firms and its institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">It is only by acting together that we can put the crisis behind us, and move forward towards a brighter, more prosperous future.</span>
