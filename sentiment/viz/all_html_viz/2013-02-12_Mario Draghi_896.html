    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)"> Introductory Statement at the Congreso de los Diputados de España Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,Meeting with Members of Parliament,Madrid, 12 February 2013 Dear President Posada, Honourable Members of Parliament, I would like to thank you most warmly for your kind invitation to appear before this chamber of Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">As President of the European Central Bank  , it is an honour to have this opportunity to discuss the big challenges facing the euro area economy and to explain the major policy actions that we are taking in response to those challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">After outlining what we have done, I will be very keen to hear your views – on Europe’s economy, on ECB policies and on the future design of our economic and monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">By the end of this session, I hope that we will have reached a good mutual understanding – one that will allow us, within our respective institutional mandates, to make further progress on the twin challenges of strengthening our union and returning to sound and stable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Over the past few years, we have seen how deeply the economies of the euro area countries are interconnected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.82,0)">It is an emphatic reminder of how economic policies in one country have significant effects on other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As the democratically elected representatives of the Spanish people, you are responsible for domestic economic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Yet in the exercise of those duties, just like all national parliaments in the euro area, you influence the functioning of our economic and monetary union as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.92,0)">As the President of the European Council Herman van Rompuy has said, national parliaments have become European institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">It is important that we all recognise these mutual interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In my introductory remarks today, I would like to focus on three topics: the state of the economy, the ECB’s monetary policy and the longer-term vision for our economic and monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I will then be happy to hear your views and take your questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Adjustment in the euro area economy Let me begin with the overall situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">As you know, the euro area economy is undergoing an important adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.36,0)">This process is necessary, but it is particularly painful and protracted in those areas where past misalignments of policies created vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.62,0)">Particular difficulties stem from the large imbalances of highly indebted sectors and unsound public finances in some euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">But we are seeing the first positive results of the adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">For example, euro area countries have almost halved their fiscal deficits from 6.2% of GDP in 2010 to an estimated 3.3% in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.81,0)">Excluding interest payments, the primary deficit of the euro area as a whole is virtually zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.56,0)">This contrasts with the United States and Japan, which recorded primary deficits of around 6% of GDP in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.41,0)">Several euro area countries are addressing their external imbalances, among them Spain, whose current account deficit fell substantially – from almost 10% in 2008 to about 1% in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">According to the latest data, your country’s exports have increased notably – by about 20% in volume between 2009 and last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">There has been a similar increase in Portugal and, to a somewhat lesser extent, in Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Over the same period, the share of exports in GDP increased by around 10 percentage points in Spain, Ireland and Portugal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Exports are providing a strong positive contribution to real economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">These economies are also seeing a fall in unit labour costs, which will improve their competitiveness and provide a platform for sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Notwithstanding these signs of improvement, the adjustment has not yet had a visible impact on people’s daily lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.44,0)">Frustration in some parts of the population is thus understandable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Reform efforts take time to reveal their full beneficial effects – and they must reach a critical mass before they lead to a fundamental turnaround in economic prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The top priorities on the reform agenda remain correcting misalignments and restoring the capacity of the economy to create value, incomes and jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Governments must persevere on the path towards sound and stable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">National parliaments are key contributors to this process, notably in effective communication to the public of the ultimate goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.37,0)">In saying all this, I am acutely aware of the significant social costs that the adjustment entails, especially for those who have lost their jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I am very conscious of this human dimension of the recession, particularly the difficulties facing many of your constituents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">But the reforms should not be seen in isolation: they aim to create stronger, better functioning and, yes, also fairer economies, for the benefit of all citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.59,0)">Countries undertaking painful but necessary reforms should not feel that they have been left to fend for themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Creating a more stable and prosperous future for Europe is the goal that unites all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">To make progress, we need a shared sense of direction, a sense of cohesion across countries and a sense of solidarity within societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The shared sense of direction is expressed in laying the foundations for sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">In some countries, this implies re-orienting the main engines of growth towards productive sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">It also implies regaining competitiveness by containing or reducing costs via a combination of accelerated productivity and wage restraint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The sense of cohesion is expressed in the single market, the single currency and common European institutions to ensure good governance and, when needed, mutual assistance and support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The sense of solidarity within societies should be expressed by ensuring that the burden is not borne disproportionately by certain sectors or groups of people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy Let me now turn to the specific policy actions that the ECB has taken in response to the challenges to the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There are two key elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.91,0)">The first has been to reduce our key interest rate to 0.75%, a level previously unseen in virtually all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.25,0)">The interest rate in the overnight interbank market is now even lower, close to zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">The second element has been to give banks unrestricted access to central bank funding through both our short- and long-term operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.01,0)">This policy meant that banks did not have to shrink their balance sheets unnecessarily at a time when market funding became unavailable or excessively costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">It prevented a potential deflationary scenario, thus ensuring delivery on the ECB’s primary objective of maintaining price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">At the same time, the policy has alleviated funding constraints for banks that decide to renew or extend their loans to firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This removes one obstacle to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Since three quarters of firms’ external finance in the euro area comes from banks, we need them to be delivering a sound supply of credit to support investment and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">We have provided banks with assurance that, with adequate collateral, they can draw unlimited volumes of central bank liquidity at our key interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">We effectively stood in for the interbank market: when that market stopped functioning, our actions allowed banks to continue lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The overall size of our refinancing operations increased from less than €450 billion before the crisis to more than €1.2 trillion at its peak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">We have also provided banks with assurance that they can rely on our refinancing operations for extended periods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">The maximum maturity of these operations increased from three months to three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.91,0)">Without the two three-year refinancing operations launched in late 2011 and early 2012, there could have been a major credit crunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Through these measures, the ECB has decisively addressed the liquidity pressures faced by euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Here in Spain, for example, the liquidity support extended to the banking system currently corresponds to a quarter of the country’s GDP, about eight times what it was before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">To ensure delivery on the ECB’s primary objective of safeguarding price stability, it was essential to create an environment in which liquidity is not an obstacle to credit creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">But liquidity is not the only factor determining banks’ capacity and willingness to lend to firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.44,0)">There are two additional factors: banks’ availability of capital; and the general perception of risk in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.29,0)">Provision of capital is not among the tasks of a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is the task of shareholders to ensure that banks are solvent and able to sustain their core business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.18,0)">When the private sector is unable or unwilling to provide capital, it is for the fiscal authorities – governments and parliaments – to decide whether and how to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Here in Spain, the authorities have been proactive, even in strained conditions, embarking on an ambitious financial adjustment programme with the assistance of their European partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.87,0)">The programme – which is proceeding on schedule – has removed from the balance sheets of the weakest banking institutions the troubled assets that had been a drag on their business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The programme has recapitalised these institutions with fresh funds and laid the foundations for their return to health and active lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.44,0)">The general perception of risk is the third determinant of credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.33,0)">Just like any other central bank, the ECB cannot control microeconomic risk – how banks assess whether a potential borrower will fail to repay a loan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Microeconomic risk is related to the conditions prevailing in the specific sector in which a firm operates or to the firm’s cost structure and capacity to innovate and create value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It is the role of structural, sectoral and fiscal policies to facilitate the reallocation of resources to activities that have real economic value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">For its part, the ECB is actively contributing to a reduction in macroeconomic risk: by firmly stabilising inflation expectations, it provides a nominal anchor for the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This is important for all lending and borrowing decisions, particularly the financing of longer-term investment projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Our decision last summer to prepare for Outright Monetary Transactions   in government bond markets can be seen in this light.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">OMTs are designed to focus on bonds with a remaining maturity of up to three years, aiming to keep medium-term inflation expectations stable by avoiding a highly damaging breakdown in the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.61,0)">The ECB can only consider OMTs if there are major problems in the transmission of monetary policy and if there is strict and effective conditionality attached to an appropriate European Stability Mechanism   programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There are two reasons for this conditionality framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">First, OMTs are a backstop against destructive speculation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.01,0)">They are not a subsidy for government financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.52,0)">OMTs should remove only the part of the interest rate at which governments borrow that is due to unfounded expectations of destructive scenarios for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">But our interventions are conceivable only if the risk of fiscal dominance is firmly excluded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">This requires certainty that governments will maintain fiscal discipline and that continuous reforms will correct underlying weaknesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Only strict and effective conditionality can generate that kind of assurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The second reason for conditionality is that an ESM programme is a catalyst for reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">It can change the economic prospects of a country towards a higher growth potential, complementing monetary policy in its efforts to support the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In the past few months, we have seen a gradual easing of financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.92,0)">Credit spreads on sovereign and corporate bonds have fallen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Equity prices have recovered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Banks have regained market access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">And money has flowed back into European debt markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">ECB policies have played a pivotal role in this improvement, as has resolute action by governments, parliaments and the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">All should persevere in these efforts with confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The ECB, for its part, will continue to safeguard price stability, as it has done over the past 13 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The longer-term vision Let me turn briefly to the longer-term vision for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">As you know, it is widely understood that our monetary union needs to be complemented by a financial union, a fiscal union, a genuine economic union and eventually a deeper political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The most urgent project – financial union – is taking tangible shape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The ECB is expected to become the single supervisor for a large part of the euro area’s banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">We stand ready to launch our internal preparations as soon as the European Parliament and the European Council reach an agreement on the legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The proposal for a single resolution framework is also in the pipeline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Taken together, these two reforms will re-establish confidence in the euro area’s banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">It is also essential that we complete economic union by creating the conditions for each country to find its place in the open market economy that is the euro area, and to exploit its comparative advantages to generate jobs and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is the meaning of a well-functioning economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">And it will only happen if we restore competitiveness across the euro area, if we improve the functioning of product and labour markets, and if we invest in skills and innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">The idea of ‘mutually agreed contracts for competitiveness and growth’ or ‘reform contracts’ could be very helpful here by targeting policy actions in areas that are key to restoring competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">We would also benefit from a thorough review of product and labour markets to ensure that they are compatible with the functioning of monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">We have begun this year with a more stable financial environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">This has been achieved through concerted reform efforts by governments and parliaments and decisive actions by European institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As I said at the beginning of my remarks, all national parliaments in the euro area influence the functioning of our economic and monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Spain plays a prominent role in this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Throughout the current phase of economic adjustment, communication between European and national policy-makers and consensus-building efforts within domestic constituencies are of critical importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">This is the best way to safeguard our future collective prosperity.</span>
