    <h3> Speaker: Vítor Constâncio </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)"> Beyond traditional banking: a new credit system coming out of the shadows Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 2nd Frankfurt Conference on Financial Market Policy: Banking Beyond Banks, organised by the SAFE Policy Center of Goethe University,Frankfurt am Main, 17 October 2014 Ladies and gentlemen, Let me begin by thanking the conference organisers and program directors of the SAFE   Policy Center, Hans-Helmut Kotz and Jan Pieter Krahnen, for the kind invitation to speak at this 2nd Frankfurt Conference on Financial Market Policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The topic of this 2nd Frankfurt Conference is very well chosen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Clearly the organisers at the SAFE Policy Center recognise that the provision of credit to the euro area real economy as well as some of the risks that this may entail, also occurs beyond the regulatory perimeter of banks, a topic which was discussed in depth at the 1st Frankfurt Conference on Financial Market Policy organised last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I noted that you decided to name this conference “Banking Beyond Banks” rather than “Shadow Banking” which is a term that is often used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.2,0)">For some reason, the term “shadow banking” has acquired a pejorative connotation in some quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.33,0)">There is no justification for that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The expression “Banking Beyond Banks”, or “Non-bank Banking”, which I learnt is Hans-Helmut’s preference, on the other hand, is less of a loaded term because it implicitly also acknowledges non-banks’ contribution to the financing of the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">My remarks will first focus on the non-bank banking that takes place in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I will then elaborate on some potential risks to financial stability, and end with some thoughts about regulatory challenges and macro-prudential policies aimed at managing such risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">How much non-bank banking actually takes place in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.96,0)">The FSB     defines shadow banking as “credit intermediation involving entities and activities   outside the regular banking system.” The different work streams created by the FSB to analyse the issue include indeed both entities and activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.43,0)">However, in its regular Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report, the FSB focuses much more on entities that, being non-banks are involved in credit intermediation, than on activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.33,0)">The reason for that is very much connected with the lack of data to do otherwise, as I will explain later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">From the perspective of institutions, the broadest measure of the euro area shadow banking sector, akin to the broad measure proposed by the Financial Stability Board  , refers to the assets of Money Market Funds   and “Other Financial Intermediaries”   that include all non-monetary financial institutions apart from insurance corporations and pension funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">According to our own estimates, which we supply to the FSB, this measure has more than doubled in size over the past decade and reached approximately EUR 19 trillion in the euro area   The growing importance of the sector within the financial system has gathered pace over the past two years as euro area banks have been deleveraging, while shadow banking entities, in particular investment funds, have expanded further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.74,0)">For instance, while the banking sector’s total assets have decreased by 11% since 2012, the total assets of investment funds have increased by 30%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.54,0)">Caveats must however be made about this aggregate figure since a significant residual of about 40% of the data refers to a broad and unspecified sector  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.42,0)">On the basis of national financial accounts and securities statistics compiled by the ECB, it is our understanding that most of this residual relates to entities located in the Netherlands and Luxembourg and is composed of single entities, holding companies or special financial institutions, that are set up mainly by non-financial corporations and that are very likely not engaged in non-bank banking because they are not involved in credit intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">We hope to obtain better information in the future to exclude these entities from that residual category.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.66,0)">Similar problems occur in other jurisdictions and affect the estimated total size of the shadow banks of USD 75 trillion quoted by the FSB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The ECB has in recent years collected balance sheet data on investment funds and financial vehicle corporations located in the euro area, and this collection has shed some light on the composition of the shadow banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Important changes have taken place within the system that can be linked back to three by-products of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.51,0)">First, the very low interest rate environment has created challenges for money market funds   and their assets shrank from a pre-crisis peak of EUR 1.3 trillion to EUR 835 billion in mid-2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.23,0)">Second, reflecting the collapse in securitisation activity, the assets of financial vehicle corporations involved in securitisations located in the euro area shrank by almost a third to EUR 1.9 trillion over that period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Third, the decline in money market funds and financial vehicle corporations has been more than offset by the strong growth of the euro area   investment fund sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Against a backdrop of a shift towards market-based financing and, more recently, an intense global search for yield, the   euro area investment funds sector has rose to EUR 8.7 trillion in mid-2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Any monitoring of non-bank banking based on such an “entities-based approach” should however be complemented by an “activities-based approach” that focuses on intermediation activities conducted primarily through markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">What is included in this perspective are a vast array of services related to securitisation transactions, securities financing transactions  , securities lending and repos, collateral management and intermediation, the development of derivatives allowing for risk transformation and exchange via swaps, from credit default swaps to interest rate or forex swaps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Several of these activities can be conducted by regulated banks or by non-specifically regulated institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Basically, two aspectsmake the collection of these activities relevant: first, they contributed to the creation of a type of capital market lending system with secured short-term market funding; second, these services originate forms of liquidity instruments that are forms of money not counted in the usual monetary aggregates that we calculate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">These two features – the emergence of a new market credit system and the significance of forms of money not viewed as such – is what justifies the “shadow banking” designation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.8,0)">That is why some authors   reserve designation of shadow banking to a definition confined to this type of activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.14,0)">The origins of this new credit system are related to the emergence of very sizeable cash pools that could not find safety in banks’ insured deposits and were looking for safer ways of placing that cash in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Secured collateral lending and repos as well as risk transformation via swap derivatives   were developed for that purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Securities lending for shorting and generating collateralised levered transactions for asset managers were also part of the new system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The activities of re-hypothecation and re-use of securities amplified the creation of chains of inside liquidity and higher leverage with negative consequences when the crisis led to an increase in haircuts and illiquidity in the repo market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Fortunately, the FSB has recently established a working group tasked with examining the possible harmonisation of regulatory approaches to re-hypothecation of client assets and the possible financial stability issues related to collateral re-use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">In light of the underlying financial stability risks and its huge importance in financial markets, I very much welcome this work, which takes a broad and macro-prudential view on these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.93,0)">The activity of the shadow banking sector escapes both the monetary statistics and the flow-of-funds accounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Zolten Pozsar proposes the development of a new set of accounts to register the Flow of Collateral and the Flow of Risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.26,0)">There are no good databases of securities lending or repos and they can only be developed with the collaboration of the industry as most of the operations in question are over-the-counter operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Some time ago I launched an initiative to create such a database compiled by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.73,0)">Contacts with the industry and the Bank of England proved to be encouraging but other priorities imposed justifiable delays in the implementation of such an idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.71,0)">What these data gaps imply is that we do not know enough about the shadow banking sector and that tackling this shortcoming must be given the highest priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Stijn Claessens and Lev Ratnovski     have suggested a criterion to pin down the activities that appropriately belong to the concept of shadow banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.15,0)">The nature of those activities imply large size, reduced margins and tail risks, which means that they require some sort of private or public backstop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This relates, for instance, to the provision of liquidity lines for securitisation vehicles, the use of the banks’ balance sheets   to operate in the repo market  , or still, in the same market, the so-called bankruptcy-remote privileges for lenders secured on financial collateral  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Without these forms of implicit public support, the repo market would not have expanded the way it did.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.16,0)">This requirement for backstops also indicates that the border between shadow banking activities and the regulated sector is more blurred than one might have thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.47,0)">One important regulatory problem of this type of shadow banking is that it has increased so much in size and is now totally internationalised and embedded in the financial globalisation that it cannot enjoy the sort of public backstops that the traditional sector used to enjoy until recently, and from which it still partly benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">As Zoltan Pozsar writes: “The global macro drivers behind the secular rise of cash pools and leveraged portfolio managers in the asset management complex are identical with the real economy drivers behind the idea of secular stagnation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.79,0)">As such, one way to interpret shadow banking is as the financial economy reflection of real economy imbalances caused by excess global savings, slowing potential growth, and the rising share of corporate profits relative to wages in national income”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.09,0)">What I briefly described points to the fact that the regulation of these new realities is necessarily very difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Regarding regulatory efforts underway, the FSB has focused on five specific areas: to mitigate the spill-over effect between the regular banking system and the shadow banking system; to reduce the susceptibility of money market funds   to “runs”; to assess and align the incentives associated with securitisation; to dampen risks and pro-cyclical incentives associated with securities financing transactions such as repos and securities lending that may exacerbate funding strains in times of market stress; and to assess and mitigate systemic risks posed by other shadow banking entities and activities.”   A few days ago, the FSB published the regulatory framework for haircuts on non-centrally cleared securities financing and repos.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The idea of imposing minimum haircuts in these transactions is to contain the excessive leverage created by them and also to possibly limit the subsequent volatility of such haircuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.7,0)">Nevertheless, the scope of the regulation applies numerical haircut floors only to non-centrally-cleared securities financing transactions in which financing against collateral other than government securities is provided to non-banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.55,0)">In addition, the framework recommends “qualitative standards for methodologies used by market participants that provide securities financing to calculate haircuts on the collateral received transactions.” The numerical haircuts vary between 0.5 % and 10% according to the type and maturity of the securities used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The immediate impact may not be very relevant but the potential role of the new instruments can become relevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Non-bank banking risks to financial stability Let me now turn to the perspective of non-bank entities that perform credit intermediation and/or maturity transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The FSB, in the Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report   of last year wrote that “ Intermediating credit through non-bank channels can have important advantages and contributes to the financing of the real economy, but such channels can also become a source of systemic risk, especially when they are structured to perform bank-like functions   and when their interconnectedness with the regular banking system is strong ” In my opinion, these conditions do apply as   shadow banking entities are indeed structured to perform bank-like functions, in part even standing in for the declining role of a deleveraging regular banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Furthermore, the interconnectedness of shadow banking entities with the regular banking system is strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.87,0)">The significant expansion of the shadow banking sector can present systemic risks that need to be detected, monitored and managed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.68,0)">Similar to the traditional financial intermediation activities of banks, shadow bank credit intermediation involves having credit exposures, normally through purchased securities, that are of a longer maturity and are less liquid than the short term and liquid nature of their liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Moreover, some of these entities are leveraged, although leverage differs greatly among various entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.39,0)">For instance, the majority of the investment funds that are an important part of this sector are of the open-ended type and do not face a problem of leverage but can become vulnerable because of the degree of maturity transformation they originate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In addition, many of the open-ended funds offered by asset management firms, such as exchange-traded funds  , in essence provide a promise of   daily liquidity that they may not be able to deliver under stressed conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.29,0)">The combination of potentially stretched valuations in some financial market segments and low liquidity in secondary markets could represent a systemic threat when combined with a high redemption risks for funds with significant duration mismatches, low cash buffers and with direct contagion channels such as credit lines to the regular banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.16,0)">Another reason for concern stems from the fact that the shadow banking sector is highly interconnected with euro area credit institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Some segments of the shadow banking system play a role in the funding of the monetary financial institution   sector, while some are themselves reliant on MFIs for their funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Therefore, difficulties in the sector can propagate quickly to the banking sector and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.99,0)">Another perspective about the riskiness of non-bank banking relates not to categories of entities and their bank-like structures and activities, but to the very large footprint that some individual institutions have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.16,0)">Many institutions have hundreds of billions or even trillions of assets under management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.36,0)">We have recently observed that even ordinary events, such as personnel changes, can influence financial markets, when they concern key decision makers at very large asset management firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.31,0)">Additional regulatory concerns I already highlighted the difficulties in understanding and regulating the elusive reality of shadow banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">To enhance this understanding, a first requisite is to require the reporting of all the necessary information for regulators so that indicators of leverage and liquidity risk for the financial system as a whole can be compiled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.26,0)">Several entities that are included in this concept of shadow banking, like money market funds and investment funds in general, are already subject to some form of regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.98,0)">This includes rules about the composition of assets, liquidity buffers and gates or redemption fees to contain possible runs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Regarding regulation on money market funds, I think that the Commission’s proposal is adequate whereas I doubt that the solution of generalised variable net asset value   prevailing in the US is sufficient to contain instability episodes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Hedge funds were not at the centre of the crisis and are a business that applies high fees and benefits from investors knowledgeable about the risks they incur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">What is essential is the vigilance concerning the borders of regulated versus non-regulated entities and activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.86,0)">We are aware that tighter regulations for banks have been one of the drivers of non-bank based activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This so-called “boundary problem  ” is not new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.35,0)">It arises because effective regulation penalises those within the regulated perimeter and causes a substitution of activities to entities outside the regulatory perimeter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.18,0)">Addressing this problem implies regulating the exposures that the regulated sector creates towards the non-banks and in the extreme a possible change of the regulatory perimeter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">This change need not be for the entire non-bank sector, but placing systemically important non-banks within the perimeter should be possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the United States, non-bank systemically important financial institutions     are placed under enhanced prudential supervision by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">This step has already been implemented for some institutions  , while non-bank SIFI designation is being studied for some large asset managers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The FSB, jointly with the International Organization of Securities Commissions  , is currently developing methodologies for identifying non-bank non-insurer global systemically important financial institutions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I very much welcome this Too-Big-To-Fail strand of work by the FSB and IOSCO.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">It will help us assess this broad and heterogeneous segment of the financial system in a way that is consistent and comparable with what the Basel Committee has already done for the so-called G-SIBs   and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors   plans to do for G-SIIs  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Once the methodology for identification of NBNI G-SIFI is agreed  , the discussion should move quickly to and focus on the appropriate incremental policy measures that these identified institutions should be subject to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Here, it is key to design measures that ensure that these entities internalise the potential costs they impose on the financial system, and at the same time provide for incentives to reduce their systemic footprint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.3,0)">Another aspect related with the boundary problem relates to the convenience of regulating the exposures of banks to non-banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.84,0)">The Basel Committee has already defined the capital charges related to equity participations of banks in non-bank institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Regarding simple credit exposures, the large exposures   regime could play a role in protecting banks from potentially excessive exposures to the shadow banking sector and in moving contagion risk from shadow banks back into the core banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Currently, shadow banking exposures are not singled out for specific treatment within the Basel Committee’s LE Rules that were agreed on earlier this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.43,0)">However, exposures of individual banks to shadow banks are subject to the general LE limit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This means that a single exposure to a shadow banking entity cannot be greater than 25% of a bank’s Tier 1 capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Also here, we may need to go beyond and acquire additional macro-prudential tools that focus on the overall exposure to sectors, and in this context to the shadow banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the EU, the European Banking Authority is currently developing guidelines for the setting of specific LE limits to shadow banking entities across the EU  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Another aspect that requires quicker implementation concerns the regulation of Central Counterparties   creating a true level playing field at the international level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I already mentioned the importance of the centralised settlement of securities transactions, including repos that are at the core of shadow banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.73,0)">These transactions are exempt from the regulatory minima recently published by the FSB because CCPs apply their own margin requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.25,0)">The essential questions concern the liquidity requirements that CCPs should implement and the not-yet solved problem of the resolution regime for CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">We are seeing a progressive significant concentration in the sector internationally and this accentuates the systemic nature of these institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.22,0)">An appropriate resolution regime that addresses the too-big-to-fail problem is becoming urgent and the ongoing work has to be accelerated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Another aspect of the regulation could be the possibility of giving to the macro-prudential authorities the power to set countercyclical margin add-ons which CCPs need to add to the minimum requirement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This may be most relevant in ebullient times when low volatility and reduced counterparty credit risk may lead to insufficient margin requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">When the financial cycle turns, macro-prudential add-ons can be released, ensuring higher shock absorbing capacity of CCPs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Concluding remarks The current process of structural change in the banking sector   will also have a permanent effect on the structure of intermediation in the euro area more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Banks have historically played a dominant role in the financing of the euro area real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">I expect that the future of intermediation will show some rebalancing away from the very high levels of bank-based intermediation towards more capital market-based intermediation of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">We have over the past few years already observed the start of such a rebalancing, as euro area banks have been deleveraging, while shadow banking entities, in particular investment funds, have expanded further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">This process is likely to continue in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">However, I do not think that this process should go too far and completely replicate the US structure as dominance of capital market-based financing brings opportunities but also brings more volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">From a financial stability perspective, a balanced mix between bank and non-bank banking is preferable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Non-bank banking can indeed have a number of benefits such as enlarging the real economy’s access to credit, supporting market liquidity and enabling sharing of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.57,0)">However, non-bank banking can also be a risk to the stability of the financial system  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.91,0)">As we observed in the early stages of the global financial crisis, some highly leveraged non-bank entities, such as the broker dealers in the US, held large amounts of illiquid assets and were vulnerable to investor runs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.86,0)">These led to fire sales of assets which in turn depressed asset valuations and caused a contagion of stress to regular banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">In order to adequately monitor such risks and prevent them from materialising, we need to have the data that allows for an adequate assessment of leverage in the overall financial system, as well as of liquidity, maturity mismatch, and the interconnectedness between institutions both inside and outside the regulated perimeter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Reducing contagion risk from shadow banks to the core banking sector is a challenge that requires permanent vigilance of the “boundary problem” and the use of the proper instruments to safeguard the overall stability of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">The outcome that we should strive for is to build the Sustainable Architecture for Finance in Europe  , surely a familiar concept here at the SAFE Policy Center of Goethe University.</span>
