    <h3> Speaker: Vítor Constâncio </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)"> Inequality and macroeconomic policies Intervention by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Annual Congress of the European Economic Association Lisbon, 22 August 2017 Ladies and gentlemen, It is indeed a pleasure to participate in this timely discussion on the distributional impact of macroeconomic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.67,0)">For too long, the distribution of income and wealth was almost ignored by macroeconomics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.84,0)">As recently recalled by Krusell, this is perhaps due to the “presumption in the literature that the distribution does not matter in the determination of aggregates”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.59,0)">In the 1990s, some studies underlined the end of the Kuznets’ phase of declining inequality and demonstrated that the trade-off between equality and growth no longer seemed to hold empirically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The analysis of distribution in macro theory was however not pursued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.84,0)">A possible second reason for the neglect, could have been that income distribution was not a macroeconomic concern, as it was mostly explained by micro factor price theory with the consequence that at the macro level, “trickle-down economics” would be the right approach to economic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.9,0)">These views were wrong and, naturally, the crisis shattered both presumptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">First, the contributions of Mian and Sufi, Carroll or Muellbauer  showed how relevant heterogeneities related to indebtedness, credit restrictions or marginal propensities to consume out of different sources of income or wealth, were important to explain aggregate consumption behaviour before and after the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Since then, the Heterogeneous Agents New Keynesian – HANK – class of models became an active area of research on the monetary policy transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">The recent contribution of Ahn, Kaplan, Moll, Winberry and Wolf   at the NBER Macroeconomics Annual Conference  titled “When inequality matters for Macro and Macro matters for inequality” demonstrates how significant the feedback loop is and how models with realistic household heterogeneity better fit empirical consumption dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Second, the social and political aftermath of the crisis have shown how important distribution of income and wealth as an economic policy issue is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In this respect, the seminal empirical and policy contributions of Atkinson, Piketty, Saez, Milanovic and others, were very relevant to make the point as they analysed the dynamics of the distributions of household income and wealth, across many countries and over many decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.15,0)">The shocking increase of inequality since the late seventies and the hollowing out of the middle class in many advanced economies, as showed in the famous “elephant graph” of Milanovic,  have focused minds on developments in inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The striking developments can be seen in Table 1 from Alvaredo et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Source: Alvaredo, F., L. Chancel, T. Piketty, E. Saez, and G. Zucman  , “Global inequality dynamics: new findings from WID.world”, NBER Working Paper 23119.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.43,0)">The data for the US from 1978 to 2015 show a cumulated decrease of 1% in the income of the bottom 50% of the population whereas the top 10% saw their income increase by 115% and the top 1% by 198%, a segment of the population that, by 2015, owned 20% of income and 40% of total US wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">The numbers for France are significantly less unbalanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.56,0)">In general, developments of inequality within European countries have been more subdued in recent decades than in other parts of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.78,0)">chartbookofeconomicinequality.com.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The series for Italy is "Per capita income" and that of the USA "Equivalised gross household income".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.76,0)">The first key fact shown in the chart is that, while income inequality has been steadily rising since the 1970s in the US and the UK, it has been quite stable in continental Europe or even declining as in France and Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">In particular since the 1990s, the Gini coefficient has been relatively stable in the European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Equally important, the chart documents that the bulk of the dynamics in inequality is driven by low-frequency developments driven by structural and institutional factors, rather than by shocks at the business-cycle frequency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">For example, the Gini coefficient on net wealth increased only modestly, from 68.0% in 2010 to 68.5% in 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.27,0)">Similarly, the share of the top 5% of households on total net wealth remained between 37% and 38%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Based on the evidence mentioned above, one could already draw some tentative implications for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">First, given the slow-moving nature of inequality, one could argue that the prevailing monetary policy regime, defining long term goals, is likely to be the most important factor through which central banks may influence the distribution of income and wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">For example, the conquest of inflation in countries going through prolonged experiences of high inflation is arguably an important factor contributing to the reduction in inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The second tentative implication is that, for a given monetary policy framework committed to a low inflation regime, the specific measures adopted to respond to cyclical developments are unlikely to significantly alter inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is useful to bear in mind these considerations when discussing a topic that has recently received much attention in the public debate, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.42,0)">how non-standard monetary policies, such as those undertaken in the recent years by the European Central Bank, affect the welfare of individual households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.3,0)">More specifically, to what extent non-standard monetary policies affect wealth inequality and income inequality in the short- and medium run?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Which households benefit from those policies and how much?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Despite the two tentative conclusions above, I do not intend to simply brush aside this debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.38,0)">Indeed, while measures such as the top shares and Gini coefficients are important to consider when thinking about inequality, they can sometimes mask specific dimensions of household heterogeneity, such as those along demographic or socioeconomic characteristics, which can be investigated in data from household surveys  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">For example, it is possible to analyse to what extent not only the Gini coefficients, but also income and wealth of individual households react to changes in the unemployment rate or to increased growth of wages and asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Let me provide some new empirical evidence on this topic based on ongoing work at the ECB by Lenza and Slacalek.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.67,0)">More specifically, they quantified how the ECB’s recent Asset Purchase Programmes   affected the income and wealth of individual households in the four largest euro area countries, combining aggregate and household-level data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.9,0)">First, they estimate the effects of the ECB’s unconventional monetary policy on components of household income and wealth using a Bayesian vector autoregression   which includes variables that affect wealth – house and stock prices – and variables that affect income – the unemployment rate and wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The APP shock is identified by assuming   that it affects the term-spread on impact, without leading to a change in standard monetary policy over the full sample  under analysis   and   that it has a positive effect on the real economy, on impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.76,0)">The shock is scaled to a term-spread reduction by 34 basis points, which is the estimated level of the impact of the announcement of the December 2016 APP package on the euro area 10-year bond rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.55,0)">This implies that the size of the impact considered in the estimates presented in the charts below is smaller than the total effect of our unconventional policies from 2014 to 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">The analysis is nevertheless representative and conclusive regarding the distributional impact of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The VAR estimated for the four largest euro area countries shows a degree of heterogeneity across the countries that can be taken as representative of the dispersion that would be found in all other euro area countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.98,0)">Responses are shown in percent for house prices, stock prices and wages; in percentage points for unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The APP purchases are estimated to increase house prices by more than 1% and stock prices by 0.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.96,0)">As for the variables, which affect household income  : the unemployment rate declines by roughly 0.7 percentage points, while wages rise somewhat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the second step, these aggregate results are combined with household-level data to estimate the effects of monetary policy on individual households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.49,0)">The HFCS provides detailed household-level data on income and wealth, but so far only for two waves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">However, since the bulk of the effect on wealth occurs via asset prices, we can assume that the response of individual wealth components to the APP after four quarters mirrors the response of asset prices at that horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The assumption seems acceptable given the short horizon we are considering and given the empirical evidence on the sluggishness of adjustment of holdings of real and also financial assets in household portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">As for net wealth,   Most quintiles increase by around 1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.87,0)">The median net wealth in the lowest quintile increases by 2.5% from a rather low level, from EUR 1120 to EUR 1150 and can in part be driven by the leverage of the households Similarly, the Gini coefficient on net wealth barely changes – it ticks down from 68.09 to 68.07.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">These results appear to be fully in line with my previous considerations based on the long-run evolution of inequality measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Another way of illustrating why the effect of APP on wealth distribution does not seem to have been significant is provided by the analysis in Adam and Tzamourani  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">They use the euro area average wealth composition by asset classes taken from the HFCS, and simulate the effects on the wealth distribution of an arbitrary increase of 10% in the prices of each asset class: housing, equities and bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.32,0)">The results are shown on   and P. Tzamourani  : "Distributional consequences of asset price inflation in the euro area", European Economic Review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.11,0)">The chart shows that the effect of housing prices on wealth dominates the impact both of equities or bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">It also illustrates that changes in housing prices reduce inequality in wealth distribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Bond price increases are fairly neutral and equity price variations aggravate inequality but their effect is smaller than the one from housing prices, at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The overall effect of APP on wealth distribution in the four countries analysed for the recent period in   The impulse responses give information about the aggregate response of the intensive   and the extensive   margin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.62,0)">To distribute the decline in the unemployment rate across households depending on their demographics  , a probit model is estimated at the country level with the employment status as the dependent variable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Such a model captures some heterogeneity in the probability of employment across households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.92,0)">The fitted values from the probit model are then used to run a simulation that distributes the aggregate decline in unemployment across households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.62,0)">Euro area aggregates are calculated as the total for the four large countries: Germany, Spain, France and Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.9,0)">The key point to note is that households with lower income are at any point in time substantially more likely to be unemployed and that their employment status also tends to react more significantly to monetary policy impulses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.73,0)">The aggregate decline in unemployment following the APP disproportionately impacts groups with a higher share of the unemployed, such as those in the lowest income quintile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.04,0)">The effect is economically important as in that quintile unemployment rates drop by more than 2 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.32,0)">For the remaining income quintiles the drop in the unemployment rates does not exceed 0.5 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.04,0)">These changes in the employment status affect the distribution of income and, overall, tend to compress income inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">This result confirms that, from the distributional perspective, the main impact of expansionary monetary policies is on the reduction of unemployment with positive effects on the reduction of inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">The positive overall effect of unemployment reductions and wage increases on the income distribution is shown on  5%, which is substantially higher than the impact in the rest of the distribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.17,0)">These changes have effects on the income distribution with the Gini coefficient on income declining from 43.1 to 42.8.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In conclusion, let me summarise these findings in two main points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">First, the effects of monetary policy on aggregate measures of inequality, such as the Gini coefficient are rather modest, compared to the low-frequency dynamics of these indicators over the past several decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.04,0)">This is more the case for household wealth than for income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.87,0)">In particular, non-standard monetary policy measures can have substantial income   effects for subgroups of households such as the unemployed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Those measures can improve their welfare and contribute toward reducing income disparities, at least in the short-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.06,0)">Second, the low-frequency dynamics in inequality is more likely affected by structural and institutional factors, such as skill-biased technological progress, economic globalisation and changes in the progressivity of fiscal systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In this context, those drivers may very well aggravate the situation as a result of further technological developments in artificial intelligence and robotisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.32,0)">The hollowing out of the middle class and the increasing polarisation of incomes in the labour market will presumably continue unabated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Education promotion or the introduction of a Universal Basic Income   will not change that trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">According to the OECD the UBI could even aggravate poverty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.08,0)">The Kuznets’ hypothesis , stating that as development progresses inequality first increases and then starts decreasing as income grows, was confirmed until the 1970s with inequality decreasing since the period before World War I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.39,0)">The increase of inequality since the 1970s however, has disproved the hypothesis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.84,0)">A subsequent Kuznets’ inequality decline phase, with the same causes of the first   seems quite unlikely at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.48,0)">On the other hand, according to Atkinson, Piketty or Milanovic, effective changes would require interventions at the level of market results by operating changes in endowments, which seem unlikely to happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.01,0)">Indeed, the type of measures they refer to could include wealth taxes, meaningful inheritance taxes, Employee Share Ownership Plans   and share distributions , birth endowments in the form of financial assets, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.57,0)">Most of these are seen by many economists as distortions detrimental to economic efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Usually, this concept refers to potential Pareto improvements occurring when the income winners could compensate the losers, even if they do not do it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.02,0)">These are usually referred to as “welfare enhancing” consequences which, obviously, do not include any considerations about distribution while pretend to be the basis of “scientific” economic advice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.93,0)">Maybe the normative word “welfare” in this narrow sense is an ambiguous misnomer that we should no longer use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.38,0)">This does not imply that economists should stop giving advice on economic efficiency and growth which are of course essential to reduce poverty and inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.87,0)">At the same time, we should be aware that all policies involve trade-offs and have distributional consequences, which are often forgotten or concealed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.04,0)">That is why Gunnar Myrdal underlined that economics could hardly be value neutral: He proposed that the only acceptable approach was for a researcher to disclose his values not hiding a pretense of science.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.65,0)">On this point, at the American Economic Association Annual Meeting in 1973, in a lecture about Thorstein Veblen, Kenneth Arrow reminded us that: “The world is indeed full of injustices and the writings of economists full of attempts to disguise them".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Unfortunately, this has continued to hold true for a long time but, hopefully, much has started to change over the last few years, in the aftermath of the crisis.</span>
