    <span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)"> Towards a political convergence process in the euro area Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Interparliamentary Conference “Towards a Progressive Europe”,Berlin, 16 October 2015 *** The effectiveness of the ECB’s action rests on the "M" in the EMU being kept free from political interference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">But for this to be secured in a lasting way, we need to further develop the "E", i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.2,0)">the economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.54,0)">In the past decade, intermediate solutions to save the euro area were found, but left the EMU still vulnerable to future crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Therefore, we need to define a new convergence process, involving converging economic structures and more integrated markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">This should be complemented by fully legitimate institutions with the right instruments to intervene if the consensus is not respected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This new convergence process will lead to higher resilience against economic shocks on a national level and European level, via internal and euro-wide adjustment mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">And it is a prerequisite before discussing a layer of fiscal stabilisation at the European level, which would protect monetary policy from bearing too much of the stabilisation burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But such a new convergence process cannot be a technical exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">For convergence to be lasting and to secure the buy-in of citizens and Member States, such a process needs to be political in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">This requires a revived political narrative for euro area integration, and a coherent European social contract that brings out the best in each national social contract.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">*** Honourable Members of Parliament, Ladies and gentlemen, Dear Group Vice-President Carsten  , Many thanks for your kind introduction and for having me here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">I am glad to see that Parliaments are at the forefront of the debate on the future of Economic and Monetary Union or EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.3,0)">You may wonder what an unelected central banker has to say about the political foundations of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">After all, the European Central Bank   is not a political institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Indeed, for our work to be effective, the “M” in EMU must be kept free from political interference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">But to secure this in the long term, we need to develop the “E”, so economic union, further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I will argue today that the political dimension of economic union will be crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.02,0)">Moving forward with passion and perspective Almost, one hundred years ago Max Weber famously described politics as “a strong and slow boring of hard boards which takes both passion and perspective” .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.19,0)">The board we want to drill into today, the future of EMU, is certainly one of the hardest and thickest, requiring not only passion but also an ability to cope with frustration – had you asked me in July and August about my passion for attending lengthy Eurogroup meetings, night-long negotiations and teleconferences, I would not have shown great enthusiasm; all too often, we lose perspective of what we want to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.22,0)">First, some people simply want EMU to be dismantled – either in its entirety or at least where their country is concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.0,0)">They can be found on both the left and right of the political spectrum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.94,0)">This is what I would call the “ostrich fallacy”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.39,0)">As a euro area country, you may theoretically give up your voice in the euro project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.33,0)">But you cannot forgo interdependence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.88,0)">We are too closely interlinked and frankly too small individually to solve problems alone in the face of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.79,0)">Sticking our heads in the sand will not make these facts go away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This was why we moved from fixed exchange rate regimes – which were more volatile, asymmetric and unpredictable than what we have today – to a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">And this single currency, as recent months have once again shown, is here to stay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.15,0)">Second, other people think that we can continue to muddle through with the architecture and arrangements that we have today, occasionally propped up by crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">They recall how much has been achieved over the last half-decade to shore up the construction of EMU, and they are right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.11,0)">But the developments over the summer, the state of our economy and the apparent problems implementing the new, recently agreed rules all point to the fact that what we have today is not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">We need to go beyond the quick fixes and intermediate solutions that were necessary, but insufficient to make EMU strong enough to weather future crises and to be the foundation for sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Third, there is the temptation to view a transfer of all important economic policy functions to the European level as the “silver bullet solution or, as Charles De Gaulle once said, to jump up and down on your chair like a goat kid bleating “Europe!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Europe!”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The argument goes as follows: If only Europe could help formulate the right policies and actively enforce those policies, the continent would prosper again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">And once our policy output improved, this would give the European project the legitimacy it had partly lost in the eyes of citizens in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.83,0)">Even we at the ECB are not immune to this temptation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.67,0)">But it would be unrealistic to cling to it too much for this is not an idea that European citizens are prepared to accept today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">So, today I want to propose that we move forward without losing perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">In particular, and in my view, this means moving forward economically and politically at the same time; moving towards more common decision-making regarding our economic policies while at the same time increasing the European legitimacy of this decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">A political narrative for EMU We should never forget that, at its heart, European integration has always been a political project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">When six countries decided in 1951 to unify their coal and steel markets, this was fuelled by the deep conviction that binding these countries together with a common destiny was the best way to avoid another war.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.88,0)">Europe was never first and foremost about economic functionalities and necessities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">In the same spirit, I am convinced that to take the next step in economic integration, we will need to revive the political narrative for European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">However, when we look at the past decade, we can appreciate that the need to move ahead was a direct consequence of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The European Stability Mechanism and its precursors – beginning with the bilateral loans to Greece in May 2010 – were established in response to an imperative imposed by the urgency of the situation; yet they have changed the nature of EMU forever and have emphasised how deeply interconnected we are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">The steps that came next – the strengthening of the governance framework, the fiscal compact, banking union – were the first manifestations of this change, and I know that many of you have actively contributed to these achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But they still very much followed the functional narrative of immediate crisis management and prevention, a narrative of functional necessity and not so much of political choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">These steps were essential for shoring up EMU and for showing the world that we were willing to do what is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">However, the basic set-up in terms of the allocation of competencies under the Maastricht framework has remained unchanged: labour market legislation, social protection schemes, tax policies, many aspects of the product markets, and the overwhelming majority of business environment factors, such as judicial systems, have remained within the remit of Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.05,0)">Incidentally, these policies are the most sensitive politically, while the policies that were perceived as more bureaucratic and technical in nature – monetary policy, standard-setting in the internal market, competition policy or financial legislation – were subsequently transferred to the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This initial allocation of tasks was also viewed by many as a way of protecting historically evolved and deeply embedded national, social and economic models and preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.68,0)">The crisis has shown, however, that this divide was all but artificial, that it did not address the spillover effects created by monetary union and, indeed, that it was not able to shield social contracts at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.1,0)">In fact, it made things worse: the crisis showed that sovereignty over economic policies cannot be exclusively national.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.22,0)">Sooner or later, pursuing policies that are inconsistent with being part of a monetary union will end in failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.28,0)">Like a boomerang, policy mistakes come back to haunt countries and their neighbours in a monetary union, because policies are interdependent, and because important adjustment tools are no longer to hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.51,0)">In our case, the boomerang took the form of bubbles bursting and loss of market access, followed by harsh macroeconomic adjustment programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">These programmes were necessary, and they worked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.38,0)">But they nevertheless came with economic, social and political price tags: economic and social, because implementing ad-hoc measures and the disorderly correction of imbalances always come at a greater cost than preventing imbalances in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.22,0)">And political, because drastic corrections have consequences for political stability; they challenge the legitimacy of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Going forward, there is thus a clear choice: either we engage in a debate and end up collectively deciding how our economic and social policies can form a coherent European social contract that brings out the best in each national social contract and renders these sustainable,   or we continue to rely on the premise that the most essential economic and social policies are decided at the national level alone and wait for the boomerang to come back again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">To my mind, this should not be a difficult call to make.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">But making this call and moving forward without losing perspective will mean progressing beyond the functional narrative that has, in my view, reached its limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">It will require, once more, a clear political narrative to justify why drawing closer together is not only necessary, but is actually a good idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In particular, such a narrative should demonstrate that, when we speak about more Europe, this does not mean that our cherished European social model is under attack; rather, more Europe is precisely what can protect and sustain the social achievements that set us apart from the rest of the world and that can help to further develop our social model to cope with the challenges of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.77,0)">Conceptualising this kind of political narrative is, by definition, not the role of a technocrat; it is your job, not mine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">But I would like to provide you with some reasons why I believe that a new political and economic convergence process as proposed in the Five Presidents’ Report   could lead you to such a narrative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Towards a political and economic convergence process A “convergence process 2.0”   should foster convergence, not towards nominal targets this time, but towards a similar level of resilience for economic structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">“Resilience” is to be understood here both at the level of individual countries   and at the level of the euro area as a whole  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Yet, in order to foster not only economic convergence and, moreover, go beyond this to create political convergence and lasting buy-in through a new political narrative, requires a process that is both economic and political.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What would be the key features of the economic dimension of the process?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In my view, a small number of simple, but important conditions would need to be met, namely a) consensus on designating economic policies as a shared competence; b) agreement on which policy areas should be subject to convergence; and c) a mechanism ensuring that convergence will continue beyond the end of the initial process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">If these conditions are fulfilled, a “convergence process 2.0” would not only be an effective instrument for preventing and managing imbalances and macroeconomic risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">In my view, it would also be a precondition for adding a layer of fiscal stabilisation at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Sufficient convergence in terms of resilience could help Member States to deal with asymmetric shocks without leading to permanent transfers in one direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is a necessity in a mature monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It protects monetary policy from bearing a disproportionate share of the economic stabilisation burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.95,0)">It also avoids what I have referred to elsewhere as “structural dominance” over fiscal policy, which amounts to fiscal policies being forced to do all the heavy lifting to stabilise the economy and, over time, to fiscal space becoming progressively exhausted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.28,0)">This overreliance on fiscal policy can in turn lead to dominance of fiscal policy over monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">But we should not be fooled: common fiscal policies will be neither economically desirable nor politically feasible without a successful economic convergence process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Nor should we make the mistake of believing that they can replace the need to conduct sound fiscal policies at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">On the contrary, building trust and creating symmetry through conducting sound domestic policies and enhancing market-based adjustment capacities will be a necessary condition for moving forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Indeed, this is why a forceful and thorough implementation of the current framework – the Fiscal Compact, Stability and Growth Pact, Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure and Country Specific Recommendations – is indispensable for future progression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But how should the conditions I have just outlined be translated into action?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I believe that this is where we need to go beyond the functional narrative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.09,0)">Why is this the case?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">As I stated at the beginning, there is a significant temptation to devise such a convergence process with a sole focus on output legitimacy: experts determine the relevant policy areas and the right policies, and a new strong independent institution enforces them afterwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">This would then lead to sound policy outcomes which would legitimise the process after the event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But this would bring us back to the functional narrative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.55,0)">Indeed, a new convergence process cannot be a technical exercise for two reasons: first, the matters under discussion – be they labour market institutions, taxation, or the organisation of the judicial system and administrative capacity – are inherently political and much closer to the day-to-day life of citizens than, for example, monetary policy ever will be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Second, an institutional architecture in a democratic system cannot be based mainly on coercion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.85,0)">After all, in our everyday lives we do not follow rules because we constantly fear punishment, but because we believe in the purpose of the rules and understand that they can only work if adherence to them is the norm, not the exception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">We need a process that ensures the buy-in of citizens, governments and parliaments, that fosters a broad debate concerning our common understanding of what economic policies in a monetary union should look like, and that, for the most part, works based on consent to a common framework and provides fully legitimate institutions with the right instruments to intervene if the consensus is not respected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This kind of political convergence process represents an opportunity: it could lead us to the political narrative I mentioned before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">But for that to emerge we would need to develop a common understanding of economic policies – it could mean that national parliaments and the European Parliament need to speak to each other more, as we are doing today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.98,0)">If we were to commit to such a process, there would be a political cost to pay upfront as this would mean admitting to citizens that national parliaments alone cannot address all future challenges on their own anymore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But let us acknowledge that there is no such thing as a free lunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">This political cost is precisely the visible measure of collective commitment to the single currency project, which is necessary to ensure the economic and political resilience of EMU in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">European political parties could be a catalyst for such a debate – by organising more discussions than they do now, not along national lines, but according to social preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This could also mean that social partners would need to go beyond their national remit and adopt a European perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.57,0)">Conclusion The outcome of this kind of process would certainly not be optimal from a purely economic standpoint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">That is a key feature of democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">But it would be legitimate; it would not have to rely on its outcome alone to be acceptable, and it would give citizens a clear indication as to why we must move forward together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">In my view, this would be a major achievement that would provide the political underpinning for EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">It would not only create a more stable environment for growth and prosperity; it would also allow us, as a central bank, to conduct our monetary policy in an environment of much greater certainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">In the end, the more developed the “E” in EMU, the better we can do our job on the “M” side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">What I have proposed today is an opportunity for politics to reconnect with what matters most to our citizens; and an opportunity for Europe to move forward in the Weberian sense, with both passion and perspective, preserving what we have in common while accommodating differences where these are an asset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">This would indeed be faithful to the model of the European Union – united in diversity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Thank you very much for listening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">, “Politics as a Vocation” in Gerth,
