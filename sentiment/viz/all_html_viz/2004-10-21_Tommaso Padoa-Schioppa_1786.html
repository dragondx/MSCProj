    <span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)"> Enlargement and “old” Europe: Blow or Blessing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Speech by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Frankfurt am Main, 21 October 2004 Introduction Less than six months have elapsed since our European family has become one of twenty-five.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.74,0)">When some years ago we decided that the third ECB Central Banking conference would be on so-called enlargement  , this event seemed a long way off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Now we are at the beginning of a new and very exciting challenge that will be with us for years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Speaking about the economic dimension of this challenge, we are well aware of the anxieties and fears that have been expressed by both the fifteen and the ten countries that now form one single family.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.65,0)">A typical anxiety among the fifteen took the form of the question: “are they ready for us?”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">It refers to the readiness of the ten in terms of transformation of their economy, robustness of the market structure, and real and nominal convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.95,0)">In addition, and somewhat paradoxically, there were concerns in form of the question “will we cope?” relating to the fear that for the very affluent, and supposedly very orderly, economic and social system of western Europe, the accession of an entire population almost as large as that of Germany but with low wages, low living standards, a high level of education, could be a blow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.9,0)">Given the fatigue and pessimism that pervades certain areas of western Europe today, enlargement has often been seen as a danger rather that an opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Tonight, I will plead for the opposite and argue that for the fifteen the arrival of the ten could be a blessing rather than a blow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Economic governance Let me start by pointing out that the European Union’s economic governance is undoubtedly a cooperative arrangement between Member States, but one that leaves a very large role to competition among them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.02,0)">This not only relates to competition between products or firms, but also between policies or even countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Indeed, the deep sense of uniting Europe is not to eradicate sentiments of patriotism or national ambition, but to channel the energy embedded in those sentiments into the mechanism of competition, turning it away from the mechanism of conflict and even war.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">For this taming to happen, strong cooperation and strong institutions are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">But for dynamism and creativity to remain alive, the engine of local and national ambitions is equally necessary, welcome, and legitimate, provided that the motor turns in compliance with the Rule of Law or, put more simply, with “fair play”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Both the Council and the Commission are expected to ensure “fair play”, not to put a tap on competition among nations, regions, policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Their role is to make competition both possible and benign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Policy competition is particularly necessary given the current situation in western Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.21,0)">This is so because much of what western Europe has suffered in the last ten or fifteen years is a lack of dynamism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.54,0)">We have often been blocked by a more or less tacit agreement among Member States not to unleash the forces of competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">It is in this context that the arrival of ten new members can   be a significant blessing, not a blow, for the old fifteen and hence to the whole family of twenty-five.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is the single message I wish to deliver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me illustrate this by making a few quick points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.52,0)">Neither the fifteen nor the ten are homogeneous groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.04,0)">I will nevertheless compare them as if they were, to avoid this speech becoming a fifty-minute lecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.66,0)">Labour mobility and wage competition The first point concerns labour mobility and migration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.12,0)">During the accession negotiations the fear of mass migration led to a seven-year postponement of the free movement of workers from the new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">A more courageous attitude could have suggested that labour mobility is entirely desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The free circulation of persons is, after all, one of the four freedoms established by the Treaty, and labour mobility is what we normally preach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">This is all the more so, in view of demographic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.13,0)">If anything, one would expect the fears and reservations about migration to come from new EU members, not from the old ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Throughout history, migration has been a major factor of change, innovation, and dynamism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Even today, labour mobility and migration remain crucial for the economic development of both the home and the host countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Through the so-called “kidnap” of the Sabine women some twenty-five centuries ago, the mainly male population of ancient Rome was given the demographic push from which arose the global role of the city.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In the 16th and 17th centuries, the inflow of industrious and highly educated immigrants was a main source of the economic success of England, Holland, and Prussia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.94,0)">In many cases, active policies were indeed to attract foreign craftsmen and forbid the emigration of skilled workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.29,0)">On occasion, craftsmen were literally kidnapped, much like Sabine women.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">In Spain, where over the last ten years migrant workers have increasingly filled low-paid jobs and, according to a study by the Banco de España, have contributed substantially to growth, the government has now decided to grant residence permits to migrant workers already living in the country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.42,0)">The problem with labour mobility, of course, is that discussions have often little to do with true benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.16,0)">A bit like with free trade, while economists or historians argue in its favour, irrational fears and doomsday scenarios appear in the public arena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">In spite of the seven-year delay, there is a positive side to all this: the fear of labour mobility shows that the heat of competition in the labour market is felt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The prospect of larger movements of workers can thus act as a catalyst for much needed labour market reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.34,0)">Critics speak of a “grey labour market”, where migrant workers operate often with minimum protection and low wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.8,0)">True, this is not what the free movement of workers in the EU should be about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.74,0)">But it should also be said that the grey market is often the symptom of an “official” labour market that is too rigid to function properly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.82,0)">Industrial relocation and outsourcing My second point concerns industrial relocation and outsourcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.35,0)">As countries become richer, the share of industry in output and employment declines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This trend was under way in Europe throughout the post-war period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Resources are re-deployed, mainly in the higher value service sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Labour market flexibility is a key aspect in this respect and in some areas the ten have the upper hand in the EU of twenty-five.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.35,0)">Among the ten, unemployment benefit systems tend to be more employment-friendly, replacement ratios are generally lower and benefits are granted for shorter periods than in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.32,0)">There is a relatively low coverage of collective bargaining, reflecting generally decentralised levels of bargaining   and low levels of union membership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.64,0)">Unit labour costs are also lower: they are about one-third of the EU15 average in the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary and Latvia, about one-half in Poland and one-quarter in Lithuania and Slovakia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">According to a recent report by the Boston Consulting Group, a manufacturer of car parts in Germany could save 30 per cent by moving production to Poland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">It appears that even moving from Spain, which is still catching up, would be quite profitable, allowing savings in the order of 24 per cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Partly thanks to lower shipping costs for goods intended for European markets, central Europe may well be a cheaper manufacturing base than, say, Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.06,0)">The consequences are visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">The Slovak Republic, for example, is now home to a number of sizeable car manufacturing plants and over time it may become the Detroit of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">But western European companies are also using the new EU members in central and eastern Europe as a location from which to provide services, such as customer call centres and back-office and IT operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The Czech Republic, for example, already a big destination for manufacturing investments, is now attracting service sector projects because of its strong telecoms infrastructure, good transport connections, and a cheap but skilled workforce, proficient in languages and technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Since 1999, FDI inflows in the Czech and Slovak Republics have averaged almost 9 per cent of GDP, against 3.3 per cent in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.96,0)">Tax system My third point is tax competition, which is quite a thorny issue, one where – not surprisingly – politicians sound distinctly less competition-oriented than the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">A number of new Member States, and in particular the Baltic countries, have carried out what is virtually a textbook version of an effective tax policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">First, their tax systems are very transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Second, their tax burdens are generally low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.99,0)">Third, they have avoided steep progressivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.01,0)">As for personal income taxes, top marginal rates are around 25 per cent in Estonia and Latvia and between 30 and 40 per cent in most other new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the EU15 they are around 50 per cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.49,0)">As for corporate taxes, in many new Member States rates are between 15 and 25 per cent, with the Baltic States at the lower end of this range, and some countries have announced further reductions for the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">From both a theoretical and practical point of view, we know that such tax systems are conducive to strong economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">If lower tax rates in the new Member States were to put pressure for tax reform in the euro area, as the lower tax rates in Ireland have already done, this could only be for our benefit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.67,0)">Arguments about unfair tax competition should not be used as a smokescreen to distract attention from what every citizen in the euro area knows: that tax regimes need to change, and fiscal pressure has to fall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Other factors Labour mobility, industrial relocation and tax systems are among the major factors that need to be changed in western Europe, with the new ten being in the position to lead the change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But there are other factors as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.93,0)">One is the size of countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">For many years we have observed the rather surprising fact that small tends   to be beautiful, also for Member States in the European Union: lower unemployment, lower deficit, greater flexibility, better overall performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">One explanation is that economic realism and acceptance of the logics of policy competition meet less resistance in small countries than they do in large countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The large countries often still entertain the illusion of self-sufficiency, national champions, and the like.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Now, the recent enlargement has brought an unusually big proportion of small members into the EU family: six of the ten have a smaller population than Ireland, which is, apart from Luxembourg, the smallest of the fifteen, population-wise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.12,0)">This may well mean that the mind frame around tables such as those of the Council of Ministers may become more competition-oriented than was previously the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.59,0)">Those who are fearful of the blow, rather than hopeful of the blessing, would object by saying that a family of twenty-five is very, very hard to manage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Thinking back to when I participated in Ecofin meetings of an EC of nine countries, I am now amazed by the hundreds of persons attending Ecofin meetings today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.58,0)">Undoubtedly the risk of paralysis exists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But an Italian proverb says: “non tutto il male viene per nuocere”,   or, in English, “every cloud has a silver lining”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">It may happen – and this is indeed my expectation – that the very risk of paralysis will impose more efficient decision-making practices and speedier rules of procedures upon the family, practices and procedures that we could afford to refuse when the family was small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Conclusion The points above illustrate an overall theme: the pressure of competition from the ten is a potential blessing for structural reforms in the old part of the EU, a part of Europe that for so long has recognised the need for them, but has not fully implemented them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Many of the ten went through a transformation process, which in many respects comes very close to the programme of structural reform that every sensible person advocates for the fifteen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Their transition process has meant that they have been living with rapid and relentless change for many years now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">In many ways, this experience makes them less resistant to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">They are fit, we are fat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Of course, this is not to say that the new entrants have no problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.77,0)">Labour-shedding during the transition process has left its marks in the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.8,0)">Rigid structures and red tape is still a problem in more than one country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Yet, new members have, on different occasions, shown that they have been able to do what many euro area countries have not managed to do in the past decade: to fundamentally modernise institutional arrangements in their economies in order to make them more growth supportive and better capable of dealing with economic change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.44,0)">Are there indications that competition from the new members is already at work?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Perhaps there are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.58,0)">The World Bank annual report on regulatory burden called “Doing Business”, covers 145 countries, and looks at regulatory reforms relating to businesses, such as starting a business, hiring and firing workers, enforcing a contract, getting credit and closing a business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The 2003 Report placed Slovakia, Lithuania and Poland at the “top ten” list of reformers in terms of regulation of business, stating that “accession countries reformed ahead of the competitive pressures in the larger European Market”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.83,0)">The Report also placed Belgium, Finland, Portugal and Spain among the top ten reformers, suggesting that these euro area countries are increasingly feeling the pressure from the countries of central and eastern Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.78,0)">Let me conclude by moving from after-dinner scenarios to working-day realisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The blow-blessing alternative should not be seen from the angle of predicting, but rather from that of acting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The future is open and this is why policy, responsibility, freedom, exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.57,0)">It depends on us whether the opportunity will be seized.</span>
