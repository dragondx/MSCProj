    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.04,0)"> Monetary policy – what’s next?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.86,0)">Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Eurofi Financial Forum, Tallinn, 15 September 2017 Monetary policy has changed significantly since the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">For many years we have pursued a highly expansionary monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">During that time, monetary policy has also become quite unconventional; we have deployed a range of different non-standard measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But now, markets, banks and savers are waiting for it to become more conventional again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">And there’s no doubt that monetary policy will return to normal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.91,0)">The question is when.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">That is the first challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We need to find the right moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The conditions are all in place for inflation to reach a stable trend towards our goal: below, but close to, 2% in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The conditions for that are all in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Growth has returned to the euro area, and so have jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.19,0)">We can look back on 17 quarters of economic growth and an unemployment rate that has fallen from around 12% to around 9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">This has given a boost to demand; people have started spending again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">And the recovery is not confined to a few countries; it has taken hold across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Given all of that, inflation should pick up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">And it is picking up, but less quickly than one would expect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.08,0)">So what is holding it back?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.51,0)">Well, there are a couple of things – oil and commodity prices, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">They suppress headline inflation and make it more volatile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.68,0)">And they also affect core inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.36,0)">And there is another issue: the headline unemployment rate seems to miss some of the slack in the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.56,0)">So the economy might be a bit further away from full potential than would appear to be the case at first sight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">That, of course, holds inflation down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.19,0)">At the same time, a long period of low inflation has an impact on how wages and prices are set.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.65,0)">This is particularly problematic when prices and wages are indexed to inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This effect should wash out over time, though.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">In any case, we can conclude that inflation is taking a bit longer than usual to pick up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">So some monetary accommodation is still needed to bring inflation back on a stable trend towards our goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">But to a large extent, this accommodation is being provided by the standard monetary policy measures and by the stock of bonds that we have already bought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">So even when we phase out our net purchases of bonds, the accommodation will still remain in place and be sufficient to ensure the necessary support to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">The buoyant growth coupled with the monetary accommodation will take us back to an inflation rate which is in line with our goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">There’s little doubt about that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.6,0)">Hence, it is time to take a decision now on scaling back our bond purchases at the beginning of next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And this point leads to a second challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">We need to think about how to bring our unconventional measures to an end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We need to look ahead and discuss what the exit might look like.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I am aware that this requires us to communicate very carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">On the one hand, we must help markets to get an idea of what the exit will look like.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.67,0)">On the other hand, we mustn’t confuse them with vague or ambiguous ideas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.91,0)">It’s a delicate balance we have to strike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">And in my view, we need to find this balance now.</span>
