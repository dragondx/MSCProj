    <span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)"> Greece: progress, challenges and the way forward Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a conference organised by The Economist: “Greece: a comeback to the financial markets?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">A glimpse into Europe’s financial landscape”, Frankfurt am Main, 31 May 2017 Thank you for inviting me to speak here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The topic of this conference is very timely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">As you know, in recent weeks the Greek authorities have made significant progress in adopting measures to finalise the second review of the ESM programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Discussions on medium-term debt measures and a new IMF programme are ongoing and expected to be concluded in the weeks ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In my short remarks this morning, I will explain why timely clarity on debt measures and debt sustainability is important – not only to restore trust in public finances but also to help rebuild confidence in the Greek economy more generally, and the financial sector in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">But I would first like to focus on one element of the Greek adjustment programme where I believe the ECB’s advice is of particular relevance – the financial sector strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Financial sector reforms are a key element of macroeconomic adjustment programmes, for one simple reason: any sustainable economic recovery needs to be supported by an adequate supply of credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.17,0)">Without credit, firms may not be able to invest in productive capital, create new employment or cover ongoing expenses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">A healthy credit supply is also important for our monetary policy to filter through to households and firms: it is one of the main ways in which we can affect bank lending conditions and, ultimately, price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Indeed, the broad-based and solid recovery we are currently observing in the euro area economy owes much to our policy measures having been effective in repairing the bank lending channel – that is, in overcoming credit supply restrictions and in bringing bank lending rates down to levels consistent with our monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.6,0)">Greece is a sad exception, unfortunately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.03,0)">Bank loans to the domestic non-financial private sector have contracted in every quarter since end-2008 and by a cumulative 28% up until the end of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">And although the level of loans to the private sector has stabilised recently, rates on loans to firms are still some 250 basis points above the current euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Main challenges for the Greek financial sector This means, of course, that there is still important work to do to allow credit to become a net contributor – rather than an impediment – to growth in Greece and to allow the Greek economy to reap the full benefits of the firming and broadening euro area recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">But still, we have seen progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The situation of Greek banks has improved in several ways since the summer of 2015 when the third programme was negotiated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Capital adequacy, for example, has been strengthened from CET1 ratios of around 11% in the third quarter of 2015 to around 16-17% at the end of last year, following the successful recapitalisation of the four main banks in late 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Bank governance has also improved, as shown by the significant changes in the composition of Greek bank boards over the past year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">And, importantly, bank profitability recovered in 2016 after years of substantial losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The average return on assets improved from -1.9% in 2015 to 0.1% in 2016, based on continued operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">What, then, are the main obstacles that still need to be overcome?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.45,0)">I would argue that they are mainly related to the fragile state of banks’ balance sheets – on both the asset and liability sides.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me start with the asset side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.7,0)">As you know, non-performing loans   are a problem in many euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.74,0)">But in Greece 45% of all bank loans are non-performing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.77,0)">They severely depress the profitability of banks and their ability to extend new, productive loans to firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Decisive and rapid action is therefore needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.59,0)">The roadmap was drawn up last year when ECB Banking Supervision agreed with the four main Greek banks on a 50% reduction in their NPL stock by the end of 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Progress so far has been broadly in line with agreed targets, but NPL objectives for this year and the next two years are ambitious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.8,0)">A step change in NPL resolution activities will be needed – in particular after the weak performance in the first months of 2017 that was, in part, also due to the uncertainties related to the delay in the second review.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">But I am happy to see that the Greek authorities recently passed several important pieces of legislation to support NPL resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Full and timely implementation of these reforms in the months ahead will be crucial to support the required step change in NPL resolution efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Let me highlight three elements that are of particular importance: First, the overhaul of the out-of-court workout framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This element is of particular importance in Greece, where many firms are heavily indebted both to banks and the state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Second, legal provisions to facilitate debt restructuring agreements by reducing the liability of the individuals involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">And third, after many delays, a framework for electronic auctions for the recovery of claims.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.69,0)">An electronic auction platform has become increasingly important as physical auctions have essentially come to a standstill, which has caused significant losses for creditors, debtors and the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.64,0)">Let me now briefly turn to the liability side of banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Deposits are the cornerstone of any sound banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">A stable deposit base allows banks to engage in maturity transformation and to extend credit to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">So far, however, there is no evidence of a sustained return of private deposits in Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Since the summer of 2015, when capital controls were imposed, private sector deposits have only recorded a modest 2.5% increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.89,0)">They remain some 25% below their levels at the end of 2014 before deposit outflows accelerated noticeably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The upshot is that Greek banks still rely to a significant extent on central bank funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.06,0)">Although recourse to our facilities, including emergency liquidity assistance, has fallen from 41% of total assets in June 2015 to around 21% of assets today, total central bank funding still amounts to more than 35% of Greek GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Part of the reduction in central bank funding is attributable to improved access to wholesale financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This is certainly good news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Greek banks have gradually returned to the interbank market and were able to perform repo transactions with a wide range of mostly international counterparties – also thanks to the ECB, in June last year, reinstating the waiver affecting the eligibility of Greek government-related assets for Eurosystem monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">But for credit to become a vital source of economic growth in Greece again, a lot will depend on banks being able to regain the trust of private depositors and rebuild stable funding lines in wholesale funding markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.19,0)">Of course, this is not only in the hands of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Broader macroeconomic stabilisation is essential, as I will explain in a second.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">But banks need to contribute actively to this process by making further progress in repairing the asset side of their balance sheets – that is, by reducing the amount of non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Debt sustainability and the public sector purchase programme Restoring confidence, of course, also means dispelling uncertainty about the sustainability of Greek government debt – and this brings me back to my opening remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.87,0)">I think we all agree that uncertainty about high public debt levels has undermined confidence in the Greek economy in general, and the financial system in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In this respect, we regret that no clear definition of debt relief measures was reached at the last Eurogroup meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Discussions are ongoing, but in my view it is important that an agreement is reached at the Eurogroup meeting on 15 June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">According to the framework agreed in May last year, debt measures would be implemented in mid-2018, at the end of the programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">But being sufficiently clear on the measures today would help frontload many of the beneficial effects, in particular the rebuilding of confidence of both the international and domestic community in the ability of the Greek economy to return to a path of normality and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Clarity about debt measures is also a necessary condition for Greek government bonds to be potentially eligible under the ECB’s public sector purchase programme  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">In June last year, the Governing Council clarified that it would examine possible purchases of Greek government bonds under the PSPP, taking into account the progress made in the analysis and reinforcement of Greece’s debt sustainability, as well as other risk management considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Any decision by the Eurosystem will be taken independently and autonomously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">This means that one important element in our deliberations is our assessment of the sustainability of Greece’s public debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">But we can only make an informed assessment if we have a clear view of the nature and extent of the envisaged debt measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Then we can assess how much they would contribute to the sustainability of Greek debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In other words, we need a sufficient degree of specificity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And as for any other decisions, we will look at all the relevant information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The IMF’s debt sustainability analysis will be an important input in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Concluding remarks Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">To bring the Greek programme to a successful conclusion it is essential that the Greek authorities continue to show a serious commitment to the goals set and measures taken in the context of the programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Only with such a commitment can all stakeholders be confident that reforms will be strengthened in the aftermath of the programme and not reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">At the same time, other stakeholders have to do their part to put in place the conditions that will ultimately allow the Greek banking system to fully recover and to enable the country to return to the financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">These efforts are not only about Greece – they are also about the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Based on currently available information, Greece is the only euro area country whose economy contracted, albeit marginally, at the start of this year, despite the cyclical recovery becoming increasingly solid and broad-based – thanks in large part to our monetary policy measures, which have led to a pronounced easing of financing conditions and a convergence of funding costs across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">But convergence will only be achieved if all euro area countries are involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">I therefore encourage all parties to continue working hard on making the programme a complete success.</span>
