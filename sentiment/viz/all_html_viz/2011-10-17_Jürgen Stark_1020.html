    <h2> Introductory statement by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Brussels, 17 October 2011 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jürgen Stark </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)"> Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Brussels, 17 October 2011 Dear Madam Chair, Dear Honourable Members, It is a pleasure to be here today and share with you my thoughts on Economic Governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">This public hearing comes at a right time: important decisions have been taken, but major reforms are still crucially needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will therefore address, in turn, the three suggested issues for discussion: the implementation of the economic governance package, the longer term reforms in the economic governance framework and the question of Eurobonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Follow-up and implementation of the economic governance package I would like to start by congratulating this committee on the passage of the six pack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The adoption of a reinforced economic governance framework shows the ability of EU decision makers to address some of the shortcomings of the existing rules which came to light during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">In the current situation of market turmoil and uncertainty, it sends a signal of confidence to EU citizens and financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The final text provides for a stronger framework than initially proposed by the Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And this is largely thanks to Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Once again this committee has used its powers to instil a more European and supranational approach in economic governance, which is incidentally very much in line with the ECB position, and I would like to thank you for that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">As you know, I have a strong attachment – to say the least – to a set of binding, quasi-automatic fiscal rules which need to underpin the sharing of a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The “new” Stability and Growth Pact all SGP III – if it can be called this way – should strengthen fiscal surveillance and enforcement of fiscal discipline in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Equally important, reinforced the statistical governance needs to be part and parcel of the framework, and important progress also in this regard is the merit of this Committee’s intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">The new macroeconomic surveillance framework represents an important addition to the EU surveillance toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The scoreboard is a key element in this  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me stress that the scoreboard is a means to an end – namely the detection of macroeconomic imbalances that threaten the proper functioning of monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The scoreboard should remain focused and concise to draw the attention of the policy makers and the broader public to the emergence of macroeconomic imbalances at an early point in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Let me be frank: the governance package is an important step forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.26,0)">But, and this is unfortunately a big “but”, it still leaves a large room for discretion in the execution and enforcement of the surveillance procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The effectiveness of tools and measures that are thankfully contained in the six pack, is contingent on their implementation, not just in letter, but also in spirit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.57,0)">The track record on implementing the surveillance mechanisms is less than stellar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This applies to both the Commission in presenting sufficiently strong proposals and recommendations, and the Council in exerting peer pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.72,0)">I see, therefore, high “implementation risks”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.05,0)">The many exceptions and relevant or special factors that need to be taken into account at different stages of the procedure unfortunately reinforce these doubts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Therefore, the ECB regrets that one of the key aspects of the quantum leap in economic governance that it was advocating – greater automaticity in decision-making through the use of reverse qualified majority voting to the maximum extent possible – was only partly achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">I call also on this Committee to use the new tools that are at its disposal, such as the ‘economic dialogue’, to enhance transparency and promote peer pressure and market discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Equally, the European Semester should be improved further, to make a useful tool of ex ante surveillance, and the ongoing discussion Parliament can exert pressure in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Ultimately, however, what really needs to change is the mindset of all parties involved in surveillance: they have to assume the full responsibility for the smooth functioning of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This means internalising what it means to be part of monetary union, exerting strong peer pressure when necessary, and being ready to take the guidance received from their peers or the supranational institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The real question is whether this more fundamental change can come about without some more fundamental shifts in competencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.8,0)">As Jean Monnet, who is probably often cited in this House, said “I have too often observed the limits of coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is a method which promotes discussion, but it does not lead to a decision.” And yet the management of the euro area economy needs effective decisions, and not just inconsequential discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This leads me to my second point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Longer term reforms in the economic governance framework Current developments clearly show the need to reach a new quality of EMU governance by going well beyond the scope of the economic governance package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">We need a genuine economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">I trust the EP will use the review clause included in the package to enable further enhancements to the euro area economic governance that will contribute to a smoother functioning of EMU, for instance by introducing greater automaticity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In my view, more fundamental deepening of fiscal and economic policy surveillance is necessary in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This will involve a transfer of sovereignty to the European level with much stronger powers and will necessitate stricter constraints on national budget policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Those reforms will require a comprehensive Treaty change but above all, an adequate mechanism to ensure their democratic legitimacy through the appropriate involvement of the European Parliament and the national parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Let me outline the cornerstones of such a governance reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">To ensure fiscal discipline, all planned deficits of more than 3% of GDP and those in excess of a country’s medium term objective would be approved by all euro area governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Past fiscal slippages would be automatically corrected in upcoming budgets without any room for discretion via the introduction of constitutional rules similar to the German “debt brake”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">All Member States would also agree to implement full automaticity regarding fines and sanctions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.03,0)">Moreover, countries under macroeconomic adjustment programmes in the context of ESM assistance and which fail to remain on track would be placed under financial receivership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">And finally, the institutional arrangements at both national and supranational level have to be strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">At the national level, independent budget offices would ensure reliable forecasts – a prerequisite for sound planning and implementation of budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">At the euro area level this needs to be complemented by an independent entity with a clear mandate and a strong institutional framework to assess the implementation of fiscal rules, for instance some form of European Budget Office.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The “EBO” could potentially form the nucleus of what could become over time and in a step wised manner a European Ministry Finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Strong and independent institutions at euro area and national levels enhance transparency and add pressure to conduct sound policies, as well as effectively counteract possible tendencies towards a lenient implementation of fiscal rules at the level of individual member states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Issuing common bonds in the euro area Further strengthening of economic governance is a must.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Do not be mistaken that there is an alternative “silver bullet” that will resolve the current crisis and prevent future ones, such as the issuing of Eurobonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Given that one of the root causes of the current sovereign debt crisis are unsustainable fiscal policies, I want to emphasise that this calls for a clear strengthening of incentives for prudent and sustainable fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.47,0)">The introduction of common bonds in the euro area would, however, clearly weaken such incentives without offering a long-term crisis resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Let me give you three main reasons for that: Firstly, the fact that financial markets demand higher yields to fund governments with weak fundamentals clearly provides the right incentives for governments to ensure sustainable finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Credible fiscal consolidation and prudent levels of government debt are in general rewarded, whereas large budget deficits and mounting government debt are penalized in the form of high credit risk premiums.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Eurobonds would eliminate this incentive mechanism as governments would face the same funding costs regardless of the state of their public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Secondly, the introduction of Eurobonds would also not lead to lowering the costs of the current sovereign debt crisis; it would simply redistribute them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Common euro area bonds imply a transfer from countries with solid public finances – as they will no longer benefit from lower funding costs - to those with weak ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Unsustainable fiscal positions can no longer be punished by high credit risk premiums.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.07,0)">This redistribution aggravates exiting moral hazard problems and undermines the long-term fiscal sustainability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">On top of this, via common bonds strong and weak countries enter into mutual obligations of very large size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.56,0)">This carries the risk that the sound countries will be taken hostage, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">to accept a gradual erosion of commonly agreed fiscal rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Thirdly, it is not clear at all whether an introduction of Eurobonds would really help to resolve the sovereign debt crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Part of the government debt in the euro area would of course be converted into common euro area bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The remaining part will, however, still need to be funded the old-fashioned way – by means of standard sovereign bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.51,0)">Whether financial market participants would be willing to buy and hold sovereign bonds of countries with weak fundaments is by far not sure, also given the current level of risk aversion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.5,0)">In an extreme case, we might see a complete flight out of individual sovereign bonds towards Eurobonds, which would rather lead to a worsening of the sovereign debt crisis and not to its resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.76,0)">Eurobonds do not offer a solution of the sovereign debt crisis and are not a viable instrument of government financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Maybe it is worth remembering that all the proposals I have seen so far for Eurobonds are, at the heart, governance proposals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">None of them can do with out massively reinforced governance or outright sovereignty transfers to the supernational level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The more appropriate way to look at Eurobonds is to start with governance: Only with a fundamental shift of our structures in the European Union – towards a real political union – could one conceivably create incentive and governance conditions that are commensurate with the issuance of common bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Before talking about Eurobonds, we should identify the necessary reforms that focus on the ultimate objective: institutional arrangements which provide credible incentives for sound fiscal and economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Dear Chair, Honourable Members,</span>
