    <span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)"> Building the Future – Integrating Europe’s Financial Sector Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB“Networked Business and Government – Something Real for the Lisbon Strategy”Finland’s EU Presidency ConferenceHelsinki, 23-24 October 2006   Title Ladies and gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure to address this conference and to return to this lovely part of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I recall what I could perhaps refer to as a typically Finnish experience that I had a couple of years ago on a working visit to Lapland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">After a long day of discussions, our Finnish hosts asked us to get from the meeting room to the dinner location on skis,  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Although two-thirds of the guests had never stood on skis, the Finnish hosts just presented us with enough pairs of cross-country skis for everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It was expected that we would simply give it a try, and we all did.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">This straight-forward, no-nonsense approach of the Finnish people is, I think, a valuable lesson for the rest of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Finland’s high-performing secondary education system and this country’s readiness to embrace new, innovative technologies further proves the point: a lot of pragmatism is necessary to build the future of Europe and, in particular, Europe’s financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Jean Monnet on European integration Pragmatism is certainly a virtue that Jean Monnet, one of the founders of modern Europe, did not lack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">As the quotations show, he had not only a lot of pragmatism, but also a clear vision of what an integrated Europe should be and of the possible hurdles along the way to achieving that vision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Unfortunately, some of these challenges in building a future for Europe are still valid today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Still, we have made a lot of progress in many areas, and I would like to highlight three areas of the financial sector in which European integration has proved to be successful and where work is still ongoing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">The first area is retail payments, the efficiency of which will be boosted by the introduction of the Single Euro Payments Area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The SEPA project will create a new pan-European competitive environment for retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">This is an area where Europe got off to a slow start, but is now making good progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">The second area is the provision of settlement services for securities transactions, an area in which the Eurosystem has recently decided to investigate options of becoming active as a provider, in order to ensure technical efficiency in the provision of central bank liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.35,0)">This decision was based on the observation that market-driven initiatives towards more integration in this area have had a mixed start and have made only slow progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The third area is the institutional integration of the supervisory practice and framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.14,0)">Here we observe that efforts are ongoing, but that the results are not yet sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">SEPA – Single Euro Payments Area Since 2002 euro area citizens have been able to pay from Lapland to Sicily with a common set of banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.3,0)">Yet a credit transfer from Frankfurt to Paris is still difficult and a cross-border direct debit is almost impossible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">The SEPA will mean competition, consolidation, cost reduction and choice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The SEPA will also bring about innovation beyond its core payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We refer to these developments under the title eSEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Value-added services and automated end-to-end processing will help to make many modern types of economic interaction more convenient, speedy and efficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Let me mention an example that has been very successful in Finland and other Nordic countries: namely, electronic invoicing and online payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">The major benefits of this for customers come from the fact that the invoice handling process is completely automated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.71,0)">There is no need for the payee to physically print and send invoices, or for the payer to transfer data into an accounting or banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Instead, the electronic information can be re-used directly by all parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The potential savings for users   of such e-invoicing services throughout the SEPA could easily add up to many billions of euro each year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">This example shows that the SEPA and eSEPA offer excellent opportunities for efficient retail payment and banking services in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">TARGET2-Securities In July 2006 the ECB announced that the Eurosystem was evaluating opportunities to provide settlement services for securities transactions This proposal is called TARGET2-Securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">If it materialises, it will bring about significant improvements to the way in which securities settlement in euro occurs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">TARGET is the biggest payment system in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It was built by the Eurosystem for the start of Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">TARGET2 is its second version – more efficient, less costly and more user-friendly – which is set to be launched in November 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Following on from this, TARGET2-Securities is a project which would make use of   the TARGET2 platform to settle the cash legs of securities transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">The purpose of TARGET2-Securities is to maximise safety and efficiency in the settlement of euro-denominated securities transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Safety is maximised by using the delivery-versus-payment mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Efficiency is maximised by settling cash and securities on the same IT platform, according to the so-called integrated model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Why are central banks becoming active in this area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">CSDs in the euro area are, to a large extent, local monopolies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">By merging their settlement function into a single system, the market will benefit from economies of scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">More than seven years after the launch of the euro, the market is still a long way from providing a coherent settlement platform for euro-denominated securities, despite the demands of users who want to benefit from economies of scale offered by the new currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Only one stakeholder   has progressed in this direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This settlement platform, which will open next year, will cover only part of central bank money settlement for euro-denominated securities, and will only cater for three national CSDs of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The aim of the TARGET2-Securities project is to provide a single platform for central bank money settlement, for all euro-denominated securities, and for all CSDs in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Already, potential users have signalled an interest in exploring the relationship to settlement systems in other countries as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Evaluating the cost and potential efficiency gains of the project is the subject of a feasibility study which has just been launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.58,0)">It is therefore far too early to be able to give you an estimate of the size of the fee reduction it may entail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">What is clear, however, is that this project will only make sense if it can be proven that it offers a substantial potential for reducing securities settlement fees; and I am not just talking about cross-border fees, but also domestic fees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Therefore, TARGET2-Securities may well prove to be another prominent example of the considerable economies of scale that financial integration can deliver in the field of market infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However, at this time, we must wait and see.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Institutional integration Institutional integration is a key for financial integration, as it sets a level playing-field for all market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Market participants need, and are indeed calling for, supervisory convergence, legal certainty and transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The Lamfalussy approach is the EU’s structure for developing and adopting financial services legislation at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It was adopted in 2001 for legislative measures on securities and was extended in 2005 to cover legislation in the fields of banking, insurance and pensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">To be completely successful, however, the Lamfalussy approach needs to receive active support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The work of the Level 3 Committees is expected to promote supervisory convergence and cooperation, thus providing an effective response to challenges arising from EU financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.42,0)">However, as noted in the First Interim Report of the Inter-institutional Monitoring Group, the Lamfalussy process is still a “learning-by-doing process”, and some issues may need further consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.29,0)">For instance, the report notes that there is “a potential danger in the fact that the results of the Level 3 Committees may be more “consensus” than “best practices” driven”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.19,0)">Unfortunately, it would appear that national considerations might be slowing down the legislative process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">However, existing tools could and will be further developed to foster supervisory convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">More specifically, on 5 May 2006, the ECOFIN Council endorsed a report by the Financial Services Committee   that made a number of recommendations to enhance the functioning of the Lamfalussy structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">These recommendations include the introduction of a mediation mechanism between supervisors, the delegation of tasks/responsibilities among supervisors for enhancing home-host cooperation, and the streamlining of information and data for cross-border business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The FSC will monitor the implementation of these recommendations and will report to the EU Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">It is even more important that the Lamfalussy approach is strong and efficient, now that it has been extended to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Everything should be done to explore as fully as possible the opportunities that the Lamfalussy structure offers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Next year’s review of the achievements of the Lamfalussy committee will allow us to take stock of the progress made and reflect on possible improvements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">However, the Lamfalussy approach alone is not sufficient for the adoption of new legislation fostering integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Integration will not be achieved without strong institutions and political will.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In Jean Monnet’s words: “Nothing is possible without humans, but nothing is lasting without institutions”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">As regards the need for political will, we need to accompany the current structure with a stronger political commitment and a specific plan   with clear dates and steps that set out how the process is to progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Regarding the need for strong institutions, depending on next year’s review, the Lamfalussy committees may need a stronger legal basis in order to make activities for achieving supervisory convergence more effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Maybe we will learn that convergence is not sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For the time being, however, the banking industry is calling for identical rules and practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">A stronger political commitment and   a stronger legal basis would allow the Lamfalussy committees to move away from consensual decision-making  , thus enabling experts to make the progress necessary for a more integrated financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">ECB activities The ECB has defined four areas of activity in the area of financial integration: to enhance knowledge and raise awareness and to measure the progress made; e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">via indicators of financial integration, speeches, conferences and research priorities; to act as a catalyst for private sector activities by facilitating collective action and assisting with possible coordination problems; e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">SEPA, standard market legal documentation  ; to provide advice on the legislative and regulatory framework for the European financial system; and to provide central banking services that foster European financial integration; e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">TARGET I and II, the new TARGET2-Securities project, single list of collateral, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Obstacles What are the three most critical obstacles in the examples discussed, and for financial integration in general?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.3,0)">A lack of political commitment: rather than an obstacle, the lack of political commitment is the missing bridge between European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">Strong political leadership is necessary to pave the way for a truly unified Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.22,0)">Vested interests: discussions and committees are too often plagued by vested and national interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">To build Europe, we need to behave as Europeans!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">An inertia in adopting new technology: Finland has benefited from an early focus on IT-investments and an open attitude towards the widespread use of modern IT.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Europe should learn from this positive, “Finnish” attitude of proposing and implementing new ideas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Measures Let me conclude by suggesting three specific measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">We must: intensify the integration of retail banking markets: SEPA; speed up the integration of key financial market infrastructures: TARGET2-Securities; and build the political commitment to fully exploit the potential of the Lamfalussy framework, to foster effective supervisory convergence and to actively monitor the results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">In a recent Wall Street Journal article, the Nobel Prize winner Edmund Phelps invited Europeans to become more pragmatic and to stir our dynamism, defined as “the fertility of the economy in coming up with innovative ideas believed to be technologically feasible and profitable – in short, the economy’s talent at commercially successful innovating”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">In his view, dynamism fosters innovation and, in his words, “a more innovative economy   also comes through the recruitment of new participants to the labour force”   and it makes “possible a reduction of the “natural” unemployment rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Thus, high dynamism tends to bring a pervasive prosperity to the economy on top of the productivity advances and the self-realisation going on”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In essence, these are the elements of the Lisbon agenda, which in March 2000 set the EU the goal of becoming “the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world” by 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In 2005 the European Commission presented a new approach to the Lisbon strategy focusing on growth and jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Phelps therefore would agree that Europe is taking a step in the right direction and that we are making progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.08,0)">Bridges However, I think we are taking too long to agree on and implement measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.15,0)">And we spend too long discussing compromises, instead of coming up with the best solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Europe has built bridges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Let’s use them!</span>
