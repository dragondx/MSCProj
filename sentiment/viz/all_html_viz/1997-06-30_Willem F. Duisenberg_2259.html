    <span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)"> Farewell to a Central banker Address by Dr. W. F. Duisenberg, President of De Nederlandsche Bank, on the occasion of Baron A. Lamfalussy's farewell as President of the European Monetary Institute, 30 June 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.99,0)">Dear Alexandre, Three and a half years ago, when you exchanged the premises of the Bank for International Settlements, an established international financial institution, for a couple of floors in a Frankfurter "Hochhaus", you took on a huge task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Your first mission was to set up the European Monetary Institute  , more or less starting from scratch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.51,0)">Moreover, you were faced with the responsibility of managing the preparations for Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.68,0)">It was not an easy decision to embark on a grand project like EMU, but putting the flesh on the bones of monetary union is even more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.18,0)">To be honest, at that time I would not like to have been in your shoes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">On both accounts you did a great job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The EMI is currently a thriving organisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.24,0)">The Institute started off with a handful of staff, more or less taken over from the Secretariat of the Committee of EC Central Bank Governors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">At present the EMI employs more than 200 people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.88,0)">Before the EMI was established, you had to take seemingly trivial decisions, like choosing suitable furniture for the meeting room of the EMI Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.88,0)">At an exhibition of furniture on the 36th floor, you immediately picked the smallest chair available, I was told.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Indeed, your modesty graces you, but looking at my size, and I'm sure I also speak on behalf of some other colleagues, I'm glad you eventually picked a larger one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">With respect to the preparations for EMU, both the EMI as well as the central banks are on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Indeed, as far as we are all concerned, EMU can start on 1 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Hence, you also made things easier for me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.52,0)">You have played the ball from the tee to the green, thus leaving me the "easy" task of putting it in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Alexandre, I don't think we are able to play a birdie or an eagle, let alone a hole-in-one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">But I promise you, we will play on par.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.71,0)">And I can tell you, I've done worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.84,0)">Things have not always been easy for you when chairing the meetings of the EMI Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">But being a central banker, heart and soul, you have always managed to find compromises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I vividly remember a few meetings of the EMI Council which you eventually managed to conclude successfully, although they started off as a babel of tongues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.21,0)">Also when ever the atmosphere around the table started to become a bit tense, you always emphasised the need for co-operation and co-ordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Indeed, in your opening statement to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy on the European Monetary Institute in November 1993, shortly before you officially took office as the first President of the EMI, you stressed the importance of enhanced monetary policy co-ordination among Member States as a means of steering as smoothly as possible towards Stage Three of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">You also stated that the EMI can and should play a constructive role in promoting this process of policy co-ordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">With the benefit of hindsight, everybody will agree that the EMI, under your management, has indeed contributed to a co-operative spirit among the EU national central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Indeed, as commentators often focus on the convergence of fiscal policies, which still leaves something to be desired, it is sometimes forgotten that the monetary conditions for the start of a monetary union between the Member States have never been so favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">In your foreword to the 1996 Annual Report of the EMI you rightly observe that EU foreign exchange markets are moderately calm and long-term interest rates are low, while differentials have narrowed appreciably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.36,0)">But Lamfalussy would not be Lamfalussy if he did not immediately add some reservations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The risks and challenges should not be underestimated, although you see grounds for cautious optimism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Indeed, you would not be a central banker without writing that counter-inflationary vigilance remains essential, although monetary policy has - in your eyes - justifiably been eased against the overall background of subdued inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">One of your greatest assets is that you have managed to combine this typical conservative and cautious nature of a central banker, always focused on substance, with your firm belief in European monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Having been a member of the Delors Committee for the Study of Economic and Monetary Union, you were at the cradle of European monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">You have never believed that a true single market is in the long run compatible with a quasi-floating exchange rate system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Over the past three and a half years, you have acted as a devoted missionary of EMU and European integration in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">In this capacity, you have managed to convert at least some incredulous European central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">And like any good missionary, you have also spread the message of EMU to the outside world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Over the last few years, you have held 67 official speeches and appeared in public on many other occasions, in total approximately 175 times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Indeed, you have beaten me there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.0,0)">A few days ago, when I took leave of the staff of De Nederlandsche Bank, I was reminded of having "only" held some 155 official speeches during my presidency of more than 15 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Dear Alexandre, good wine needs no bush, as we say in the Netherlands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">But some wines have such a delicious and well-balanced taste that they cannot remain unnoticed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The "Chateau Lamfalussy", mis en bouteille in 1929, is one of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">I am very grateful to you for leaving me a smoothly functioning and high quality institution, which the EMI currently is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">And I wish you and your wife all the best.</span>
