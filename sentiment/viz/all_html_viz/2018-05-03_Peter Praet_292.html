    <h3> Speaker: Peter Praet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)"> Economic and monetary policy in EMU: from unconventional times to sustainable and balanced growth Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the OECD Chief Economist Talks, Paris, 3 May 2018 Euro area real GDP has now been expanding for five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">The latest incoming information points towards some moderation in the pace of economic growth, in part reflecting a pull-back from the high growth rates observed at the end of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.29,0)">Temporary factors may also be at work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">We will also need to monitor whether, and if so, to what extent, these developments reflect a more durable softening in demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.31,0)">The latest economic data and survey results have generally surprised to the downside, suggesting some loss of momentum in economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.55,0)">This slowdown follows a very strong 2017, with the latest national accounts release showing that quarterly GDP growth in the fourth quarter of 2017 stood at 0.7% quarter on quarter, the same growth rate as in the two previous quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">A deceleration from the exceptionally high growth rates observed in the second half of 2017 had been expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.41,0)">However, the slowdown has come sooner than anticipated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.34,0)">The downward surprise in incoming information has been broad-based, as it can be observed in both hard data and survey indicators across most sectors and countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.17,0)">While the overall slowdown in recent economic indicators has been significant, transitory factors are likely to have played a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.83,0)">These exceptional factors include the cold weather conditions, influenza, the timing of Easter and school holidays, and industrial strikes in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">These developments may have been particularly relevant for the retail and construction sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.3,0)">In addition, concerns about trade protectionism may also have dampened business sentiment and expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.2,0)">Nevertheless, the recent slowdown could also be a sign that supply-side constraints are becoming increasingly binding, albeit only in some sectors and in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.99,0)">For instance, in the capital goods sector, capacity utilisation and backlogs/supply delivery times stand at all-time highs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.34,0)">Whereas in the construction sector, an increasing number of firms are indicating that a shortage of labour is limiting their production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">While these factors are likely to hold back economic activity in the near term, recent information remains consistent with a solid and broad-based expansion in domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Sentiment indicators remain in expansionary territory and are still well above long-term averages for most sectors and countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Moreover, the underlying momentum is still supported by favourable financing conditions, a robust labour market and steady income and profit growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.01,0)">Finally, signs that the past euro appreciation is dampening export growth remain limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.03,0)">Extra-euro area export growth slowed down in the first two months of the year, albeit from very high levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Moreover, over the same period, extra-euro area industrial new orders continued to expand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.5,0)">At the same time, the sharp decline in some sentiment indicators relating to the export sector is a source of concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">It lends support to the view that risks relating to global factors – including the threat of increased protectionism – have become more prominent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Inflation developments, however, remain subdued, and we have not yet met the Governing Council’s three criteria – convergence, confidence and resilience – for a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation, which is our stated condition for ceasing our net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Overall, an ample degree of monetary stimulus remains necessary for underlying inflation pressures to continue to build up and support headline inflation developments over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Hence, we must be patient, persistent and prudent in our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.8,0)">The financial crisis that erupted in 2008 posed unprecedented challenges for central banks across the world in the pursuit of their statutory mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">A main feature of central banks’ response to the crisis was the deployment of additional, and in some cases novel, monetary policy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">One of these instruments was what’s known as “quantitative easing”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">In the case of the euro area, this tool has not been used in isolation, but rather as part of a comprehensive package of complementary measures taken to combat the disinflationary forces that intensified in mid-2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Our monetary policy has effectively contributed to euro area macroeconomic adjustment through the staunch pursuit of our price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Today I will first look at the impact of our policies on financial conditions and macroeconomic variables over the past few years, to illustrate their beneficial effect on the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.08,0)">The correct measure of the efficacy of unconventional monetary policy measures has been the subject of some debate in recent times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.71,0)">In particular, the durability of the imprint that such unconventional policies have left on financial conditions has been called into question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Overall, diverse empirical approaches to quantifying the impact of our package of measures support the same conclusion: the actions we took have had a strong and lasting effect on market conditions, and more importantly, achieved a potent pattern of propagation to the broad economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">We cannot yet declare “mission accomplished” on the inflation front, but we have made substantial progress on the path towards a sustained adjustment in inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.78,0)">Monetary policy, however, is only one side of the story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Price stability is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for sustained and balanced growth in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The run-up to the crisis proved that macroeconomic imbalances can grow amid price stability  , highlighting the need to keep economic policy high on Europe’s agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In the second part of my talk I will therefore concentrate on economic policies and their essential role in ensuring a smooth functioning of Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I will look back at the experience of the euro area since 1999 and illustrate the emergence of macroeconomic imbalances by focusing on three countries: Spain, Germany and France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">The crisis acted as a litmus test for Europe’s institutional framework, revealing the need for a number of institutional reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Lessons have been learned and significant progress towards strengthening EMU has been achieved, including elevating the responsibility of banking supervision from the national to the European level, the creation of the European Stability Mechanism as a permanent crisis management institution, and improvements in the EU surveillance framework for economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Progress towards completing the banking union and the capital markets union has rightly emerged as one of the immediate priorities in strengthening EMU,  not least as such progress is seen as crucial in supporting macroeconomic adjustment in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Today it is fair to say that the euro area has lived up to the challenges posed by the existential crisis and euro area countries have displayed a strong commitment to EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.03,0)">Macroeconomic adjustment in EMU has made significant progress, with countries implementing significant growth-enhancing reforms and correcting external imbalances, but this process has been difficult and is not yet complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Countries most affected by the crisis were confronted with significant hardship, even though financial support provided by the EU and its Member States to countries facing acute financing difficulties prevented catastrophic outcomes, and cushioned some of its impact by providing time for economic adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Looking forward, in order to sustain a high level of social welfare in the long term, euro area countries need to ensure that macroeconomic adjustment occurs smoothly and to prevent the build-up of durable imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.22,0)">The impact of the ECB’s non-standard measures By mid-2014, the euro area economy was facing disinflationary pressures that risked spiralling into outright deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.38,0)">With the deposit facility rate held at zero since July 2012, our ability to provide the necessary degree of monetary stimulus using conventional policy measures was very limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Under these conditions, the focus of providing monetary accommodation shifted from an approach based on adjusting key ECB interest rates to one that more directly affects the whole constellation of interest rates across the yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Specifically, the instruments we have employed since June 2014 are negative interest rates on the deposit facility; a reinforced form of forward guidance on the evolution of key interest rates in the future; targeted longer-term refinancing operations  ; and the asset purchase programme  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">With policy rates at exceptionally low levels, the APP soon became the primary instrument for calibrating the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">How effective have our asset purchases been in helping the ECB to accomplish its statutory objective in the medium term?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.42,0)">Answering this question is inherently difficult because of the complex interaction of our APP with other policy instruments as well as our evolutionary communication about the purchase programme, through which we signalled our intention to start buying bonds and, later, to recalibrate the size and duration of our bond-buying programme in advance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Hence, in assessing the impact of the APP, we must also take into account the other policy tools used since mid-2014, because the instruments were designed to be complementary and mutually reinforcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The four instruments that have determined the stance of our monetary policy since mid-2014 have been designed to reap the full benefits of their complementarities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Two examples highlight the role played by complementarities in policy design.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">First, the negative interest rate policy has supported the portfolio rebalancing channel of our APP by encouraging banks to lend to the broad economy instead of hoarding liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Second, the APP has supported rate forward guidance through the signalling channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Generally, asset purchases are thought to provide a strong signal that policy rates will remain low for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">For the ECB, this effect is reinforced by the sequencing of our instruments through which we have indicated that our policy rates will likely remain at their current levels “well past the horizon of our net asset purchases”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Our overall assessment – and that of a growing body of empirical literature – is that non-standard measures have had a sizeable and lasting impact on broad financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">These improvements are not limited to the asset classes included in our APP, but have spilled over to other market segments  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">In addition, easier market funding conditions have been passed through to bank lending rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Importantly, these findings are based on a range of econometric techniques and are therefore robust to the limitations associated with any individual methodology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">But we also use model counterfactuals to complement the impact metrics that we derive from event studies, and to test whether or not the impact of our announcements endures beyond the very short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">In this context, dynamic term structure models of the type that have become standard in contemporary fixed income finance, augmented with a factor capturing central bank bond holdings, have consistently confirmed the inference we draw from event studies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">They indicate that our purchases have had a sizeable and durable influence on long-term yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.7,0)">At present, the current and anticipated size of our APP portfolio – which has been increased in various recalibration steps and is expected to be maintained “for an extended period of time” after the end of net asset purchases – is still putting downward pressure on euro area long-term yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.69,0)">The longer the expected period of reinvestment, the stronger the downward pressure on yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.79,0)">If one takes current surveys of market participants’ views about the time over which the ECB is anticipated to roll over its APP securities, and assumes the modal expectation of a two-year period, one finds that the downward pressure that APP asset holdings – current and expected – are exerting on longer-term interest rates is in the order of 100 basis points  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.24,0)">Downward pressure on yields is expected to be very persistent and to decline only gradually, but consistently, as we move forward in time, because of what is referred to as the “portfolio ageing” effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.32,0)">The effects of our purchases of long-dated assets on market yields are principally due to the fact that we withdraw duration from private hands, and as the securities we hold in our portfolio draw closer to maturity and “lose duration” progressively, the overall amount of duration contained in our portfolio has a tendency to melt away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">And this gradual loss of duration will reduce downward pressure on yields  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">There has been a strong pass-through of our non-standard measures to financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.39,0)">For example, model-based counterfactual simulations attribute more than half of the 126 basis point decline in lending rates to non-financial corporations since June 2014 directly to our non-standard measures  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The APP has supported the provision of loans to customers at better terms and conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Banks themselves – when asked to assess the effects of our measures on their intermediation business – have reported that the APP has positively impacted their market financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.44,0)">As a consequence of this generalised easing in financing conditions, our measures have had substantial macroeconomic effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.22,0)">Taking into account all of the monetary policy measures taken between mid-2014 and October 2017 and the March 2018 ECB staff macroeconomic projections, staff have estimated that the overall impact on both growth and inflation in the euro area is around 1.9 percentage points in cumulative terms for the period between 2016 and 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Importantly, our measures have also been successful in reducing the fragmentation of the euro area financial system stemming from the sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">They have ensured very favourable borrowing conditions in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">To sum up, the available evidence strongly supports the conclusion that the APP – together with our other non-standard measures – has been effective and probably decisive in warding off troublesome macroeconomic outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">It has certainly propelled the economic recovery into a robust and broad-based expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">And it has very likely prevented the disinflationary pressures of 2014 from spiralling into a self-reinforcing deflationary vortex  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">We cannot yet declare “mission accomplished” on the inflation front, but we have made substantial progress on the path towards a sustained adjustment in inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.2,0)">The emergence of macroeconomic imbalances Monetary policy has been very successful in supporting domestic demand and inflation, but it cannot address the structural problems that were at the root of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Monetary policy was able to buy time to facilitate the adjustment of macroeconomic imbalances and to address the deficiencies in the euro area’s institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.46,0)">The crisis has demonstrated how persistent losses in competitiveness can translate into macroeconomic imbalances, eventually leading to a painful adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Spain’s experience during the crisis is instructive in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">With the start of Monetary Union, the disappearance of exchange rate risk premia and the unprecedented fall in interest rates facilitated capital inflows and encouraged risk-taking behaviour, resulting in a rapid rise in private debt and a property boom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.97,0)">The expectation of higher levels of income led to excessive consumption and investment relative to the supply capacity of the Spanish economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.18,0)">This continuous demand pressure generated a positive inflation differential vis-à-vis the rest of the euro area, leading to a strong appreciation of the real exchange rate and an erosion of price competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.65,0)">When the crisis hit, the subsequent adjustment was severe – with unemployment at levels above 25%, a rapid erosion of the fiscal position and a number of bank failures – leading to a significant contraction in both domestic demand and real GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Similar developments were observed in other current account deficit countries, such as Portugal, Ireland and Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.42,0)">For countries with large current account deficits, the adjustment was painful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.19,0)">The correction of euro area macroeconomic imbalances was particularly asymmetric, with the bulk of the adjustment falling on current account deficit countries through a strong contraction in domestic demand, with limited support from a higher demand contribution from current account surplus countries, despite those countries being less affected by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Growth in the surplus countries, including Germany, became even more export-oriented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.39,0)">An important lesson from the crisis was that the euro area had insufficient tools at its disposal to, on the one hand, prevent the build-up of unsustainable asset price booms and, on the other hand, mitigate their impact if they occured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">The answer to such problems lies, ex ante, in better macroprudential and microprudential policies and better regulation of the financial system and, ex post, in better resolution institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Strengthening Europe’s financial framework, including the establishment of the banking union, is the right way to address this source of macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">The banking union will make the adjustment process less asymmetrical between creditors and debtors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is of the utmost importance to complete the banking union without delay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.51,0)">Macroeconomic imbalances in the euro area can also be attributed to factors other than the financial cycle, such as durably diverging competitiveness positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The importance of such economic factors already featured prominently in the theory of optimal currency areas, as pioneered by Mundell in 1961.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.25,0)">Competitiveness imbalances are one of the most visible symptoms of insufficient macroeconomic adjustment mechanisms in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Developments in Germany and France – two countries which together represent nearly half of euro area GDP, and have seen broadly similar movements in GDP and prices   since the start of Monetary Union – are instructive in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.77,0)">Germany, at the start of Monetary Union, was considered the “sick man of Europe”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">At the time, the country was still recovering from the high costs associated with its reunification, and its conversion rate was widely considered to be overvalued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The national policy response was a prolonged period of union-backed wage moderation  together with a significant labour market overhaul which aimed, among other things, to improve job search efficiency and employment flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.44,0)">The result was striking: from 1999 to 2008, nominal unit labour costs were virtually unchanged for the economy as a whole   and were thus growing significantly below the level that the so-called “golden wage rule” would suggest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.19,0)">This resulted in a strong export performance, but weak domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The economic policies Germany pursued before the crisis largely explain why it emerged relatively unscathed from the Great Recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Exports recovered swiftly and currently stand at an all-time high, roughly equalling half of the country’s GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Exports to countries outside the euro area recovered particularly strongly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.29,0)">Meanwhile, the contribution of domestic demand to GDP continued on its downward path, in part on account of subdued wage growth and a tight fiscal policy  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">In contrast to Germany, France entered Monetary Union in much better shape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.91,0)">Growth in the initial years was strong and unemployment declined by more than a fourth within five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.8,0)">Wage increases remained moderate, even below euro area averages, and unit labour costs moved according to the golden wage rule, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.84,0)">at an average annual rate below, but close to, 2%  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">However, with German unit labour costs remaining virtually unchanged over the period, a significant competitiveness gap built up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.65,0)">This was further aggravated by the crisis, during which French wages remained relatively sticky, in spite of the sharp fall in productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.04,0)">The consequences were especially detrimental for the French export sector, which suffered significant losses in market share  , despite the substantial squeeze in profit margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">At the same time, the contribution of domestic demand to growth became increasingly important, supported by fiscal policy   and sticky wage developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.43,0)">As a result, there is now a striking divergence between France and Germany on a number of macroeconomic dimensions: in Germany, the domestic demand-to-GDP ratio is now among the lowest across advanced economies, whereas in France, it is among the highest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.88,0)">The opposite is true for exports  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">The recent economic policy orientations and plans set out by the German and French authorities are steps in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">France has already, in recent years, made important progress in addressing these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">For example, the European Commission considers that the country has made at least some progress in addressing 72% of its country-specific recommendations since 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Substantial progress has been achieved in decreasing the cost of labour and reforming labour laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">There has also been significant progress in implementing reform recommendations related to the long-term sustainability of public finances, skills and lifelong learning, and the business environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">These reforms, together with those that are still planned, could yield sizeable growth benefits and improve competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">These recent developments give reason to hope that cross-country interdependencies within Monetary Union will be better internalised in national decision-making processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Some lessons for the future Our monetary policy measures are bearing fruit, and the growth outlook confirms our confidence that inflation will converge towards our aim of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.81,0)">Monetary policy alone cannot prevent the build-up of divergences in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.08,0)">The nature of EMU makes macroeconomic adjustment in the euro area more complex than in a federal state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Monetary policy is a competence assigned at EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The European Central Bank’s price stability objective is enshrined in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">By contrast, economic policy remains in the remit of Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is, however, a Treaty obligation for Member States to regard their economic policies as a matter of common concern and to coordinate them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.81,0)">Our framework for the coordination of economic policies was clearly not effective in preventing the emergence of lasting imbalances in the euro area in the run-up to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.19,0)">Protracted losses in competitiveness eventually led to unsustainable external positions and even “sudden stops” in the financing of external deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.62,0)">This is not new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.76,0)">Unfortunately, we can point to several episodes in history when governments and social partners failed to internalise external constraints, resulting in widening imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.96,0)">This typically led to currency crises and exchange rate realignments in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.19,0)">Monetary instability prevented Europeans from reaping the full benefit of the internal market and limited Europe’s growth potential and its role as a global economic actor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In our institutional framework for economic policies, it is primarily up to the Member States to respond to the economic challenges they are faced with, thereby ensuring that their economic structures are compatible with participation in Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">To reap the full benefit of Monetary Union, it is essential to ensure that national economic policies lead to sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Preventing the emergence of economic imbalances and creating the conditions for a thriving social market economy is not only a matter of national interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.5,0)">It is also a matter of common concern, as a crisis in one country has repercussions for all members of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Effective surveillance is indispensable at both EU and national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Looking ahead, we need to further enhance the coordination of national economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">National economic policies, the effects of which can propagate through the EU, should genuinely be considered a matter of common concern by national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">At the European level, a key role can be played by the European Semester process for the coordination of economic policies – including the macroeconomic imbalance procedure – which was introduced by the EU in 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">However, it should be used to its full potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Moreover, for reform recommendations to be implemented at the national level and not be considered as illegitimate external constraints, it will thus be key going forward for national debates and decision-making processes to more fully internalise what it means to be part of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">If outside recommendations are perceived as being politically too costly, then we need to find solutions that promote national “ownership” of reform efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Monetary policy and sound economic policies must be complemented with sound financial sector policies to ensure sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.28,0)">The recent crisis has shown that the quality of financial integration matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.48,0)">Risk sharing through the financial system can go into reverse, and banks can amplify and propagate rather than mitigate economic disturbances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.87,0)">This was a painful but well-learned lesson for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It is the reason that the banking union was established and the capital markets union was launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Substantial progress has already been made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The EU moved in less than five years from decentralised banking supervision and resolution to the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism, based on the single rulebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">This is part of an overarching effort to create a sound institutional framework for financial integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">However, the work needs to be completed so that we can reap the full benefits of the banking union and the capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.95,0)">An incomplete banking union may not be able to shield the euro area from financial re-fragmentation in a renewed crisis situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.93,0)">Likewise, an incomplete capital markets union may impair the capacity of the financial system to share risks across Member States through private channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The missing elements of the banking union, namely the establishment of a European deposit insurance scheme and a backstop to the Single Resolution Fund, should be put in place without delay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This should go hand in hand with further progress in areas of key relevance for the banking union, including progress towards harmonising and improving national insolvency frameworks, reducing non-performing loans and strengthening the single rulebook.</span><span
