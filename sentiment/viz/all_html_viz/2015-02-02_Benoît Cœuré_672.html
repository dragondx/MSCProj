    <span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)"> Lamfalussy was right: independence and interdependence in a monetary union Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at Lamfalussy Lecture Conference organised by Magyar Nemzeti Bank in Budapest,2 February 2015 *** Summary Decision-makers in different policy areas act independently and are at the same time interdependent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Managing interdependence requires strong framework: “monetary dominance” is the framework in the euro area in which the central bank acts in independence and fiscal policies are constrained in the SGP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.81,0)">The crisis in Europe has shown that policy interactions can be more subtle and involve also financial and structural policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Monetary policy becomes more effective in impacting the real economy if other policies act in support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.73,0)">If not, it has less impact and expansionary policy has to last longer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.79,0)">An example for interdependence between monetary and financial policies   is if supervisors show too much forbearance to undercapitalized banks, central bank funding may end up being used to fill the gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.64,0)">Fiscal policies can also become overburdened if they need to smoothen the economic cycle and at the same time stabilize the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Banking union has been there one answer to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">European supervision helps align the governance of the financial sector with the aims of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.83,0)">And the resolution leg creates rules that limit the link between fiscal policies and the banking sector; bail-in replaces bail-out by governments and taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The interaction between structural reforms and fiscal policies is clear: if product and labour markets are resilient and flexible, there is less need for fiscal intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.69,0)">Constantly refining fiscal rules while leaving structural policies at the national level makes little sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">If fiscal policies are to be freed from structural dominance, strong framework for both is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Today structural reforms are their own reward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Tomorrow sovereignty over structural reforms should be shared between countries, allowing for symmetric risk sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">*** Ladies and gentlemen, Let me begin by reiterating my appreciation for receiving the award in honour of Alexandre Lamfalussy, and my pleasure to be here in Budapest today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">What I want to talk about this morning is a theme in which Lamfalussy himself took great interest, which is the interaction between policies in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In fact, in the Delors Committee, where he was an independent expert, Lamfalussy was one of the foremost proponents of the view that policy interactions in a monetary union had to be governed by a proper framework, and not just left up to ad hoc coordination and market discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">My main argument today is that Lamfalussy was right – and in more ways than even recognised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">A monetary union creates complex interactions which have to be governed by a strong and comprehensive framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.84,0)">Many of these interactions we have only really understood thanks to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.58,0)">And in crucial areas, such as structural policies, we have still not adequately responded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.53,0)">Independence and interdependence between policies In any polity there is always a tension between economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">On the one hand, decision-makers in different policy areas act independently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.61,0)">But on the other, they inevitably have to take into account what the others are doing – they are interdependent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.92,0)">This is an inherent struggle which, if left to itself, can produce outcomes that no party really wants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">For example, central bank independence is a necessary condition for monetary policy to focus on its core price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is an essential feature of Europe's constitutional order and puts the onus on governments not to intervene in the policy-making, management and budget of central banks, including in those countries which have not yet adopted the euro, such as here, in Hungary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But independence is not a sufficient condition to ensure that monetary policy calls the shots, as we know from literature on monetary and fiscal dominance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.35,0)">Essentially what this literature finds is that if fiscal policy is not constrained by a rule which ensures the sustainability of debt, the central bank is ultimately forced into inflationary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.61,0)">At the same time, inflation can make output stabilisation through fiscal policy less effective, as workers’ expectations adapt and prices rise faster than incomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.74,0)">So all parties lose out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The conclusion is that managing interdependence requires a strong framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Policymakers must decide which aims they want to prioritise and construct a set of rules which promotes that and sets incentives right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">In the euro area, we consciously built our framework around “monetary dominance” – ensuring that the central bank could pursue price stability unconstrained by fiscal considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We did this by giving full independence to the central bank, while constraining fiscal policies through the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, and now of the Fiscal Compact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.01,0)">One can debate the details of this framework, but on its own terms it succeeded: in no cases have fiscal policies caused the central bank to lose its price stability focus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Take the example of the ECB’s recent decision to extend its asset purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This has been taken in full independence to achieve our medium-term price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And in our decision, we have taken into account the specificities of the euro area, meaning that we operate in an environment of decentralised national fiscal authorities, and the ECB has no mandate to engage in large scale pooling of fiscal risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But we have also learned from the crisis that policy interdependence has different dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.08,0)">There are more subtle interactions between policies than our framework initially acknowledged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And these involve not just monetary and fiscal policies but financial and structural policies as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.08,0)">What is at issue is not the classic idea about one policy causing another to lose focus on its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.39,0)">It is ex post coordination failure, where some policies miss their mandate, causing others to do more precisely to be faithful to their own – what one might call “weak dominance”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.71,0)">For example, if financial supervisors do not encourage a fast and efficient clean-up of bank balance sheets, central banks’ interest rate cuts are less likely to be passed on to entrepreneurs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And this is exactly what we saw in the euro area until the Single Supervisory Mechanism was decided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">And if at the same time governments do not make it easier to open a new business, those entrepreneurs are less likely to ask for a loan and take advantage of those low financing costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And this is also what we have seen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In short, monetary policy becomes more effective in impacting the real economy if other policies act in a supportive way; and if they do not, it has less impact and expansionary policy has to last longer to fulfill the mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.12,0)">So, “weak dominance” is essentially about whether policies complement or compensate for each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">And what determines this is the framework – whether it is strong enough to ensure the right policies dominate, and whether comprehensive enough to achieve that along all the relevant dimensions of policy interaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">While such a framework is important in any country, it is even more important in a multi-country union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.94,0)">In a single country coordination and policy adjustments involve a single treasury and economics ministry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">But in a monetary union there are multiple different policymakers and policies to align.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">A strong framework that constrains discretion is therefore indispensable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Fiscal dominance Though there is much that can be said about how fiscal dominance in this context, I have discussed this elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.72,0)">The risk of "weak" fiscal dominance was actually recognised by Lamfalussy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.63,0)">He noted that the lack of an appropriate aggregate fiscal stance for the euro area could lead to monetary policy having to bear too much of the adjustment burden: “The combination of a small Community budget with large ….</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.61,0)">national budgets leads to the conclusion that, in the absence of fiscal coordination, the global fiscal policy of the EMU would be the accidental outcome of decisions taken by Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">... As a result, the only global macroeconomic tool available within the EMU would be the common monetary policy implemented by the European central banking system."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">There is much to learn from this comment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">But in the remainder of my remarks I would like to focus on two other areas where we learned important lessons from the crisis for our future framework: financial policies and structural policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.46,0)">Financial dominance For financial policies – that is, the governance of the banking sector – we saw clearly during the crisis how a weak framework can allow weak forms of dominance to take hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.35,0)">Both monetary and fiscal policies can have their choices constrained by so-called “financial dominance”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.14,0)">For monetary policy, the problem stems mostly from inadequate supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.61,0)">At the micro level, if supervisors show too much forbearance to undercapitalised banks, they can end up effectively shifting the burden onto monetary policy – as when those banks lose access to market funding, or have to pay higher risk premia, they turn to central bank funding to fill the gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.33,0)">Monetary policy has limited discretion here as it cannot independently judge the solvency of its counterparties – and remember, we have 2194.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.39,0)">At the macro level, if supervisory policies allow banks to grow too rapidly, and then deleverage too slowly, it can also push the central bank into doing more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Since monetary transmission becomes impaired, the monetary ‘impulse’ has to be strengthened compensate for the diminished ‘outpulse’ coming out of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Many of our non-standard measures during the crisis, such as our Long-Term Refinancing Operations  , have essentially performed this function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.85,0)">Moreover, weak micro-supervision and the resulting high level of non-performing loans can also trigger conflicts with other policy areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.42,0)">For example, when bad banks or asset management companies are set up to deal with legacy asset problems, as happened for example in Slovenia and Spain, it is essential that the line between the duties of fiscal and monetary authorities is not blurred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Central banking is about providing liquidity for solvent institutions, not about providing capital for insolvent ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Thus, the capitalisation of asset management companies in any country should preferably be shouldered by the private sector, and if this is not possible, by the fiscal authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.28,0)">We have also seen in the euro area, however, that fiscal policies can face their own dominance problem related to financial policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.85,0)">This stems less from supervision than from inadequate resolution frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.26,0)">The key issue is that if national fiscal policies are expected both to stabilise the business cycle and to bail-out the banking sector, incurred and contingent liabilities become unsustainable in a banking crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In the euro area the total commitment to bank rescue packages amounted to 26% of 2008 GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.87,0)">Thus, fiscal policy can quickly become overburdened as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.51,0)">And here again, a too weak financial framework can trigger conflicts in other areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.59,0)">If fiscal policy is forced to contract when it is needed to smooth the cycle, then obviously this will reduce aggregate demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And insofar as this affects price stability, it has to be compensated for by the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Monetary policy has the duty to respond to fulfil its mandate – as the ECB is doing today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.66,0)">The lesson is that dominance is always a multidimensional problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">There is a triangle of monetary, fiscal and financial policies that requires a strong coordination framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">And the Banking Union has gone a long way to providing this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">To begin with, the move to European supervision helps align the governance of the financial sector with the aims of monetary policy – or put differently, it reasserts monetary dominance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The European supervisor has stronger incentives to uncover weak banks, which helps reduce the risk of financing so-called “zombie banks”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">And it is also able to use macroprudential policies to temper swings in the leverage cycle – for example through the release of countercyclical capital buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">This means that monetary policy transmission should be more immune from disruption, and interest policy should not be overburdened over the cycle with the objective to avoid and then eliminate asset price bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">At the same time, the resolution leg of Banking Union – the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Single Resolution Mechanism – creates a set of rules that will in principle provide separation between fiscal policies and the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Bail-in of private creditors will replace bail-out by governments and taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">And this will in turn mean that the public sector has lower contingent liabilities towards banks, creating more space for fiscal policies to act counter-cyclically alongside monetary policy in a downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.41,0)">Structural dominance Nevertheless, the loss of fiscal space that many countries have experienced during the crisis – and the knock-on effects for monetary policy – cannot solely be explained by bank bailouts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">As has long been recognised, going back to the literature on optimal currency areas  , there is also an important interaction in a monetary union between fiscal and structural policies at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">If an economy has resilient product and labour markets and adjusts more quickly to shocks, there is less need for expansionary fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.02,0)">But if inefficiencies are high and the economy adjusts more slowly, fiscal policies need to be more expansionary, and for longer, and this can in turn generate spillovers on other participating economies and on the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.45,0)">To give an example of this interaction, Ireland and Spain were two countries that experienced relatively similar shocks emanating from the financial and construction sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.09,0)">Both saw their primary deficits deteriorate by around 13pp of GDP between 2007 and 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.6,0)">However, by 2012 Ireland had reduced that deficit by more than 7pp of GDP, whereas in Spain the primary deficit was less than 2pp lower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">This certainly reflected stronger consolidation efforts in Ireland as part of its adjustment programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">But it also reflected the faster adjustment in prices and wages in the Irish economy, which helped unemployment to begin stabilising in late 2010, while in Spain it rose until early 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Of course many other factors were at play as well, but the point is that economic flexibility matters for the size and duration of deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.03,0)">And what this implies is that, if structural reforms do not happen, there can be a form of “structural dominance” over fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.45,0)">When a shock hits fiscal policies are forced to do all the heavy lifting to stabilise the economy and, over time, fiscal space becomes progressively exhausted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.74,0)">Indeed, this is one explanation for why the Stability and Growth Pact   rules have not been as effective as we hoped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">There is a correlation between the ease with which countries comply with the rules and their progress on structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.11,0)">Effectively, through lack of reforms some countries have put themselves in a position of excessive deficit dependence, which then makes the difficulty and costs of meeting their obligations higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.71,0)">The conclusion, therefore, is that constantly tinkering with our common fiscal rules while leaving governance of structural policies entirely at the national level makes little sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">If fiscal policies are to be freed from structural dominance, then we need an equally strong framework in both domains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">And it is fair to say in the EU context that the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure   has less teeth and has not benefited from the same level of ownership and political attention as the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">We could also envisage some complementarities between the two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">For example, it does make sense to take into account structural reforms when assessing compliance with the SGP, as the Commission now intends to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This is because structural reforms not only reduce the amount of fiscal space needed for effective stabilisation, but they also increase future fiscal space via higher potential output and hence higher government revenues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.94,0)">However, not all structural reforms are associated with fiscal costs, such as notably product market reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">And some, like some social security reforms, may actually imply short-term fiscal gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">But most importantly, because we do not yet have a credible framework, we should only take into account reforms once they are implemented, not when they are simply announced – and seek an independent assessment of their cost and GDP impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">These are all reasons for countries to press ahead with building a stronger framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But above all, in the current situation, structural reforms are their own reward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">You may recall the not-so-old debate about introducing reform contracts with financial incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Well, those incentives are already there!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">I have discussed elsewhere how structural reforms make monetary policy more effective in a given country and how they help regain fiscal space.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">Countries that reform now thus effectively receive, in return, a more expansionary monetary policy and a less contractionary fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In fact, our recent decision to expand our asset purchases, together with energy prices and an exchange rate more favourable to growth, have opened a unique window of opportunity for euro area governments to act together, remove structural obstacles to growth, and pull our economy out of the low growth, low confidence trap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.73,0)">In saying this, I am of course aware that structural reforms can have mixed effects on growth and inflation, and in certain situations can impact negatively on both in the short-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.0,0)">But empirical evidence is mixed   and the balance of effects depends crucially on designing reform packages well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">And indeed, many of the reforms that are on the table today – such as improving the business environment – have little disinflationary effects but can provide a strong boost to investment demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Looking further ahead, stronger governance of structural reforms is also in the enlightened self-interest of all countries that want to see a deepening of our monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.9,0)">It is now fairly clear that, in the long-term, a Union based on no risk-sharing will be vulnerable economically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.21,0)">Yet we also know that permanent transfers between countries cannot work politically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The only way to resolve this paradox is if, behind the “veil of ignorance”, risk-sharing is symmetric between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">This is only possible if all countries share sovereignty over structural reforms so that they have equivalent growth prospects and shock absorption capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">And this will in turn be made even easier if deeper cross-border market integration, starting with an effective Capital Markets Union, reduces in the first place the need to share risk through public balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Conclusion This brings me to my conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Alexandre Lamfalussy had great faith in the power of the EU institutional framework to enforce policy coordination and deliver a socially optimal outcome for the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.48,0)">This, the crisis has shown, was overly optimistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">It is clear that the euro area needs stronger rules to regulate the many different forms of policy dominance that emerge due to interdependence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">That said, if over time those rules lead to more convergence, and more convergence leads to more common institutions with more common powers, then it may be that we need less rules down the road.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This is not because complexity is less, but because a single central bank, a single treasury and a single economy ministry can manage it more effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In other words, rules are a means to an end, which is a monetary union that creates jobs and growth in an environment of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And until we decisively deepen our monetary union, they are the only way to achieve it.</span><span style="background-color:
