    <h1> A commitment to the recovery  </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Rome Investment Forum 2020 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Fabio Panetta </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)"> A commitment to the recovery Speech by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Rome Investment Forum 2020 Rome, 14 December 2020 2020 has been a year like no other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.2,0)">We have faced an economic contraction without precedent in peacetime: in the first half of this year output in the euro area declined by more than 15%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">But we have also seen a collective response that has no precedent in the history of our monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">That response has protected our economy from a potentially catastrophic depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">And now, with positive news on vaccines, we are finally able to glimpse the light at the end of the tunnel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">But we still need to pass through the tunnel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.81,0)">2021 will likely be a “pandemic year”, characterised by high uncertainty and widespread vulnerabilities among firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">How the European economy emerges from the crisis will depend on how we manage this transition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">So what I would like to argue today is that policymakers must commit to continue providing certainty to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The end of the pandemic is now in sight, and we need to extend policy support in order to underpin the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But expansionary policies must not be wasted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Only by taking the opportunity to invest in Europe’s recovery can we re-emerge on the other side with a more dynamic economy and a more sustainable debt burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.25,0)">A common shock, a common response The coronavirus   is a common shock that has had asymmetric effects , hurting some sectors and economies much more than others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">But what has defined this crisis – and set it apart from previous ones – is the policy response at the European level and the recognition that a common shock requires a common response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">From the outset, monetary and fiscal policies have reinforced each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The ECB has taken forceful monetary policy measures to stabilise markets and prevent a tightening of financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">And fiscal policy has empowered monetary policy by offsetting lost private sector income and enabling banks to support the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">European policies – the ECB’s monetary policy and the joint EU fiscal support – have generated a European dividend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">This was a step change in European crisis management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">As a result, the euro area economy was able to stage a strong rebound over the summer, as containment measures were lifted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.92,0)">However, the recovery has been temporarily suspended in recent months due to the resurgence of the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.93,0)">Eurosystem staff now project that the euro area economy will contract by more than 2% in the fourth quarter of this year, with GDP falling by 7.3% overall in 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.19,0)">Growth next year will be 3.9%, 1.1 percentage points lower than expected in September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Inflation will remain subdued for a protracted period: it is currently negative and is projected to rise to just 1.1% in 2022 and 1.4% in 2023; excluding its more volatile components, it is expected to increase to only 1.2% in 2023.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.45,0)">This inflation weakness reflects the significant demand gap that the economy will be facing in the next two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">And – of relevance to today’s forum – this has implications for business investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.64,0)">With high uncertainty compounding weak demand and financial vulnerability , it is not surprising that businesses today are reluctant to make irreversible decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">According to a recent survey by the European Investment Bank, more than 80% of companies consider uncertainty the main barrier to investment – and this figure rises to 96% in Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.99,0)">It is therefore little wonder that, at the end of the third quarter, total investment in the euro area was about 10% below its pre-pandemic level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.42,0)">Consumption and GDP were down 4.6% and 4.3%, respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.55,0)">We cannot provide clarity about when the vaccine will be widely available or even how people will respond when that day comes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">But we can guarantee our commitment to support the recovery: the stabilisation effort should therefore continue until the economy is on a solid, durable recovery path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.39,0)">Indeed, if firms are to invest more today, they must be confident that their financing costs will not rise prematurely and leave them with an unaffordable debt burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">For monetary policy, this means providing certainty about financing conditions well into the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.74,0)">Last week, the ECB’s Governing Council did just that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The ECB’s contribution: preserving favourable financing conditions Since the very beginning of this crisis, the ECB has taken forceful measures to ensure that all sectors can benefit from favourable financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">In March we launched the pandemic emergency purchase programme  , under which we had purchased €700 billion of private and public sector bonds by the end of November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.91,0)">Nearly all euro area sovereigns are now borrowing at negative rates up to five-year maturities, while corporate bond spreads have narrowed significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Our purchases were complemented by a further easing of our targeted longer-term refinancing operations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Over the past six months, more than €1.3 trillion has been allotted to banks at very favourable rates on the condition that they continue providing financial support to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">TLTROs are a powerful form of support to small and medium-sized enterprises, which mainly rely on bank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Our measures are ensuring that households, firms and governments can benefit from very accommodative financing conditions throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">And in order to provide the certainty that the economy needs, the ECB is committed to preserving favourable financing conditions well into the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">To this end, last week we decided to strengthen our monetary policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">We increased the envelope of the PEPP by €500 billion, to a total of €1.85 trillion, and extended the horizon for the net purchases until at least March 2022.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">This large envelope gives us considerable firepower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">It allows us to respond flexibly at any time and with the necessary force to resist a premature tightening of financing conditions that could jeopardise the return of inflation in a sustained way to our aim of 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">We have also extended the most favourable conditions on our TLTROs until June 2022 and broadened their size, in terms of maximum borrowing allowance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">This will help calm fears of a tightening of financing conditions in the coming months – fears which we saw emerging in our latest survey on the access to finance of small and medium-sized enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The PEPP envelope can be further expanded and extended, if warranted by the inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">And we stand ready to adjust all our instruments if downside risks to the outlook materialise, including those stemming from exchange rate dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.36,0)">Indeed, an appreciation of the euro could significantly affect euro area inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.38,0)">There should be no doubt here: the ECB will not accept inflation settling at levels that are inconsistent with its aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">This is why we took action, and why we will continue to provide the monetary accommodation that is necessary to support the convergence of inflation to 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Our commitment to preserve favourable financing conditions will support the strengthening of inflation dynamics in two main ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">First, over the coming months, where uncertainty is still high and the private sector is reluctant to take risks, fiscal policy will remain the main actor in the stabilisation effort and, as such, a key channel for transmitting monetary policy to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Confidence in future financing conditions will remove obstacles to fiscal policy playing this role in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">And when uncertainty recedes, monetary transmission through the private sector will gain more traction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Firms will be able to take full advantage of favourable financing conditions and carry out their investment plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">This is the second expansionary effect – and, crucially, the ECB’s commitment to preserve favourable financing conditions makes this effect more powerful over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">That commitment is linked to supporting the return of inflation to our aim over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Given our projections – which foresee that even in a mild scenario inflation would rise to only 1.5% in 2023 – this means that financing conditions will need to remain very supportive even as growth accelerates from next year onwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">As a result, monetary policy will become more accommodative relative to the growth outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Also in the light of the prolonged deviations of inflation below our aim over a number of years, a steady return to 2% is essential to anchor inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Investing in Europe’s recovery But firms need certainty about more than just financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">They also need reassurance about future demand and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">To lift the economy out of the crisis, governments need to wisely use the fiscal space created by our monetary policy and other key decisions at the European level – in particular joint EU borrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Next Generation EU   alone will provide fiscal support amounting to about 5% of euro area GDP, focused in particular on those countries that have been hit hardest by the crisis, including Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">We will exit this crisis with higher public and private debt levels everywhere, so achieving growth rates that remain higher than interest rates will be crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">For fiscal authorities, this means they should focus on high-quality, productive investment spending that lifts potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.59,0)">Many European economies have seen their growth capacity decline over recent decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.73,0)">Capital deepening virtually stagnated, leading to lacklustre productivity performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Reversing this trend is necessary to ensure debt sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.61,0)">The total factor productivity   contribution is taken as the residual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">NGEU spending should focus on investment in those areas with the greatest potential to boost productivity and labour participation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">If this happens, the possible gains are large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">According to ECB estimates, NGEU funds could increase real output in the euro area by up to 1.5% by 2026 relative to the baseline scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">High efficiency and institutional quality will be key to maximising the benefits of NGEU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">For Italy, the possible gains are larger: up to 3.5% of GDP if funds are well invested.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Moreover, NGEU grants could reduce public debt-to-GDP ratio by more than 5 percentage points by 2026.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">The gains will be highest if investment spending is targeted at the technologies and sectors that will drive the economy after the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">More than half of EU firms expect to increase their use of digital technologies in response to COVID-19.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">This requires enhancing digital skills and infrastructure, in order to be ready to face the digital challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">For example, in the euro area the share of individuals with at least basic digital skills ranges from 79% in the Netherlands to 42% in Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">If spent wisely, NGEU funds will contribute to significantly improving technological capabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">This would not only ensure that all our economies are ready to take advantage of this transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">It would also reduce one of the differences in structural conditions that has contributed to divergences among European economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">NGEU funds can be directly used to accelerate digitalisation, for instance by increasing the use of e-government services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The fiscal space that NGEU creates in national budgets can also be reallocated towards digital training and education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In the past, pandemics have sparked innovation in how economies are structured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Recent research shows that government interventions during the 1918 influenza pandemic helped spur innovation after the pandemic ended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I see no reason why we cannot do the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.84,0)">However, we must also recognise that digitalisation tends to reward those with higher skills and so could exacerbate inequalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Therefore, during the transition attention should be given to the social implications of reallocating resources towards more digitalised sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Investment to support the transition to a low-carbon economy will also be a key component of the recovery from the pandemic throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Italy should not be lagging behind in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Conclusion The coronavirus shock may be a turning point for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The agreements reached by EU leaders in recent months show that we all understand that addressing challenges together brings benefits to everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Our common response at the European level must now continue, in order to provide clarity on the policies that will be implemented to underpin and strengthen the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">To put the economy on a solid, durable growth path consistent with the return of inflation to our aim, monetary and fiscal policy need to remain accommodative for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Fiscal policy must focus on investment in order to boost potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.72,0)">We must resist the temptation to take hazardous shortcuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Only growth, not financial alchemy, can guarantee debt sustainability and pave the way for prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Lagarde, C.  , “Monetary policy in a pandemic emergency”, keynote speech at the ECB Forum on Central Banking, 11 November; and Panetta,
