    <h3> Speaker: Peter Praet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)"> Sound money, sound finances, a competitive economy – principles of a european culture of stability Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the symposium on “Perspectives for a common stability culture in Europe” organised by Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung,Berlin, 27 February 2012 Ladies and gentlemen,   It is an honour for me to have been invited here today to speak about the emergence of a European culture of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.61,0)">In Germany, such a culture is the outcome of what is known as Ordnungspolitik.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">It involves the primacy of sound monetary policy, sound finances and solid institutions, as well as ensuring fair competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Ordnungspolitik is firmly entrenched in German governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Its intellectual roots can be traced all the way back to the Freiburg School of Economics and in particular Walter Eucken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">It advocates an institutional framework promoting a free, yet ethically responsible, market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Within this framework, economic actors are then free to pursue their own goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Speaking at the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung today, let me also pay tribute to the first German Chancellor of the Federal Republic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">He firmly believed in a new Germany, inside a peaceful and integrated Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">He once said, “ Unser Ziel ist es, daß Europa einmal ein großes, gemeinsames Haus für die Europäer wird, ein Haus der Freiheit”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Today, I will provide you my reflections about how I see the crisis changing both Europe and Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.18,0)">There are changes in governance, tighter rules, some new institutions have been created to complete the architecture of EMU, and some of the older institutions have tighter mandates and instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">There is now realism and acceptance of the need for such changes as never before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">My reflections are organised along the subjects of sound money, sound finances and a competitive economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.79,0)">Some lessons and final thoughts will conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Overall, I think there are signs of stabilization that give us confidence about the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.74,0)">Sound money The financial crisis we are experiencing is not a “monetary crisis” in its essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The ECB has secured price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">It is also remarkable that inflation expectations have remained anchored throughout the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Looking ahead they remain anchored even in the distant future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Yet, the ECB has to continue earning the confidence it has acquired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The operational framework of the Eurosystem, through which monetary policy is implemented, has proven to be resilient and effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The ECB was the first central bank to respond to what was initially called “financial turmoil”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">A very important part of the ECB’s policy responses came in the form of cutting rates and providing liquidity against collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">In order to prevent a serious credit-crunch – and preserve the proper transmission of monetary policy – the ECB embarked in a series of exceptional monetary measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">For example, last December the ECB decided to hold two very long-term refinancing operations with a maturity of 3 years against adequate collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The first was conducted already in December, and the second is forthcoming.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">These measures are supporting the liquidity planning of banks, thus allowing the flow of credit from banks to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Hence, the ECB has delivered in line with its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">However, looking ahead we have to ensure that this will remain so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Risks that monetary policy may be overburdened in the future need to be counteracted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The primacy of sound monetary policy and price stability must be safeguarded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">It is our shared asset in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">In order to safeguard sound money, the other elements of Ordnungspolitik also need firming up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I now turn to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Sound finances Sound finances entail two components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The first is sound public finances, while the second is provided by sound financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">The crisis has shown that fiscal stability and financial stability are linked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.19,0)">Unfortunately, both have struggled throughout this long, and mutating, financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Yet, there has been progress on both components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.56,0)">A point sometime missed is that some of the root causes of the crisis go very far back in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.85,0)">In many societies there was an excessive build-up of debt in recent decades: both sovereign debt and private sector debt  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.49,0)">Warnings were voiced repeatedly, also by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.71,0)">But, the start of serious debt consolidation was continuously postponed, offloading on future generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.83,0)">There was too much complacency, although many debt sustainability analyses showed that there was a limited period of time to truly address the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.01,0)">The crisis has cut the room for manoeuvre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.22,0)">The economic downturn that followed the Lehman bankruptcy – which many refer to as the “Great Recession” – changed all this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">It has brought the debt problem forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.16,0)">The crisis and the recession have forced euro area countries to face their responsibilities right away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.61,0)">This entails undertaking very substantial adjustments now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me provide you with some reflections about the two main components of sound finances in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.26,0)">The fiscal component of sound finances Failings in national governance caused severe fiscal strains in quite a number of euro area countries, while, at the same time, European governance lacked teeth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.07,0)">The Stability and Growth Pact was even weakened in 2003 - at the behest of some of the largest euro area countries - and then reformed in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.77,0)">This was not the only problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.29,0)">Financial market discipline, another powerful deterrent, was virtually absent until well into the crisis, but came back with a vengeance over recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.66,0)">Financial markets became dysfunctional driving sovereign risk premia of a number of euro area countries ever higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.91,0)">Hence, two important deterrents were missing in the first decade of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">After the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, automatic fiscal stabilisers cushioned the impact of the crisis, and many European governments introduced economic stimuli programs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">On top of this, the financial recapitalisation required was immense in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">As a consequence, deficits soared and governments’ indebtedness surged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The overall public sector deficit in the euro area increased from 1.4% of GDP in 2006 to 6.2% in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">At the same time, general government debt in the euro area rose from 68.5% in 2006 to around 85.6% in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.45,0)">However, according to the European Commission’s latest forecast, the deficit ratio should gradually decline to below 3% of GDP by 2013, while the aggregate debt ratio in that year is projected to exceed 90% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.22,0)">This is a challenging legacy of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Today, a number of countries have embarked in fiscal consolidation programs, and as you know, Greece, Ireland and Portugal are now implementing ambitious adjustment programs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Hence, fiscal policies are adjusting as a response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">But how can public finances be returned to soundness more fundamentally?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">How can sound fiscal institutions, and therefore sound fiscal governance, be secured in the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The new fiscal compact – that is soon to be ratified - is a step in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.53,0)">It addresses some of the weaknesses of the previous fiscal governance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The fiscal compact has two main elements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The first is the mandatory introduction of a balanced budget rule and a correction mechanism for deviations from balanced budgets at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The second element envisages a strengthening of the excessive deficit procedure within the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">If effectively implemented, the fiscal compact will help to anchor market expectations on the sustainability of public finances in Europe  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Yet, Governments now need to prove their commitment to these new fiscal rules by ensuring a rapid ratification of the new Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in EMU, which includes the fiscal compact, its transposition into national law and by living up to the rules and the spirit of the fiscal compact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.33,0)">The financial stability component of sound finances August 2007 saw the start of the financial turmoil with an increasing loss of confidence in the financial markets, a drying-up of liquidity and an increase in both risk premia and counterparty risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.85,0)">Ever larger volumes of so called AAA-rated privately issued assets became “toxic”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.67,0)">In September 2008, after Lehman’s bankruptcy, money markets virtually seized up, financial losses rose rapidly and a process of deleveraging set in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.28,0)">Financial stress spilled over to the real economy with a sudden and very severe impact on trade and growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.25,0)">This led to the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">How can financial markets be made sound again?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This question raises many issues which I have not time to address here today but are fundamental, like: how can a better pricing of risk be insured?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.78,0)">how can asset price bubbles be detected and corrected in time?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.11,0)">how can procyclicality of financial markets be attenuated?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">and how can the financial system better align with the needs of the real economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">There have been several institutional developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">A new supervisory framework has been put in place in the EU in order to share information and best practices, foster cooperation and identify sources of systemic financial risks at an early stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It consists of two pillars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The first covers micro-prudential supervision and comprises the European Banking Authority as well as other supervisory agencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Supervisory colleges for pan-European banks are also starting to operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The second pillar is dedicated to macro-prudential supervision and is centred on the European Systemic Risk Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The ESRB can issue warnings and macro-prudential recommendations whenever necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">In addition, the new Basel III rules are being implemented to secure adequate capitalization of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.62,0)">What explains the rapid contagion that has characterised the sovereign debt crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.33,0)">As I already said, the crisis has revealed weaknesses in the prevention side of economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.45,0)">But, there were also other gaps in the architecture of euro area institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.65,0)">This became apparent in early 2010 after the onset of the sovereign debt crisis in Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.26,0)">One after the other, fiscally weak euro area countries saw their sovereign risk premia rising and their rating downgraded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">As a consequence, their sovereign spreads soared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.06,0)">An adverse feedback loop set in: a vicious circle by which weak sovereign hurt banks and the need for bank recapitalization and refinancing hurt sovereign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Risk aversion by market participants soared: there was contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.93,0)">The architecture of the Economic and Monetary Union   had been designed without a proper framework to manage a sovereign debt crisis  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">One side of this institutional gap is now being addressed through the establishment of firewalls such as the European Financial Stability Facility   - and the forthcoming European Stability Mechanism   – with their framework for sovereign crisis management and resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Some further steps are still needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For example, there are only national arrangements for interventions to resolve crises of big pan-European banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Some account for a large share of national GDP of their home country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.06,0)">Thus, while progress was made on the sovereign side: we still lack a European crisis management and resolution framework for systemically important banks; there are as yet no funds earmarked or clear provisions to help in the recapitalization of big banks  ; and the fundamental issue of institutions that are “too big to fail” has only started to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Hence, it is fair to say that while a lot has already been achieved, some hard work remains ahead of us in order to secure fundamentally sound finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">A competitive economy International competitiveness, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">a free, flexible, innovative and open economy, is the third pillar of Ordnungspolitik.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Economic agents need to fulfil the highest global standards of efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.72,0)">On this front, too, matters in individual euro area countries have not, however, developed as would have been desired since the launch of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.47,0)">There have been persistent economic imbalances in several euro area countries, and slow productivity growth in a number of others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.01,0)">The “Great Recession”, the epicentre of which initially seemed to be far away, has exposed and exacerbated these weaknesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.88,0)">How could this go on for so long?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Diverse national factors played a role: as a result competitiveness changed significantly and heterogeneities build up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.8,0)">Hence, there was also a lack of macro-economic surveillance and too little focus on job creation and improving growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.62,0)">Many of these weaknesses are now being addressed by national policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">A number of euro area countries have started serious structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">But looking ahead, how can the euro area remain competitive more fundamentally?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">A new Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure   is now in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">A warning system is helping us in identifying risks arising from large and protracted swings in competitiveness as well as sustained budget deficits at an early stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">How?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.24,0)">By monitoring amongst others, domestic prices, costs of production, wages, unit labour costs, export market shares, and productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The MIP complements the fiscal compact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Hans-Gert Pöttering, the President of the Konrad Adenauer Stiftung and our host today, has put it very clearly: “ Die Durchsetzung umfassender Strukturreformen… kostet in erster Linie Kraft – nicht Geld”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">What have we learned from the crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.39,0)">The speed with which persistent imbalances in EMU can result in systemic risks was not fully understood prior to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.1,0)">An important lesson is that due to high trade and financial integration in the euro area, the build-up of imbalances in any individual euro area country increasingly affects all others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">In other words, there are greater spillover effects on account of increasing interconnectedness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.46,0)">The financial contagion of the sovereign debt crisis is a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.4,0)">Therefore, substantial risks to fiscal and financial stability can build up if structural reforms, liberalisation and fiscal consolidation are postponed for too long, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.21,0)">in the absence of an effective Ordnungspolitik.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.08,0)">This leads to stress in our societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">For each euro area country, the pressures for maintaining sound finances and remaining competitive have grown tremendously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">At the same time, also the incentives of each euro area country to monitor its peers have grown to virtually the same extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Hence, my message is that each euro area country is a stakeholder in the success of the others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.95,0)">Some final thoughts The global financial crisis has been a traumatic event in the still short history of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Yet, it has also been a wake-up call.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">In my view it has been a catalytic event that is changing both Europe and Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">The contours of a shared European culture of stability are gradually emerging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is a culture of respect of rules and institutions and transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">This will support the economic growth that is indispensable to heal the legacy of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">But let us be modest and bear in mind that solutions to the crisis are only good: if they are thought through carefully, if they are widely accepted and shared by European citizens, and if they are widely implemented across euro area countries and, when needed, improved and strengthened as necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As Konrad Adenauer put it many years ago, “ Die Einheit Europas war ein Traum Weniger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Sie wurde eine Hoffnung für viele.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Sie ist heute eine Notwendigkeit für alle”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">I would like to thank Francesco Mongelli for his contributions to the preparation of this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">A “6-pack” came into force in December 2011, and a “2-pack” is soon to be finalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">They already envisage diverse strengthenings of the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Two more supervisory agencies were also created: the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority   and the European Securities and Markets Authority  .</span>
