    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.11,0)"> Why Europe still needs cash Contribution by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB for Project Syndicate Payment systems in Europe are facing upheaval.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">With the digital revolution offering ever-faster and more convenient means for settling transactions, cash seems to some to have no future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.51,0)">But to write off the role of banknotes and coins in the economy would be a mistake.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Non-cash payment options have been proliferating in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Credit cards, online transfers, and direct-debit payments are already well established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Now, smartphone-enabled digital-payment solutions and mobile wallets are also gaining ground.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">The emergence of potentially disruptive innovations like distributed ledger technologies indicate that further and possibly fundamental change may be on the horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Independent of these new and incipient options, there are a number of studies lobbying to abolish cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.82,0)">Advocates of a cashless society tend to fall into three distinct camps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The first camp, the alchemists, wants to overcome the restrictions that the zero lower bound   imposes on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.24,0)">The second, the law and order camp, wants to cancel the primary means of payment for illicit activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">And the third camp, the fintech   alliance, anticipates major business opportunities arising from the elimination of the high storage, issuance, and handling costs of cash that the financial industry currently faces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But the arguments for going cashless do not withstand scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Start with the alchemists’ case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.77,0)">It is true that, in an environment of very low interest rates, the conduct of monetary policy becomes difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Yet experience has shown that the effective lower bound is different from the ZLB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Indeed, negative interest rates have worked, without triggering a flight to cash, especially when combined with outright asset purchases, long-term credit operations  , and forward guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.39,0)">As such, negative interest rates should be understood as a specific non-standard monetary-policy instrument different from low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.04,0)">The law-and-order camp’s case for banning cash also wilts under scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">By acting as a store of value and a means of payment, cash fulfills an important social function for many law-abiding citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.59,0)">Would anyone suggest forbidding private ownership of luxury cars or gems because criminals like them?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.67,0)">Harming the decent majority in order punish a misbehaving minority would be like cracking a nut with a sledgehammer – and breaking the table it is on in the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Finally, the fintech alliance promises that, with its innovative digital-payment solutions, it can ease the conduct of financial transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.42,0)">Customers would no longer need to carry wads of cash or search for ATMs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">But it is an open question whether the still highly fragmented digital-payment sector will help customers more than the companies offering the payment solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.38,0)">There is one more major problem with the arguments for a cashless society: most people, at least in the eurozone, don’t want it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.94,0)">According to an as-yet-unpublished European Central Bank survey of 65,000 eurozone residents, almost 80% of all point-of-sale transactions are conducted in cash; and, in terms of value, more than half of payments are made in cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">As is often the case in Europe, the differences among member states are pronounced: the share of cash transactions ranges from 42% in Finland to 92% in Malta.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">But, overall, the public’s commitment to cash remains strong – and is becoming stronger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In fact, growth in overall demand for cash is outpacing nominal GDP growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In the last five years, the average annual growth rate of euro banknotes was 4.9% by value and 6.2% by piece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This rise includes denominations that are predominantly used for transactions, rather than for savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">These findings confirm the appropriateness of the ECB’s neutral stance on payments, which allows for both cash and cashless payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This approach is based on four principles:   technological safety,   efficiency,   technological neutrality, and   freedom of choice for users of the respective means of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The ECB’s supreme objective is to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">To support that objective, it supplies safe central-bank liquidity, in the form of both bank-held central-bank reserves and banknotes  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.35,0)">If Europe were to abolish cash, it would cut off people’s only direct link to central-bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">In a democracy, such a link helps to foster public acceptance of central-bank independence, by reinforcing the trust and support of the people in the conduct of effective monetary policymaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The ECB will continue to provide banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">We will also facilitate the further development of an integrated, innovative, and competitive market for retail payment solutions in the eurozone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">If, one day, cash is replaced by electronic means of payments, that decision should reflect the will of the people, not the force of lobby groups.</span>
