    <span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)"> Fostering global growth Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the panel during the G30 International Banking Seminar,Lima, Peru, 11 October 2015 I would like to thank Jacob and Jean-Claude for inviting me to participate in this panel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">You will not be surprised that I will focus on the growth challenge faced by the euro area countries in my intervention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Let me stress from the outset that I believe that the euro area can make a much stronger contribution to global growth than it has done so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">But for this to happen, we need a stronger reform impetus in many euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">To substantiate this claim, I would like to address two questions: first, where do we stand on growth and reforms in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">And second, which structural reforms are still needed to support stronger and sustainable growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Where do we stand on growth and reforms in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Growth has been recovering in the euro area, albeit at a modest pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Output growth has been gathering pace throughout 2014 and in the first half of 2015 and employment has been increasing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">However, developments are still uneven across member countries and it is not clear that the recovery can be sustained in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Our main concern is that across euro area countries domestic vulnerabilities are still very large, which implies a limited ability to withstand adverse external shocks and to kick start a new phase of sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.06,0)">The vulnerabilities of many euro area countries are related to the high stock of debt, both public and private, and to a number of structural rigidities and institutional bottlenecks that prevent an optimal allocation of resources across factors of production, and thus limit total factor productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">The current environment not only urgently calls for the implementation of structural reforms, but also provides the right conditions for their implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">With our monetary policy, the ECB is greatly contributing to an environment favourable to implementing structural reforms: our accommodative monetary policy stance helps countries to gain time, time to implement the necessary measures to increase resilience and thus support sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However, there is only a limited role for demand-side policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.46,0)">Fiscal space is limited and monetary policy cannot carry the burden of the adjustment alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">For the euro area to become more resilient and sustain stronger growth, national governments need to bring about further structural change  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Work in this regard has already started, and the reform wave of the countries hardest hit by the crisis is showing some initial results, such as a GDP recovery related to comprehensive labour market reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Other reforms, mainly on product markets, are expected to bring about GDP gains, but they need to be implemented in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">However, since 2013, very low financing costs for sovereigns and rising share prices have eased the pressure to implement more difficult policies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">By definition, for structural policies to be most effective, a long-term commitment, continuous implementation and strong reform ownership are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is the only way to permanently change expectations and growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">This leads me to our second, more concrete, question: Which structural reforms are still needed to support stronger and sustainable growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">To start with, let me stress that all euro area countries, albeit to different degrees, still need to implement structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">There are a number of credible reforms that are able to increase permanently total factor productivity; to affect confidence; and to help reduce uncertainty and increase investment and sustainable demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">In particular, for the euro area I see the need to forcefully work on: reducing red tape – by easing licensing procedures and facilitating access to credit by viable firms; improving the judicial systems – including the effectiveness of insolvency regimes; increasing the efficiency of the public administration and tax systems; reducing entry barriers in sectors sheltered from competition; and reducing hiring costs and skill mismatch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">These reforms would unlock immediately “hidden” demand, increase economic resilience and facilitate the working of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.68,0)">Among these reforms I believe that particular attention needs to be given to all legal, administrative and bureaucratic impediments that can lead to an increase of the overall costs for debt workouts, make the distinction between viable and non-viable firms more difficult, and hamper firms’ exit from and entry to markets as well as investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">In concrete terms, this means improving the efficiency of insolvency regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">In corporate debt restructuring, experience to date shows that an effective insolvency regime is critical to facilitate the early rescue of viable firms and the speedy exit of non-viable ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.29,0)">IMF analysis also shows that weak debt enforcement and ineffective insolvency frameworks tend to lower the recovery values of problem loans  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Our internal analysis finds that in order to be able to cope with high private debt ratios and to deleverage reasonably quickly, the strength of the insolvency framework is important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Also, recent analysis from the European Commission found evidence that in the presence of a high stock of private debt, the quality of insolvency frameworks is important for financial stability and for spurring entrepreneurship and thereby mitigating the impact of deleveraging on growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In particular, it was found that a good insolvency framework is associated with speedier adjustment of non-performing loan ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.56,0)">To highlight the differences in insolvency frameworks across euro area member countries, let me mention a few country figures: in Slovakia it takes on average 4 years to resolve an insolvency case, while in Portugal it takes 2 years and in Ireland it takes less than 5 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.82,0)">When looking at international practices, one can find three types of procedures through which firms can deal with debt restructuring: out-of-court procedures; hybrid preventive restructuring procedures; and formal insolvency or restructuring procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.2,0)">In the euro area countries formal insolvency procedures are very common, while out-of-court procedures have been much less used so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">However, voluntary out-of-court restructuring can provide a speedy, cost-effective and market-friendly alternative to court insolvency proceedings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.73,0)">This tool is particularly useful in cases where there is a lack of confidence in the institutional capacity to support the operation of the insolvency system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">In the past few years insolvency laws have been amended, in particular in Spain, Italy and Portugal, to better support early rescue of viable firms, to help the deleveraging process and to free up resources for further investment and thus productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">I believe that these reforms, if the effort to implement them continues, will help us to grow out of the current high private sector debt problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Of course, there are other possibilities and the list of potential reforms is long.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I could elaborate further, but my time here is unfortunately limited so I chose to constrain myself to this crucial area of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusions Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">As I said at the beginning, the euro area can make a much stronger contribution to global growth than it has done so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The conditions are very favourable for a strong push for reforms; in particular, our monetary policy stance is supportive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Reforms should now focus on boosting productivity and reducing the burden of the high debt stock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Work in this direction has started and is ongoing, but the euro area governments need to continue on this track with more determination and impetus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Aiyar, S., Bergthaler, W., Garrido, J.
