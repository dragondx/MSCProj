    <span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)"> Presentation of the ECB Annual Report 2012 to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory Statement by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB,Brussels, 24 April 2013 Madam Chair, Honourable members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, It is a great pleasure to present to you the European Central Bank’s Annual Report for 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The ECB has always stressed that its independence must be accompanied by the highest standards of accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The Annual Report is central to discharging this obligation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In my introductory remarks, I will first give an overview of the economic and monetary developments in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I will then set out our assessment of economic policies and governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Finally, I would like to make some comments on future steps towards establishing a banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.2,0)">Economic and monetary developments in 2012 Last year we were faced with a very challenging environment for monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.58,0)">The sovereign debt crisis kept financial market stress high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.57,0)">This confidence crisis has adversely affected growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.61,0)">Following two years of growth, GDP declined by 0.6% in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.19,0)">Private consumption declined and investment faltered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.44,0)">Unemployment increased to unprecedented levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In this context, monetary and loan dynamics have been subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">M3 growth strengthened moderately to 3.0% in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.9,0)">But it essentially de-linked from credit creation, which instead became increasingly weak, with annual loan growth to the private sector turning negative over the course of the year to stand at -0.2% in December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Annual HICP inflation reached an average of 2.5% in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.27,0)">Inflation developments have been driven by high energy prices and increases in indirect taxes – which have been one element of well needed fiscal consolidation plans As we had forecast consistently throughout 2012, inflation rates have since declined rapidly standing at 1.7% in March this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The Governing Council remains strongly committed to its price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Long-term inflation expectations have remained firmly anchored in line with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Over the course of 2012 decisive measures were taken to support the transmission of the historically low key interest rates to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.78,0)">The three-year LTROs launched at the turn of the year have prevented that funding stress in interbank money markets led to a disorderly unwinding of bank balance sheets, which could have had serious consequences for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.05,0)">Towards the middle of 2012 unfounded fears of the reversibility of the euro led to a sharp increase in sovereign bond and bank lending rates in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">In order to safeguard the singleness of monetary policy and ensure a smoother transmission of interest rates to the real economy, the Governing Council announced in August its readiness to undertake Outright Monetary Transactions   in secondary markets for sovereign bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The announcement of OMTs has proven to be an effective backstop against unfounded fears of reversibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">However, the transmission channel cannot be fully repaired if governments do not address the root causes of the crisis; this includes ensuring sustainable public debt levels, improving competitiveness, strengthening bank resilience and further improving the institutional setting of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.46,0)">Economic policies and EMU governance The financial and sovereign debt crises left significant scars on public finances in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The government debt ratio increased by around 25 percentage points between 2007 and 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.43,0)">This reflected the workings of automatic fiscal stabilisers and discretionary expansionary measures to sustain incomes in times of falling economic activity, the sizeable public support to the banking sector, and, in some cases, the continuation of unhealthy fiscal trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Since 2010 a number of euro area governments have embarked on a determined consolidation path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.81,0)">As a result, government deficit ratios declined significantly from their peak levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.07,0)">In 2012, the euro area government deficit-to-GDP ratio was about 3 percentage points lower than the deficit recorded in 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Fiscal adjustment has been particularly strong in countries under market pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(14,255,0)">In Greece, for example, the structural primary balance is estimated to have improved by more than 14 percentage points of GDP between 2009 and 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The improvement was 5.7 percentage points for Portugal, 4.3 for Ireland, 3.9 for Spain and 3.6 for Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Past and current consolidation efforts are gradually bearing fruit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.78,0)">Economic adjustment, both internal and external, has been significant, has implied high costs in terms of unemployment and should not put into risk of unraveling now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.19,0)">This will allow debt ratios to stabilise and subsequently to decline to safe levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">In order to generate growth and reduce unemployment, continued efforts to consolidate public finances should be accompanied by determined structural reforms, thereby promoting a mutually reinforcing process between restored fiscal sustainability, financial market access and future economic growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">The structural reforms should be ambitious, broad-ranging and with long-lasting effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">They should address product markets, network industries, labour markets, and the modernisation of public administration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">To support employment, wage-setting should become flexible and aligned with productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">These reforms will help to regain competitiveness, increase employment, set the foundations for sustainable growth and support the return of confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">It is worth noting that several stressed countries already did significant reforms which are reflected in the competitiveness gains since 2008 in terms of relative unit labour costs  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.67,0)">In fact, since then and in relation to other Euro Area members, Ireland reduced its unit labour costs by 19.4%, Spain by 9.5%, Greece by 8.9% Portugal by 6.6%and Italy by just 0.1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">The reductions achieved against their more significant 36 trading partners were even higher and, more importantly, the gains since 2008 sizably reduced the cumulative evolution of their ULCs since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The significant losses of competitiveness from the inception of the euro and the beginning of the crisis in 2008 have been meanwhile corrected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.08,0)">In fact, relatively to the other Euro Area members from 1999 to the end of last year Greece reduced its ULCs by 5.8% and Portugal by 2.4% whereas Spain increased theirs by only 2.9% and Ireland by 1.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">These improvements in competitiveness were also reflected in significant reductions of the external accounts of all the stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.28,0)">The latest Commission economic forecast indicates that for 2013 all stressed countries will have an external surplus with the exception of Greece with a deficit 2% of GDP well below previous results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The adjustment efforts of the countries under market stress have been positive and certainly have also contributed to the improved financial market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Looking back at 2012, reforms at the European level implied that significant progress has been made in putting in place the necessary building blocks for a deeper and more stable EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Europe’s leaders recognised the need to complement EMU with a banking union, a fiscal union, a genuine economic union and eventually a deeper political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">We now have an ambitious agenda and a clear long term vision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The progress towards sound public finances has been underpinned by institutional reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">New rules were applied to strengthen oversight of budgets and to monitor emerging macroeconomic imbalances more effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The signature of the fiscal compact was a significant milestone in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Looking ahead we need to remain ambitious, with the ultimate aim to secure stability and prosperity for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">This year should be aimed toward putting these decisions into practice by focusing on their proper implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Completing banking union I would now like to make some remarks on further steps towards establishing a banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The recent agreement in the trilogue on the single supervisory mechanism   represents a very important step.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">It is of crucial importance for the efficient functioning of the euro area and represents a major step forward in European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The necessary preparations for the SSM are underway at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">However, key organisational decisions can only be taken once the legal text has entered into force and the Supervisory Board has been set-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Therefore the timely adoption of the Regulation by early summer is crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">We look forward to constructive discussions with the European Parliament on the agreement covering the modalities of accountability and confidentiality on supervisory matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">We are confident we will be able to strike the right balance between thorough democratic accountability, confidentiality, operational effectiveness and the respect of the ECB’s independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Another priority is the establishment of a single resolution mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This is a necessary complement to the SSM and fundamental to the creation of a banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I see three key features of a single resolution mechanism which I want to emphasise today: a set of instruments, an authority and a fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">First, the single resolution mechanism requires a comprehensive set of enforceable resolution tools and powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive provides a harmonised resolution framework for Europe and a clear tool-kit of powers and instruments in all Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It should include provisions on bail-in and introduce depositor preference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">This will contribute to predictability, avoid disruption to essential banking services and shield taxpayers from excessive exposure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The urgent adoption and implementation of this Directive is therefore of paramount importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Second, the single resolution mechanism requires a strong authority at its centre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.68,0)">Mere coordination between national authorities is not sufficient for cross-border resolution in crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This single resolution authority should have independent decision-making powers that would enable prompt and decisive action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">It should ensure that we re-shift the balance between bail-outs and bail-ins, where the private sector is held responsible for its risk-taking decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Those that benefit from the gains should also pay for the losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">The single resolution authority should ensure a resolution strategy that takes account of all relevant factors, notably financial stability, the impact on the real economy and a least cost principle for the taxpayer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">To do this, the single resolution authority should ensure costs are first borne by shareholders and creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However this may not be sufficient, therefore the single resolution authority should have a privately-funded European resolution fund at its disposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Only then, and as a last resort, should it have access to a temporary and fiscally neutral public backstop, the contributions to which should be paid by the private sector either via ex post levies or, more normally, as a result of the reprivatisation of the intermediary institutions   or other good assets resulting from the resolution process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Progress in these elements of a future banking union is very important in the present economic environment of low growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.97,0)">Part of the European problem has to do with the situation of the banking sector: pressed for capital, intending to deleverage and risk averse in managing credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.75,0)">Consequently, credit is being contained although it is virtually impossible to disentangle the contribution of supply restrictions versus weak demand in explaining the average decline of credit to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.59,0)">In the markets there is the suspicion that banks’ balance-sheets need more repair with full recognition of potential losses and that is also affecting the lending behaviour of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">No one has provided clear evidence that this is true and that is why the balance-sheet assessment that the SSM has to conduct before actually starting supervision is so important to re-establish market confidence in our banks to reduce their funding costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Therefore, the establishment of the SSM, the possible use of direct European recapitalisation and the creation of a single resolution mechanism will decisively contribute to the desirable separation of banks and sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">To regain market confidence, restoring full banking sector health must be a priority in order to create improved growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is why the banking union project is crucial at this particular moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Economic growth in Europe is now essential to complete the adjustment and the rebalancing that have been going on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Therefore, it is of paramount importance that the momentum is maintained towards implementing structural reforms at national level and towards building a stronger Economic and Monetary Union through European institutional reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">I trust that the European Parliament will continue to play an active and positive role in this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">I thank you for your attention and stand at your disposal for questions.</span>
