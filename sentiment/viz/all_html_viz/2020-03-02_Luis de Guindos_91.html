    <span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)"> London, 2 March 2020 Remarks at the European Economics and Financial Centre Remarks by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the European Economics and Financial Centre I am delighted to be here today at the European Economics and Financial Centre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I will use this opportunity to provide a very brief overview of the economic situation and financial system vulnerabilities in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Prior to the coronavirus outbreak, the outlook for global economic activity had been showing some signs of improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The US-China “phase-one” agreement had contributed to reduce uncertainty around trading relationships, as had the arrangement of a Brexit transition period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.32,0)">The global weakness, however, remained a drag on euro area growth by dampening manufacturing activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Meanwhile, the euro area growth outlook showed signs of stabilisation after the persistent deceleration throughout 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Forward-looking survey indicators pointed to mild improvements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">Although the latest industrial output figures demonstrated that overcoming the manufacturing recession continued to be challenging, we could draw some comfort from the fact that no spillovers from the manufacturing to the services sector were observed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In the third quarter of 2019, euro area consumption increased by 0.5% quarter-on-quarter, while resilient retail sales and broadly stable consumer confidence indicated robust consumer spending also for the months ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The services sector continues to be strong and survey indicators remain in expansionary territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.25,0)">Consumption has been supported by positive labour market developments: employment in the euro area expanded by 0.3% quarter-on-quarter at the end of 2019, while unemployment declined further to 7.4% in December, reaching its lowest level since May 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.21,0)">Over recent weeks, however, the coronavirus added a new layer of uncertainty to global and euro area growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.3,0)">The outbreak has the potential to affect the euro area economy through both demand- and supply-side channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.2,0)">Euro area foreign demand could be directly hit as a result of quarantine measures in China and the associated suspension of production lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.64,0)">This may affect euro area exports, and could cause disruption in global supply chains and the production of intermediate products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.56,0)">The euro area services sector, too, could be affected by travel disruptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.25,0)">If the virus spreads more widely, domestic firms could be more directly affected due, for example, to supply chain delays.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We remain vigilant and will closely monitor all incoming data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Our forward guidance steers the orientation of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">In any case, the Governing Council stands ready to adjust all its instruments, as appropriate, to ensure that inflation moves towards its aim in a sustained manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In terms of nominal developments, headline inflation increased to 1.4% in January, up from 1.3% in December 2019, reflecting mainly higher energy and food inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Measures of underlying inflation are subdued, although they have mildly increased from earlier lows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Wage growth remains resilient and broad-based and is expected to support up inflation in the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.5,0)">The decline in unemployment and the tightening of labour markets have further increased labour cost pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Recent data on negotiated wages continue to signal robust wage growth, which is expected to gradually push up underlying inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.79,0)">However, the weaker growth momentum is delaying the pass-through to inflation, as firms appear to be absorbing wage rises in their profit margins rather than passing them on to customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">An ample degree of monetary accommodation is still necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The policy stimulus that is in place is working its way through the economy and is expected to support growth and job creation, a key precondition for inflation to move towards our medium-term inflation aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">At the same time, financial stability vulnerabilities have increased over recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.42,0)">Global financial markets have been impacted by intensified concerns about the spread of the virus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.09,0)">Decoupled from fundamentals, higher valuations of some asset classes may have left them more vulnerable to disorderly asset price corrections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.44,0)">Low profitability of euro area banks and increased size and risk-taking of the non-banks continue to be important vulnerabilities in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.45,0)">In the banking sector, signs of increased risk taking require close monitoring, as do search for yield and increasing liquidity risk in the investment fund sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">This challenging environment reminds us of the importance that European and Monetary Union becomes more resilient to adverse shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.84,0)">The banking union remains incomplete without EDIS and visible progress is needed on capital markets union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">In particular, Brexit calls for developing capital markets in areas where the EU financial system currently strongly relies on the City.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">At this stage, CMU should be a priority for all EU members to strengthen capital market financing of the economy and cross-border risk sharing through deeper and integrated bond and equity markets.</span>
