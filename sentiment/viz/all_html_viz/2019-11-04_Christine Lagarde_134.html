    <h3> Speaker: Christine Lagarde </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)"> Laudatory speech Laudatory speech by Christine Lagarde, President of the ECB, for Dr Wolfgang Schäuble at the VdZ Publishers’ Night, Berlin, 4 November 2019 The English philosopher John Stuart Mill once observed that “a great statesman is he who knows when to depart from traditions, as well as when to adhere to them.” It is with these words in mind that I would like to celebrate Wolfgang’s contribution to public life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">You embody what I see as the model of “Germany in Europe”: the Germany that is an implacable defender of its values and a beacon of liberalism and democracy; but also the Germany that is ready to move when needed to uphold the European idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.59,0)">This event is not about the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.99,0)">It’s not about monetary policy or other economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It’s about you, Wolfgang.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.31,0)">So I will not talk about monetary policy or anything related to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">I was asked to speak this evening when I was still Managing Director of the IMF, and I was honoured to do so in recognition of our long shared history as colleagues and friends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">But the occasion has taken on added meaning in the light of my new role working for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">There are few who have done so much for Europe, over so long a period, as you, Wolfgang.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I do not intend to use my remarks this evening to recall our many private conversations – they shall remain private – nor your many achievements: we all know what they are.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">I would like instead to focus on three of the qualities that I have personally witnessed, and that have marked you out as one of the pre-eminent leaders of your generation: your commitment, your rigour and your statesmanship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Wolfgang is receiving this award tonight in recognition of his commitment to a unified Europe and stable democracy in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Commitment is a quality that has run like a thread throughout your public life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">On this very day 30 years ago, only a few blocks from here, a million people demanded reform, democracy and freedom in the largest demonstration East Germany had ever seen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The fall of the Berlin Wall ushered in a profound transformation of German and European history, and you, as Minister of the Interior, were at the heart of this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Your commitment to your own country was always matched by a commitment to Europe – and you understood that each made the other stronger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">You saw immediately that German reunification could trigger optimism at home but anxiety abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">You knew that the best way for Germany to demonstrate the strength of its historical responsibility to Europe was to share a currency with its neighbours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">At the same time, a single currency would safeguard the single market against the risk of competitive devaluations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">So we can be thankful that, when the crisis erupted, you were once more in a position of influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">You reminded us that the euro has always been more than just a currency, and your unyielding defence of Europe was a bulwark in those febrile times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This is best captured in your belief that “if a solution is good for Europe, it is good for Germany; and if something is bad for Europe, it cannot be good for Germany.”   Of course, there have been different views about what constitutes a “good solution” for Europe, such as the appropriate balance between sharing risks and reducing risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">But I was always struck by the fact that, once you had agreed a way ahead with your European partners, you defended it with conviction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">I know that this was not easy: you had to tread a careful path between maintaining confidence in the euro at home and making the necessary reforms to safeguard the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The fact that 81% of Germans back the euro today, and the euro is more popular than ever among the wider European public, is testament to your skill in navigating that course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">What allowed you to achieve this was your second quality: your intellectual rigour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I have had many occasions to observe your forensic mind at work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">You combine the subtlety and foresight of a statesman with the scrutiny and attention to detail of a tax lawyer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.72,0)">You are notorious for your ability to pick apart shallow arguments and for your intolerance of superficiality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Your brilliant mind has often put you at the forefront of European debates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In the 1990s you were already writing about how to build a more deeply integrated European framework around the countries that would go on to share the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">You understood very early on that a monetary union comprising different sovereign states can only be sustainable if there is mutual trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">And you realised that trust does not emerge through declarations or treaties: it is built through actions that demonstrate the commitment of states to abide by the promises they have signed up to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.57,0)">You saw, in other words, that rules are not an end in themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">I have so often heard you mention the words “implementation, implementation”, because you knew that it is through faithful implementation and respect for the rules that trust builds up between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">And it is once trust has developed that more sharing of sovereignty can follow, which reinforces the strength of the Union and each of its members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In the face of changing reality, the challenge, of course, is how to ensure that governance is both credible and flexible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">As you have said yourself, “sticking to rules   does not mean a lack of creativity or originality.”   And it is this spirit that we will need to channel in our efforts to deepen our Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">If we are to move forward, we will certainly need leaders with your third quality: your statesmanship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">I have witnessed this in action during many long nights in Brussels and at global meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">There is much I have come to admire in you at such times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">You are a formidable negotiator, yet I have always known you to be fair and straight, allowing points of difference to be identified and solutions to be found.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">One of the qualities I cherish is that you are a straight-talker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.34,0)">You speak “Klartext”, as you say in German.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Your directness has always been married with loyalty and kindness, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">You know that successful diplomacy is built not through sheer force of personality, but through shared understanding with one’s partners, and especially within Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.95,0)">There were times during the crisis when you had to take tough decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.92,0)">You spoke recently of your sadness for those who have suffered, and said that you often think about how we could have done things differently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">That is the mark of a true statesman: the capacity to examine profoundly the best course of action, while avoiding false certainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Wolfgang, for the past two years you have taken on a new role as President of the Bundestag.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It is a step that befits a life dedicated to German and European democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Yet again, you are the right person, in the right place, at the right time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.27,0)">There is much concern today about the rise of extreme views and the coarsening of political discourse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">But displaying your characteristic sangfroid, you have reminded us to be confident in ourselves and in the resilience of our democratic institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">As you have said, “our free, democratic system based on the rule of law is so strong that nobody can wreck it, neither from within nor from without.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Anybody who tries will fail.”   I believe this is a message all of Europe needs to hear today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">A message of strength, resolve and courage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">A call to remember our better selves and not to allow self-doubt to drag us down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This is the message that rings loud from your career, Wolfgang.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.43,0)">For you, in the spirit of Max Weber, politics has always been more than a “Beruf”, it has been a “Berufung”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Not just a profession, but a calling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Germany and Europe have been blessed by this calling.</span>
