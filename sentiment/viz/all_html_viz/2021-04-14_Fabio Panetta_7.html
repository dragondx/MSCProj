    <span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)"> A digital euro to meet the expectations of Europeans Introductory remarks by Fabio Panetta, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the ECON Committee of the European Parliament Frankfurt am Main, 14 April 2021 Madam Chair, honourable members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Let me start by thanking you for inviting me to report on the outcome of the ECB’s public consultation on a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">We are publishing our analysis of the responses we received on our website today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">A digital euro can only be successful if it meets the needs and expectations of European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">This is why our consultation will provide valuable input for the Eurosystem’s decision – this summer – on whether we should start a digital euro project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The consultation will also inform future work on the design of a digital euro, if a project is launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">For the participants in the public consultation, the most important features of a digital euro are privacy, security and broad usability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In my remarks today, I will discuss how we can meet their expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But first let me share with you the main findings from our consultation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Main findings from the ECB’s public consultation We received more than 8,000 replies, an all-time record for ECB public consultations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The overwhelming majority of the responses came from citizens, while 460 were from businesses and professionals in the payments sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The consultation was open to everyone, and participants contributed on their own initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.12,0)">This means that the sample of respondents is not statistically representative of the European population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Nonetheless, the breadth and depth of the responses offer valuable insights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Our report discusses the results in detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Today I will therefore simply highlight the key findings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Privacy was considered to be the most important feature of a digital euro in about 43% of replies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Nevertheless, respondents recognise the need for the digital euro to have features that prevent illicit activities like money laundering or terrorist financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Other important characteristics include the possibility of using the digital euro for secure payments  , throughout the entire euro area  , without additional costs and offline  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Citizens and professionals agree that a digital euro should be integrated into existing payment infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The vast majority of respondents believe that banks, payment institutions and other intermediaries have an important role to play in providing services related to a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">They suggest, for example, that a digital euro should be integrated with mobile and online payments and banking services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">They expect the additional services that would build on the basic payment functionalities of a digital euro to trigger innovation and efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">A sizeable share of participants also highlight that the digital euro should make cross-border payments faster and less costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">And more than half of respondents are willing to test, adopt or contribute to the design of a digital euro in order to make it an effective means of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Privacy first As I have already mentioned, privacy emerges as the most important feature of a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Protecting users’ personal data and ensuring a high level of confidentiality will therefore be a priority in our work , so that the digital euro can help maintain trust in payments in the digital age.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">At the ECB we started to explore privacy in digital payments early in our work on a central bank digital currency, and we will continue to do so through further analyses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The results of our technical experimentations are available on our website and summarised in the appendix to my remarks today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Let me emphasise, first of all, that a digital euro would in fact increase privacy in digital payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.75,0)">As a public and independent institution, the ECB has no interest in monetising or even collecting users’ payment data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">A digital euro would therefore allow people to make payments without sharing their data with third parties, other than what is required by regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This differs from private payments, where services are generally offered in exchange for personal data that are then used for commercial purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.79,0)">Privacy is an important prerogative because it influences people’s personal lives and fundamental rights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">It must nonetheless be carefully assessed against other important considerations in the general interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Digital euro payments could guarantee different degrees of privacy , involving different trade-offs with other policy and regulatory objectives such as the need to combat illicit activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.84,0)">Such trade-offs also characterise traditional means of payment, which provide various degrees of privacy, ranging from anonymity for cash payments  to full disclosure for digital transactions that require documentary verification and monitoring of operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.25,0)">In theory, digital euro payments could be anonymous if users’ identities were not verified when they access digital euro services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.63,0)">But this anonymity would provide fertile ground for unlawful activities and could prevent compliance with regulations on anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Anonymity would also prevent limits being imposed on the use of digital euro when necessary – for example to safeguard financial stability and banking intermediation by preventing excessive capital flows or excessive use of the digital euro as a form of investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.43,0)">Even if users have to identify themselves when they first access digital euro services, different degrees of privacy can still be maintained for their payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.58,0)">Certain transactions could be conducted without the payment details being shared with third parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.27,0)">For example, if low-value offline payments were offered, they could be settled between the payer and payee without any data being shared with intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">For electronic and large-value transactions, details should be available to intermediaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">But privacy-enhancing techniques could still ensure a high level of privacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.27,0)">For example, the identity of users could be kept separate from payment data, allowing only financial intelligence units to obtain this information and identify the payer and payee when suspicious activity is detected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Our preliminary experimentation on a digital euro is showing promising results on how technology can be used to protect user privacy without relaxing standards against illicit activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.8,0)">But there could also be cases where transparency of payments would be in the interest of consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.58,0)">For example, it may be necessary to verify a payment after it has been conducted to prove that the transaction took place or if a refund is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In any event, cash would remain available alongside a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Consumers would be able to continue to make anonymous payments with banknotes, if they wish to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">We will take all these factors into consideration as we continue our work and seek the views of stakeholders to find the right balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This includes maintaining a close dialogue on the implications of potentially issuing a digital euro and the framework that would be needed to do so with the legislators and institutions that set the rules on privacy and data protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">A digital euro as a new and secure payment solution The security and usability of the digital euro are also particularly important for prospective users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Electronic payments are becoming increasingly popular, so a digital euro would ensure that sovereign money – a public good that central banks have been offering to citizens for centuries – remains available in the digital era.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">People could have full confidence in both the digital euro and cash, since they are both backed by a credible central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is a unique feature that no private payment scheme can provide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Let me emphasise, once again, that a digital euro would not mean the end of cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It would complement cash, not replace it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">In doing so, a digital euro would contribute to a more diverse payments landscape, giving people greater choice in how they pay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.73,0)">This is also why the digital euro cannot and will not be a tool used to impose negative remuneration on money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">If digital euro holdings were to be remunerated, the remuneration of individuals’ holdings for basic retail use would not go below zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">And effective choices on the design of a digital euro would eliminate risks to financial stability and banking intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">A digital euro would encourage further innovation and digitalisation in retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Supervised intermediaries such as banks and payment institutions could build on the digital euro to offer additional services to end users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Respondents to our consultation expect the digital euro to foster the provision of services that add value, like those covered by the revised Payment Services Directive  and those that could offer the possibility of linking a payment to an external condition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">We are currently focusing on domestic needs in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">But a digital euro could also help to address inefficiencies in cross-currency and cross-border payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">We are working with other major central banks to reap the potential benefits of digital currencies at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">We want to gain a better understanding of the implications of different types of central bank digital currencies, while controlling the possible risks to both domestic and foreign economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The record level of participation in our public consultation and the willingness of citizens and professionals to support a digital euro are encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Their responses show the high expectations that prospective users have for a digital euro and provide valuable input for our work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We are treating this matter with priority and will move as rapidly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">But we also need to take the time to do it right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.37,0)">In the coming months, the ECB’s Governing Council will decide whether to start a formal investigation phase on a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In such a phase, we would carefully analyse possible design options and user requirements as well as the conditions under which financial intermediaries could provide front-end services built on a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We expect this analysis to take around two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">At the end of the investigation, the Governing Council would take a decision on the design and on whether to move to the implementation of user requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This phase, which would take several years, would see the development of integrated services, testing and possible live experimentation of a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Only at the end of this process would the Governing Council be able to decide whether or not to launch a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">We will do our best to ensure that a digital euro meets the needs and expectations of Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But it can only be a common European enterprise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">The alignment of European authorities and institutions, mindful of their respective mandates and independence, will be key if a digital euro is to be accepted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">I am therefore pleased to see that this Committee welcomed our work in its recent resolutions on the ECB Annual Report and the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">As co-legislators and representatives of Europeans, you have a fundamental role to play in the discussions on the framework that would be needed to issue a digital euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This is why I very much appreciate exchanges like the one today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I now look forward to your questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">“Eurosystem report on the public consultation on a digital euro” I have discussed elsewhere the possibility that a digital euro may become too successful – namely if, owing to its strengths of safety and liquidity as a form of central bank money, it were to affect monetary and financial stability – and how this risk can be mitigated through appropriate design choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.62,0)">, “Evolution or revolution?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The impact of a
