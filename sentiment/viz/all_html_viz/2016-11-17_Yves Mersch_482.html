    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.16,0)"> The causes of monetary policy measures and their impact – a review Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Euro Finance Week, FAROS Institutional Investors Forum,Frankfurt, 17 November 2016 “The knowledge of causes produces a knowledge of effects.”   The financial sector is facing an upheaval.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Many of the changes are intentional and positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.03,0)">But certainly not all of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And to understand the individual factors and their interactions better, I’ll be taking a closer look today at the causes of our monetary policy measures and their effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.85,0)">For the European Central Bank’s policy is often referred to as a cause of the current problems in the banking and financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.72,0)">It will quickly become clear that this assumption has its shortcomings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">By focusing on the causes of our actions we can understand more easily how to get back to a normalisation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Causes: Low Natural Interest Rates Let us start with the causes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.98,0)">Why are interest rates so low?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.24,0)">The growth trend has been declining in many mature economies not just since the crisis, but for several decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.82,0)">There are many reasons for this, which I won’t consider here in detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.41,0)">The fact is, the slowdown in growth has led to lower long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.67,0)">In these circumstances, there is a risk of a self-reinforcing downward spiral as these developments do not go unnoticed by economic actors; their expectations are worsening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.38,0)">If a company expects demand to fall, it will be less inclined to make big investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.55,0)">Moreover, ageing societies, which exist in many mature economies, not only have to cope with a shrinking labour force, but they also have to save more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.13,0)">This has led to a savings glut and to a shortage of safe assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.42,0)">So investments are falling and savings are rising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This reluctance to invest is further reinforced when public authorities – with room to manoeuvre as well as existing demand - invest less than is needed even to preserve the capital stock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">This dynamic has led to a reduction in the natural interest rate, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">the real rate of interest in which savings and investments are in equilibrium in an economy operating at its potential, where there is neither upward nor downward pressure on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The natural rate of interest plays an important role in our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">If the key interest rate is below the natural rate, monetary policy has a stimulating effect on the economy as it encourages consumption and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.55,0)">Conversely, when the key rates are above the natural rate, this dampens demand and thus price rises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.95,0)">In the current environment, the ECB has brought the market rate below the level of the natural rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.84,0)">The key rate since March this year has been at zero and the rate on the deposit facility -0.4%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.64,0)">Had we not done this, constant nominal interest rates amid falling inflation rates would have led to higher real interest rates and undermined anaemic growth even more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.57,0)">This would have increased the risk of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">We therefore had to act in order to abide by our price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.33,0)">But we cannot lower our interest rates to an unlimited extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">At a certain level, it becomes more attractive for market participants, for example, to keep cash – despite the associated costs – than to pay negative interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Although this point has not yet been reached, we should bear in mind that reactions to rate cuts further into negative territory do not necessarily follow a linear path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.02,0)">The reactions of people in extreme situations cannot be anticipated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But we can also influence market interest rates in other ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.69,0)">Thus, for example, with our asset purchases we have pushed the yield curve down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">And by offering targeted longer-term refinancing on favourable terms which reward additional lending, we have made it possible for banks to cut their interest rates, a move which has led to increased lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">All our measures in recent years have contributed to the economic recovery in the euro area, although this has been slower than expected and desired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">As I said just now, lending is on the rise, as is demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.38,0)">The unemployment rate in the euro area fell to 10% in the third quarter, and deflation risks have clearly decreased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">We expect inflation to reach 1.6% in 2018, which is very close to our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">However, to bring about a sustainable recovery, additional support will be needed from the political sphere in the shape of structural reforms in various areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Only in this way can we reverse the growth trend over the long term and increase growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.77,0)">Although the return to price stability is taking longer than originally expected and has become more difficult in structural terms, this is no reason to deviate from our goals – whether in relation to our definition of price stability or to its parameters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">A central bank must be reliable, particularly in times of great uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.88,0)">As Abraham Lincoln said: don’t change horses in mid-stream.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Recently, calls to adapt our inflation objective have been made more frequently, especially in the light of rising inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.87,0)">However, growth is still fragile and the inflation path still not sustainable, particularly in view of domestic price pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.35,0)">In this context, how much longer can we continue to talk about even lower rates as being an option?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Considering the importance of credibility for a central bank, we should not delay in making necessary adjustments to our language and actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And yet, we should not be hasty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The fragility of the recovery calls for great caution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Low interest rates and an accommodative policy remain appropriate in the current context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Adapting to new circumstances takes time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.0,0)">Impact of Monetary Policy on Banks For we are aware that our measures have side effects and that these become more pronounced the longer the unconventional measures last.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me emphasise that these measures are temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.22,0)">They are not a permanent part of our active toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">But more on that later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">To mitigate risks as far as possible, we closely monitor the broader repercussions of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We pay special attention to insurance companies and pension funds, and above all to banks, which play a key role in the transmission of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Let’s first of all take a look at the banks: ECB analyses show that our measures are having a positive impact overall on bank profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.15,0)">Over the longer term, however, abnormally low or negative interest rates, together with a very flat yield curve and negative term premia, can have adverse effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.95,0)">Those banks whose business depends heavily on maturity transformation and on deposit-based refinancing are being hit particularly hard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.07,0)">And as it is difficult to pass negative interest rates onto retail customers and as the introduction of fees provides only limited remedy, some of the banks will have to adapt their business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Also, consolidation will continue to be necessary to increase long-term efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.7,0)">We are already seeing now that concerns about the future profitability of banks are affecting their share prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.71,0)">The euro area bank index fell by around 40% between August 2015 and August 2016, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.28,0)">This decline was driven by, among other things, a worsening outlook for the global economy and growing concern about the effects of the low interest rate environment and non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.68,0)">When banks’ share prices fall, their cost of equity increases, which could then reduce the net return on lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.35,0)">This may cause banks to become more conservative in their lending in future and to raise the cost of lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.61,0)">Internal calculations have shown that a decline of around 10% in a bank’s share price reduces corporate lending by around 0.5 percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.25,0)">Together with other factors, such as the still high share of non-performing loans in the balance sheets of some banks as well as regulatory challenges, this could have a negative impact on the economic recovery in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">We are therefore monitoring developments in this area very closely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.11,0)">What we have to avoid, however, is that banks are kept alive artificially, because in the long term this would only damage the economic recovery, as we have already seen in Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.15,0)">Moreover, “palliative medicine for banks” is simply not one of the tasks of a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.72,0)">Some banks have failed since the financial and economic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">We have reacted to this in Europe through measures such as the comprehensive assessment of the banks that the ECB has been responsible for supervising since 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive   establishes a uniform approach for dealing with failed banks in the EU, whereby losses have to be borne first and foremost by owners and creditors, and not by taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.08,0)">Banks that are being wound down are no longer of any use to the real economy: they don’t grant any new loans or take deposits, and their activity in the money market is limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">Such banks can no longer transmit our monetary policy impulses to companies and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">They should then not be drip fed by the central bank but should find other forms of refinancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The introduction of the BRRD and other rules represents considerable progress, and makes our financial system more stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">But we must now apply these rules consistently and avoid exceptions wherever possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.21,0)">The inconsistent application of new rules to existing practices could expose the Eurosystem to unnecessary risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.09,0)">For example, the ECB’s “General Documentation” explicitly states that asset management vehicles   resulting from a resolution-related separation of banks through the application of, for example, the BRRD are not eligible counterparties for ECB refinancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.65,0)">However, entities that do not have the legal status of AMVs but act as wind-down entities as well as those that were created before the implementation of the BRRD are eligible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The various expert committees of the Eurosystem are currently assessing how to align the letter and spirit of our rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.4,0)">Shortage of Safe Assets The current low interest rate environment has not just revealed weaknesses among banks, it has also called into question some traditional practices of insurance companies and pension funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.59,0)">For many insurers in Germany, for example, guaranteed returns have become an issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.11,0)">In the current market environment, it is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve the guaranteed interest rates of 4% that were commonplace in contracts concluded in the mid-1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.6,0)">The German ministry of finance has reduced the guaranteed interest rate for next year from 1.25% to 0.9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Many insurance companies are now increasingly turning to unit-linked products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">In addition, new regulatory requirements are increasing the demand for safe assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.03,0)">German government bonds alone are yielding negative returns on maturities of up to eight years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Against this backdrop, discussions are under way as to what can be done to counter this shortage of safe assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">One suggestion is that market participants create a new kind of safe asset, known as European Safe Bonds , consisting of the senior tranche of a portfolio of existing bonds from different euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The advantage here would be that there would be no joint liability, as there is in the case of other proposals of this kind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.24,0)">It would most likely be difficult to counter the obvious assumption of public opinion that this would be a surreptitious mutualisation of sovereign debt, particularly since this model is very complicated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">This new type of debt security could be at most an interim solution on the way to a true fiscal union in the euro area, allowing for both joint income and federal control over spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">This would be the logical next step in European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Increase potential growth Allow me to conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We have taken a closer look today at the causes of our non-standard monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.08,0)">Weakening global growth and a generally lower natural interest rate lead to low and even negative market rates so that investment and consumption become more attractive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In the medium term we are thereby aiming to get inflation back to a level in line with our mandate to ensure price stability of below, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.83,0)">Without our measures, the euro area economy would probably have slipped back into recession, with an increased risk of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.36,0)">So we had to act, and this prevented things from getting worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Our analysis shows that the measures have been effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The euro area economy is recovering, albeit more slowly than expected, and the risk of deflation has clearly receded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">To ensure that the recovery is sustainable, we must first and foremost address the causes of this global low interest rate environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.04,0)">But monetary policy cannot manage this on its own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Nor are our measures intended to become a permanent feature of the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.21,0)">They were put in place as temporary measures and therefore need to be unwound again as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.56,0)">Given the volume of our purchase programmes, this will take some time, but any long-term use of our asset purchases, for example, would create false incentives for government financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.04,0)">This could ultimately violate the prohibition on the monetary financing of governments and so would not be compatible with our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.59,0)">The economic recovery thus cannot be sustained by monetary policy alone; it also needs support from politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The main objective is to bring about a turnaround in global growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This involves stepping up fiscal policy measures where there is scope and need.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Only then will our monetary policy be able to normalise again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">We also need reforms which lead in particular to greater flexibility in labour and product markets and increase productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Because we have a mandate that says that we have to achieve an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.8,0)">The longer it takes to achieve this objective, the greater the danger that the side effects of our measures will increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">While we are doing our bit to contain the side effects as best we can, the financial industry also has to do its bit by adapting to the new circumstances as far as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.83,0)">In this context it is important that banks are not kept alive artificially by granting them unjustified access to central bank refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">There is a need for clarification on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">It is ultimately in all our interests to do everything we can to return as soon as possible to a path of sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.35,0)">So let’s not waste any time.</span><span
