    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)"> Europe’s frameworks for macro-prudential oversight and economic governance Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the Economic Club of New York, New York, 12 October 2010 Ladies and gentlemen, Stopping over in New York after the IMF meetings has become a tradition I very much cherish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">And it is a particular pleasure for me to speak before the Economic Club of New York today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.58,0)">The last time I spoke here was on 14 October 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.07,0)">At that time, we were in the eye of the storm, with fresh and acute challenges to the global financial system arising by the hour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Today we have to remain permanently alert, while we must address all of the challenges associated with the need to ensure long-term financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We must find a way to create a financial system in which a crisis of this magnitude cannot happen again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">If I were to draw one lesson from the IMF meetings which have just taken place in Washington, it would be that the international community is fully aware of the need to remain particularly vigilant in the present period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">A lot of hard work has been accomplished since the intensification of the crisis in mid-September 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">But a lot remains to be done both as regards the resilience of the global financial system and as regards the rebalancing of domestic and external imbalances at a global level within and between the advanced and the emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">More than ever, resolve is of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">* * * Today, I would like to address two issues: Europe’s new macro-prudential framework and the planned strengthening of Europe’s economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">How Europe is addressing systemic risk Let me start with the macroprudential framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Here, I have three basic messages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">First, I am honoured to speak to you not only in my present capacity as President of the European Central Bank, but also – if I may – in my future capacity as Chairman of the European Systemic Risk Board or ESRB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This new European Union   body, established to provide macro-prudential oversight, will become operational in January.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Second, there is a remarkably strong political consensus in Europe in favour of establishing this new body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The European Parliament approved the legislation supporting the functions of the ESRB with an overwhelmingly large majority of around 80%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Third, the establishment of the ESRB is part of a more comprehensive reform of financial supervision in Europe, which encompasses also the creation of three micro-supervisory European authorities, of a European System of Financial Supervision and an acceleration of structural reforms in the broader financial arena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The breadth and depth of reform in Europe is, in my view, comparable to that recently enacted by the US Congress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Allow me to elaborate on these issues of macroprudential supervision and broader financial regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">Establishing Europe’s macro-prudential framework One of the overarching objectives of the reforms carried out in recent months in Europe and the United States has been the near simultaneous establishment of a new supervisory architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">On both sides of the Atlantic, new legislation has been enacted with the specific aim of overseeing systemic risks in the financial sector as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This represents considerable progress towards regulatory convergence across our two economies, which only a few years ago would have been considered impossible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">In the EU, progress is expected to be achieved at all levels of authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.15,0)">In a third of the Member States, policy-makers have announced or enacted a revision of existing national institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">I consider it significant that these events are taking place in the context of increasing consensus among European authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.22,0)">Only a short while ago it was feared that divided and partial responses by the regulators to the financial crisis had put Europe’s single market at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Today, I observe with satisfaction that institutions acting in different financial markets – from the City of London to the major financial centres of continental Europe – are increasingly speaking a common language.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">At the EU level, reform has involved a comprehensive overhaul of all segments of the financial sector: banks; securities markets; and insurance and occupational pensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">For each of these, the EU has created new European Supervisory Authorities  , which bring together the competent national institutions, and will draw up guidelines and recommendations to ensure that systemic risks arising from individual institutions are adequately addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">These institutions will establish a “single rule book for Europe”, reducing inconsistencies between national regulations and fostering cooperation across Europe’s national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The ESRB for its part will consider financial institutions, markets, products and infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It will have a horizontal focus, across countries, across sectors and across the boundaries between the financial sector and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Understanding interlinkages and spillovers will be at the core of its analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">To fulfil its mandate, the ESRB will perform three main tasks: identifying and prioritising systemic risks; issuing early warnings when significant systemic risks emerge; and making policy recommendations for remedial action in response to the risks it identifies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It will be the ESRB’s responsibility to initiate corrective responses to any identified threats to the EU’s financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.96,0)">The institutional framework remains complex in the United States, but it is, for obvious reasons, even more complex in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">That complexity requires a unique combination of Europe-wide and national competences, which are attributed to different institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Adopting legislation requires, following a proposal by the Commission, both the assent of the Council – a body representing the 27 national governments – and the approval of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Despite this complex decision-making process, Europe has delivered a new framework in around the same time as the United States, a framework which represents a high level of ambition, comparable to the ambition shown by the Dodd-Frank legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The new Europe-wide institutions will also receive substantial new assignments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Many issues are common to Europe and the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">To mention but a few, Europe is discussing provisions to bring the shadow banking sector into the regulatory system, to reduce risks by bringing transactions into transparent and secure financial infrastructures, and to increase consumer protection against the abuse of market power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Months of intense work lie ahead of all of us – in all the entities making up the European System of Financial Supervision – to implement these new regulatory powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The ESRB and the ESAs will need to develop a common set of quantitative and qualitative indicators to identify and measure systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">We will need to understand how to coordinate our functions, in terms of data collection, analysis and communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">All of this will need to be performed within tight deadlines and under pressure to deliver functional arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.01,0)">I understand that our colleagues in Washington face equally demanding assignments with equally tight time frames.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Basel III There is no question that this is the time for action on our financial system – in Europe, in the United States and globally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This leads me to the most global of regulatory frameworks: that established in Basel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Since I have the honour of chairing the Committee of Governors and Heads of Supervision that oversees the work of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, let me say a few words about the “Basel III” reform package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">In my view, this achievement is a cornerstone of the new regulatory system and I would like to pay tribute to all those who have worked on this new framework and succeeded in agreeing on it at a global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Basel III represents a decisive improvement in global capital standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">In this context, I find the Long-term Economic Impact study particularly noteworthy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">It reminds us of the fact that tighter rules can be beneficial for economic welfare, for the simple reason that they help to avoid the major crises triggering abrupt busts, deep recessions and threats of depression that are so damaging to our societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The study suggests in particular that if tighter rules were to lower the yearly probability of a major financial crisis by 1 percent, this could correspond, on average, to an annual output gain of 0.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The study also suggests that the increase in capital requirements, which is part of the Basel III consensus, would indeed significantly reduce the probability of a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Of course, the figures need to be interpreted with caution, but the various models applied in the impact study all suggest that the net social benefits of strengthened regulation can be substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">They also remind us that, in the long run, growth is only meaningful if it is sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Overall, I consider that the agreement strikes a good balance between the objective of decisively strengthening the resilience of the financial sector in this new permanent regime, and at the same time, establishing a transitional period which is sufficiently well crafted not to hamper the ongoing recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Wider financial reform But we are far from done on financial reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.74,0)">Financial reform at the global level is necessarily complex, and achieving it demands resolve and perseverance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">For some comprehensive measures such as the framework to address risks posed by systemically important financial institutions, hard work remains to be done, in particular through the Financial Stability Board, to clarify the concept of systemically important institutions, to investigate the properties of the pertinent tools – additional capital requirements, contingent capital, bail-in instruments, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">– appropriate to increase the loss absorbency of their capital base and to develop firm-specific recovery and resolution plans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This will require continued resolute coordination and dialogue in order to resolve potential conflicts and avoid regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But there is much more to the financial system than the main regulated banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The financial system has grown in scope and dimensions that – since finance is largely an invisible service – are hard to imagine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">There are three figures that I consider it important to note in absolute terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">First, assets of major investment banks have risen from less than USD 2 trillion 20 years ago to USD 22 trillion just before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">That is around 1.5 times US GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Second, hedge funds, which had capital under management of less than USD 100 billion in the early 1990s, were estimated to manage around USD 3 trillion in 2007 – 30-fold increase in 17 years – and are probably of this order of magnitude or larger today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">And finally, the notional value of all categories of derivatives contract has increased by a factor of 20 over the past two decades to stand at more than USD 600 trillion, ten times world GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">These figures give a measure of the structural transformation seen in the global financial markets over the last two decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.55,0)">I consider that we are a long way from fully understanding what those dramatic transformations mean in terms of concentration and the spreading of real risks, in terms of the additional unpredictability of the behaviour of the system as a whole and, therefore, in terms of potential systemic financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.36,0)">There are still many issues on the agendas of the G20 and the FSB that need to be implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">My message on these is straightforward: these agendas should be implemented fully and equally on both sides of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Rigour and a level playing field are the two key terms in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Apart from the issue of systemically important financial institutions, which will figure high up on the upcoming G20 agenda, there are at least six other items where progress needs to be made in the design and/or implementation of reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.78,0)">These are: accounting, ratings, short-selling, compensation, OTC derivatives and alternative investment vehicles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">Accounting, ratings and short-selling practices are all issues that need to be addressed in order to lessen the degree of procyclicality in our financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">On accounting, the G20 summit in London decided that accounting standard setters should reduce the complexity of standards for financial instruments, achieve clarity and consistency in the application of valuation standards internationally, and make significant progress towards a single set of high-quality global standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The announcement made in June 2010 by the IASB and FASB on their convergence strategy is welcome, also because time lags in implementation are considerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.88,0)">If the SEC decides in 2011 to incorporate IFRS into the US domestic reporting system, this would mean that US issuers would potentially not actually report under these rules until 2015 or 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Moreover, even though many attempts are underway, in key accounting areas there are still divergences to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.85,0)">For example, the accounting for financial instruments still diverges considerably between the IASB and FASB on the role of market valuation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">As regards ratings and the G20’s call to engage in decoupling the financial system from external ratings, work is also in progress on both sides of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.62,0)">For short-selling rules and practices, the key shortcoming prior to the crisis – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">the fact that there was no European harmonised framework – will soon be rectified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The Commission has recently made its proposals for a harmonised framework at EU level, which also aims at ensuring consistency with rules prevailing in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.97,0)">Short-termism in the financial system was a key element contributing to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.91,0)">I note that G20 leaders in Toronto in June this year considered implementation on compensation rules and practices – one of the issues underlying short-termism in finance – to be “far from complete”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.19,0)">Indeed, there is still considerable divergence, and a lot of work remains to be done with supervisors and regulators to ensure that compensation practices do not provide incentives for an excessive focus on short-term returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Finally let me stress two issues that concern extending the perimeter of regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">First, the creation of infrastructures for OTC derivatives with the decision to clear all standard derivatives products on central infrastructures by end-2012 at the latest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The Commission proposal for a European framework has been designed so as to aim at a level playing field with the approach in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">If decided on in due course, timely implementation could be assured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Second, the G20 also agreed to extend the perimeter of regulation to systemically important financial intermediaries including alternative investment funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The London G20 summit declaration had stated “to extend regulation and oversight to all systemically important financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This will include, for the first time, systemically important hedge funds.” If there is one area where a global level playing field is absolutely necessary and, in particular, a level playing field on both sides of the Atlantic, it is certainly the sector of alternative investment funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">We are still fully in the process of implementation of financial reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Given the issues at stake and the complexity of finance as well as the global financial system it is not astonishing that implementing this agenda takes time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">What is of the essence, is rigorous and equalised implementation on both sides of the Atlantic, and in the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Strengthening of Europe’s economic governance Let me now turn to the economy and devote the second part of my remarks to Europe’s economic situation and planned reforms in the area of economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Real GDP in the euro area grew by 1%, quarter on quarter, in the second quarter of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Growth has been supported mainly by domestic demand, but also reflects some temporary factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Recent statistical releases and survey evidence generally confirm our expectation of a moderation in the second half of this year in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Therefore, we do not declare victory and we have to remain cautious and prudent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">That being said, the positive but modest underlying momentum of the recovery remains in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Annual inflation in the euro area is currently 1.8%, and we expect inflation to remain moderate in 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Very importantly, we note that inflation expectations over the medium to longer term continue to be firmly anchored in line with our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.35,0)">As all developed economies, Europe has experienced a period of unprecedented turbulence in the last three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.16,0)">As regards the policy response of the executive branches, the EU and the euro area do not take decisions in the same way as a fully fledged political federation like the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.79,0)">Decision making processes are of a different nature and certainly more difficult to decipher by external observers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">That said, the trend over the last three years has been that, when faced with new challenges, the euro area has found solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.63,0)">This was the case in the rescue of the financial sector in 2008, when no systemically important institution failed in Europe and no economic support package was refused by any of the numerous Parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">That was also the case earlier this year in the support for Greece and the establishment of the new stability facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">If I were to draw a tentative lesson from this period, it would be that there is a high level of resolve in the euro area to engage in the decisions and the reforms that are necessary to preserve and consolidate the functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Looking ahead, I see two trends that support this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Prioritising fiscal sustainability The first trend is a general recognition among euro area countries of the need to prioritise fiscal sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">The governments of all euro area countries have committed to fiscal consolidation, although implementation is more advanced in some cases than in others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">In many countries, implementation is already bearing fruit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.05,0)">The IMF currently projects the aggregate fiscal deficit for the euro area next year to be 5.1% of GDP – compared with 9.7% of GDP in the United States, 8.1% of GDP in the United Kingdom and 8.9% of GDP in Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">I am confident that this trend towards fiscal sustainability will continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Euro area countries are demonstrating their commitment to a sustainable path by taking action towards consolidation that is necessary and in their own interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In the euro area generally, the public debate is mostly supportive of the rationale for fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Some have asked why I see fiscal consolidation as a positive trend for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.76,0)">The well known counter-argument is that consolidation risks dampening the prospects for growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">But I believe that fiscal consolidation is not only positive, but essential – for three reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">First, experience suggests that the short-term costs of fiscal consolidation can be contained if the consolidation strategy is effectively designed and includes a comprehensive programme of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.52,0)">Conversely, the long-term costs of not consolidating can be non-linear and unpredictable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.4,0)">Second, the excessive level of fiscal imbalances in many euro area countries puts them in “uncharted waters”, where they can be vulnerable to a rapid deterioration of confidence among firms, households and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This makes consolidation imperative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Third, we are still in uncertain economic times, and it is important that governments retain the capacity to intervene in the face of possible future adverse events, including unforeseeable circumstances such as natural disasters, which can have a significant fiscal dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">This requires sound public finances and specific strategies tailored to national circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">A new framework of economic governance The other trend that is encouraging for the euro area, but where there is still a great deal of hard work before us, is the review of the economic governance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">The European Commission and the Task Force chaired by the President of the European Council, Mr van Rompuy, have been very active in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The Commission has come forward with proposals to strengthen economic governance, published on 29 September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">A number of these proposals go in the right direction and address some important gaps in the existing governance framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">But let me lay out what I believe to be critical points in the implementation of a new framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">What we need is a fundamental strengthening of economic governance in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Economic and Monetary Union rests on two pillars, the economic pillar and the monetary pillar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The monetary pillar is firmly established and the ECB has fully delivered on its mandate to maintain price stability at below and close to 2%, over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.21,0)">Over the first 11½ years of the euro, the average annual inflation rate has been 1.97%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">What is more, inflation expectations are firmly anchored in line with our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">In contrast, the economic pillar of our union remains under construction and there is much work to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">One key area is surveillance of fiscal policies to prevent excessive deficits and unsustainable public debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">It is essential to establish sound procedures to enhance and enforce fiscal surveillance in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">We need shorter deadlines under excessive deficit procedures so that corrective policy action is taken in good time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We need quasi-automaticity in the application of sanctions, based on clearly defined criteria and with less discretion over outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">And we need ambitious targets for the reduction of public debt towards the 60% of GDP ceiling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">The crisis has also demonstrated the importance of broader surveillance of macroeconomic policies in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Given the large spillovers from the macroeconomic policies of one country to other members of the single currency, much needs to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I am in favour of the creation of an early warning system to identify unsustainable policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">A number of the Commission’s proposals point in this direction, but we need to go further still.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The framework for the assessment of macroeconomic imbalances within the euro area should focus primarily on countries with vulnerabilities, losses in competitiveness and high debt levels, as these countries face the greatest sustainability challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The framework should also use a limited number of indicators to ensure clarity and consistency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.54,0)">When the indicators reveal potential problems, they should automatically trigger an in-depth analysis of the country concerned, including missions by the Commission in liaison with the ECB and public scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">This process should be backed up by graduated sanctions, which kick in at an early stage, to reinforce compliance with recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The effectiveness of these enhancements to the governance framework will in part be determined by the quality and independence of the economic analysis that underpins them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Without reliable statistical data, interpreted and acted on by independent arbiters, we cannot be certain that the governance framework will provide the quantum leap forward that is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">It is therefore extremely important that the Commission services charged with conducting macroeconomic and fiscal surveillance for the euro area be sufficiently independent, ideally supported by a body of “wise persons” providing external assessments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">We are now at a stage where we need to remain bold and enact those reforms that we envisaged when the crisis was at its deepest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It was then that we witnessed the clearest manifestation of risks and our judgement was sharpest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.19,0)">It would be a big mistake if, with gradually improving conditions, we fell back into accepting the status quo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">I therefore call on all parties to remain as bold in their reforms as they were when we were in the eye of the storm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Concluding remarks Let me say in conclusion that I consider it essential to preserve, consolidate and reinforce the remarkable unity demonstrated by the international community in the crisis period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">We were able to agree on the following major points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">First, there was the consensus on the need to increase participation in the informal global governance framework to include all systemic emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This was illustrated by the G7 passing the baton to the G20 as the primary forum for global economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Second, there was consensus – spanning both emerging and advanced economies – in confirming, at the very moment the crisis was unfolding, that market economy rules are the most effective and efficient means to create prosperous economies and societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Third, there was consensus on working together to reinforce rules, regulations and standards in the financial sector with a view to decisively strengthening its resilience and improving the coordination of fiscal and structural policies within a framework for strong, stable and sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.09,0)">This was no time for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The unity of the international community made a difference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">We avoided a depression, and the recovery began in the second half of 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.19,0)">This is still no time for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">What we need today is not “wars” of any kind, but a strong and renewed commitment to confident and resolute cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Together we must say “no” to protectionism and “no” to beggar-thy-neighbour policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The international community can and must continue to make a difference by being united and showing a strong sense of medium and long-term direction.</span>
