    <span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)"> Macroprudential policy in Europe: ensuring financial stability in a banking union Keynote speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the Financial Stability Conference, Berlin, 28 October 2015 Summary When the business cycle and the financial cycles are disconnected, monetary policy must remain anchored to its goal of ensuring price stability in the markets of goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.06,0)">It cannot address instability in asset markets or broader financial stability risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.5,0)">This is the task of macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Its objective is to contain systemic risk in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The role of macroprudential policy is all the more relevant in a monetary union, where economic and financial conditions may significantly differ across member states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">With its granular and targeted instruments, macroprudential policy provides the most appropriate tool for staving off financial stability risks in the specific areas where they arise, being it at the level of a country, a sector or a financial institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">An effective conduct of macroprudential policy can therefore help monetary policy to remain focussed on fulfilling its price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The last two years have shown that macroprudential policy in Europe is already active.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The implemented national macroprudential policies since the start of the CRR/CRD IV are especially focussed on structurally strengthening the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In addition, the adoption of borrower-based instruments, such as loan-to-value  , loan-to-income   or debt service-to-income   by national authorities indicates that they are useful instruments in the European environment to curtail excessive credit and house price growth by acting directly on borrower’s conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Going forward, we need to complete the macroprudential toolkit in the hands of European authorities to enhance consistency and policy co-ordination and to enable them to address financial stability risks emerging outside the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">This will be a key step to accompany further European market integration and the creation of a true Capital Markets Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.44,0)">Ladies and Gentlemen, For more than two years now annual euro area HICP inflation has been below 2%, and for some time significantly so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.5,0)">Together with subdued economic growth, the low inflation rates reflect a continued sluggish recovery in the aftermath of the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.44,0)">Numerous reasons can be considered as root causes for this dismal performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.87,0)">Next to recent declines in oil prices, the combination of low inflation and low growth essentially points to a lack of demand holding back the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.29,0)">There are several reasons why excessively low inflation generates relevant risks for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">First, with monetary policy rates at their lower bound, lower inflation rates imply higher real interest rates; in particular the real interest rate may end up above the equilibrium value needed to match savings and investment at the full employment level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.62,0)">Second, very low inflation may lead to an un-anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.41,0)">This would imply second-round effects on price and wage setting protracting the subdued price developments into the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.48,0)">Third, low inflation increases the debt burden of borrowers, obstructing the needed balance sheet adjustment of highly indebted households, firms and governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.15,0)">Fourth, should a generalised deflation pressure prevail, nominal rigidities in the economy, and particularly in labour markets, could inhibit the needed relative price adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Finally, all empirical studies show that there is a positive measurement bias in the measurement of price developments, which implies that a zero inflation rate would mask actually declining prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">For all these reasons the ECB has decided a quantitative objective with an inflation rate for the euro area of below but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">This objective guarantees an appropriate buffer to counter the above-mentioned drawbacks of very low inflation or even deflationary tendencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">In order to bring inflation rates closer to the stated objective of price stability over the medium-term, and in order to support the aggregate recovery our monetary policy is continuing its accommodative stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Our main policy rates will stay low for a prolonged period of time, in line with our forward guidance and the asset purchase programmes will keep our balance sheet expanding until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.75,0)">Moreover, in the past months, downside risks to the global economy have increased, due notably to the increasing weakness in emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">As indicated at last week’s Governing Council meeting, the ECB is closely monitoring these developments and stands ready to act with all available instruments to deliver on its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.32,0)">How does this situation, and in particular the monetary policy stance, relate to the situation in financial markets and the risks to financial stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.13,0)">Are we creating, as some observers claim, the conditions for new instability going forward?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">And, should our monetary policy stance change route to counter those risks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">To answer these questions let me start by underlining that the ECB action is the necessary response to very serious macroeconomic shocks and challenges to our economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.8,0)">If these are left unaddressed they bear the risk in further disruptive developments - ultimately also bringing instability in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Our policy has been key to greatly improve credit conditions for households and firms over the past two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Evidence also clearly indicates that the recovery in domestic demand is becoming more broadly based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">By creating the conditions for price stability and a sustained recovery, the ECB is also providing a fundamental contribution to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.39,0)">More generally, it would be a mistake to divert monetary policy from its objective of maintaining price stability to more directly address asset price misalignments and financial stability risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.58,0)">The business cycle and the financial cycle are not necessarily synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.07,0)">The financial cycle tends to have larger amplitude and lower frequency than the normal business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.28,0)">This implies that long periods of “disconnect” between the two cycles can materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In the past, the separation between the two was not considered likely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">In particular, it was thought that price stability in the market of goods and services would be sufficient to guarantee financial stability in the market for assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The present situation, and the period of the so-called Great Moderation ahead of the crisis, should be sufficient to dispel such traditional concepts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.53,0)">Before the crisis, while inflation was low and stable, significant financial imbalances were building up as the relatively deregulated financial system engineered a credit boom and a highly risky leverage situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.66,0)">Likewise, at present, the very low inflation and subdued growth environment is accompanied by some froth in financial asset markets resulting from “search for yield” in an environment of low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.66,0)">This “disconnect” between the financial and the business cycle creates a dilemma to traditional macro-economic policy and especially to monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.35,0)">The main remit of monetary policy refers to the relevant variables of the business cycle: inflation in the market of goods and services and the level of real economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Real economic activity is directly considered by central banks with a dual mandate, like the U.S. Fed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It is considered indirectly by central banks with a hierarchical mandate, like the one of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.42,0)">More generally, though, no central bank has objectives explicitly referred to asset prices in its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.5,0)">There are different reasons why monetary policy cannot, and should not, be used to deal with financial instability in asset markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.5,0)">One relates to the fact that the monetary policy objective may require an expansionary stance when asset markets would require restrictive measures, reflecting different positions in the business and financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.8,0)">A second argument questions whether monetary policy, through its main policy instrument – the short term interest rates - can effectively target asset market prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.34,0)">Finally, monetary policy affects all sectors simultaneously and is therefore a too blunt or even an ineffective tool to cope with specific imbalances in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">All these reasons imply that monetary policy needs to be complemented by an additional policy, with a differentiated set of instruments, in order to ensure financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This is the remit of macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Indeed, after the crisis, there has been a trend to attribute an explicit goal of financial stability to central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In order to fulfil this objective, central banks have to be entrusted with a new set of granular tools of a macroprudential nature that can be applied to the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Macroprudential policy has two main objectives: enhancing the resilience of financial institutions and the whole financial system and, second, smoothening the financial cycle as captured by the fluctuations in credit, leverage and asset prices which may else lead to boom-bust episodes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The instruments available for macroprudential policy include most of the micro-supervision instruments related to capital and liquidity requirements when applied to counter systemic risks related.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.8,0)">But they extend also to other categories, like limits to loan-to-value ratios in housing credit, counter-cyclical capital buffers, global leverage ratios, or haircuts and margin requirements in securities’ transactions or clearing activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Macroprudential policy is essential in any economy to complement monetary policy as the business and financial cycles are not synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is all the more important in a monetary union, where economic and financial conditions across member states can differ significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">With more granular and targeted instruments, macroprudential policy can address financial stability risks in the specific areas where they arise, being it at the level of a country, a sector or a financial institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In a nutshell, macroprudential policy can unburden monetary policy to fulfil its price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In Europe, the macroprudential policy framework is in place since the adoption of the CRR/CRDIV legislative package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">With the start of the SSM in November last year, the ECB received macroprudential powers, which it shares with national authorities in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The toolkit is centered on the banking system and includes capital- and liquidity-based measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Some of the instruments, notably the countercyclical capital buffer, can be used to contain the pro-cyclicality inherent in financial developments at the root of the damaging boom and bust episodes we have experienced in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">The current macroprudential assessment and action in the euro area While monetary policy needs to continue its course to fulfil its price stability mandate and sustain the recovery, it is key for macroprudential policy to assess the consequences that the globally low interest rate environment and ample liquidity may have for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The goal of our current monetary policy stance is to incentivise economic risk taking, in the form of better financing conditions for households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.83,0)">We are, of course, very much aware that side effects are also possible, in particular in the form of excessive asset valuations or excessive risk-taking by market operators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.93,0)">For example, the ECB’s asset purchase programme directly affects the price of purchased bonds and the portfolio rebalancing effects indirectly influence also many other asset markets, such as investment grade bonds, equities, real estate or foreign assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We are following these developments very closely, notably in relation to risks posed by asset valuations and the search for yield phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.09,0)">Our assessment at present is that there is no sign of a general asset market overvaluation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Euro area equity prices are still recovering from the summer turmoil.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.04,0)">Prior to that, they had been fairly valued with a price-earnings ratio well below the values seen in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In the corporate bond markets, the increase in credit risk premia observed in the past few months has eased overvaluation concerns somewhat, with corporate spreads moving closer to their long-run averages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.2,0)">When examining excess bond premia, standard valuation models for euro area non-financial corporations point to fairly valued, or even slightly under-priced, corporate bond market valuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Term premia in sovereign bond markets are somewhat stretched, but this is a direct and desired consequence of the monetary policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As for the real estate market, the situation is quite differentiated across member states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">There are growing signs that the recovery in property prices is becoming more broad-based across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">In general, there is no evidence of generalised overvaluations, although some local developments warrant close monitoring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.17,0)">This situation in euro area asset markets couples with a still subdued credit cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.6,0)">While credit to the real economy is certainly recovering, all countries experience cyclical real credit growth rates below their long-term average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.48,0)">Estimates of the credit-to-GDP gap, a measure of the deviation of credit from its longer run norm are negative for nearly all euro area countries and are below 10% in most euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In other words, we are still far away from a situation of excessive credit growth and asset price misalignments – very different from a credit-driven asset price boom, which has preceded many financial crises of the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The implication of this state of affairs is that at the moment, we do not see a need to implement broadly based area-wide countercyclical macroprudential policies, such as the countercyclical capital buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is not to say, however, that selective measures to tackle risks emerging in specific parts of the financial system should not be taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Indeed, dozens of actions in the macroprudential field have already been taken by euro area countries, to increase the resilience of the banking system and to prevent the emergence of possible imbalances, in particular in the real estate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Within the first category — to raise resilience — macroprudential action has especially contributed to strengthening bank capital positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Capital ratios of significant banking groups have already markedly increased from a median common equity Tier 1   capital ratio of 7% in 2008 to 12.8% at the end of 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This strengthening has been spurred by the preparations for the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the conduct of the Asset Quality Review last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In addition, a number of macroprudential authorities in the euro area have activated three types of capital buffers: the buffer for global systemically important institutions  , the one for other systemically important institutions   and the systemic risk buffer  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Such buffers are intended to address the problems stemming from too-big-to-fail institutions, large, concentrated and interconnected banking sectors, as well as specific structural risks deriving for instance from exposures to areas affected by geopolitical tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">As for the G-SII buffers, seven globally systemic banks from four euro area countries have been identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">National authorities have overall also identified thirteen other systemically important banks building on the EBA guidelines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These are five for Slovakia, four for the Netherlands and four for Finland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Other countries will announce their global and other systemically important banks soon and capital buffers will gradually be phased in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In addition, Estonia and the Netherlands have already adopted systemic risk buffers to counter those risks emerging from groups of banks with similar business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">These three capital buffers address risks linked to the structural features of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">They raise resilience and are applied in a static way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Countercyclical capital buffers and dynamic loan provisioning, instead, can address cyclical features by increasing capital requirements when systemic risks build up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.54,0)">Until now, no SSM country has adopted positive countercyclical capital buffers given the prevailing subdued position in the credit cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">But should stronger credit growth imply excessive risk-taking, the cyclical buffers are fully implementable in all SSM countries starting in 2016 to mitigate the upturn of a credit-driven financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In the second category, covering measures to address potential imbalances in the real estate sector, there have also been a number of initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">As mentioned, valuation metrics suggest that prices are generally still in line with fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.07,0)">Estimates for the euro area as a whole show that residential property prices are slightly below the average valuations of the last 20 years; commercial real estate prices, instead, display some signs of overvaluation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.73,0)">But dispersion is substantial around these average estimates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Given the indirect transmission of capital-based measures to lending conditions, authorities are relying on borrower-based instruments, such as loan-to-value  , loan-to-income   or debt service-to-income   to address risk-taking and overvaluation more specifically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.45,0)">Such instruments act more directly on borrower’s conditions to curtail excessive credit growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Eight SSM countries have already adopted these instruments, especially to counter potential risks of low interest rates for the real estate market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">What is more, in order to exploit complementarities between three individual borrower-based measures, the authorities in Estonia and Lithuania have implemented jointly explicit limits on loan-to-value ratios, income-based ratios and loan maturity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The initial evidence indicates that these policies can be highly effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.25,0)">For example in the case of Ireland, where at the beginning of 2015 the Central Bank introduced a loan-to-value limit of 80% on principal dwelling houses and a limit on loan-to-income of 3.5 times relative to gross income, house prices have been decelerating from very high rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.02,0)">In Belgium, a slowdown in house price growth has also been observed after the introduction of add-ons in risk weights for mortgage lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">It is important that appropriate tools are available for authorities to contain the build-up of potential imbalances in real estate markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In this respect, we very much welcome the recommendation by the German Financial Stability Committee in June to create minimum standards for residential real-estate loans such as minimum capital requirements and minimum debt repayment rates by the end of March 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">At the same time, we concur with the Committee’s assessment that there are no signs to use them at the current stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Still, we encourage further work on the legislation for loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios to be included it in the macroprudential toolkit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Other countries have also prepared prudential measures, especially to strengthen the regulatory toolkit in a low interest rate environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">These measures are strongly driven by systemic risk considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">For example, authorities in Ireland, Lithuania, Slovakia and Germany are now recommending interest rate sensitivity tests for newly contracted mortgages in order to raise the resilience of mortgage borrowing to interest rate risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.76,0)">The low interest rate environment has led some countries to recommend caps on bank deposit rates or caps on guaranteed benefit schemes of insurance contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">These are important to safeguard the resilience of the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">The National Bank in Belgium also expects that pay-outs to bank and insurance shareholders are limited when deemed necessary to enhance their solvency position and to sustain their long-term resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These examples show that macroprudential considerations lead to policy decisions through a broad range of instruments and with varying legal powers ranging from moral suasion over recommendations to provisions with clear sanctions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.64,0)">It is of course too early to fully assess these experiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Macroprudential policy in the euro area is still in its infancy and we need to fully understand the effects and the interactions among the different instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Substantial analytical and empirical work is needed to place the macroprudential authorities into a position to use the available instruments in the most effective way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">At the same time, it is fair to say that macroprudential policies are already contributing to creating a safer financial environment in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Going forward, macroprudential policy can represent a key building block for high and sustainable economic growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">In order to reap all benefits of an effective macroprudential policy, however, the macroprudential policy framework needs to be completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Completing the macroprudential toolkit There are at least two important directions to follow to complete the macroprudential toolkit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">First, we need to further enhance the European authorities’ ability to intervene in a timely and efficient manner with macroprudential action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">This entails, first of all, to strengthen the co-ordination role of central authorities to ensure full consistency and to account for possible spillover effects of macroprudential policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">It also requires expanding the toolkit at the EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.61,0)">Some instruments that are available for national macroprudential authorities are not present in the CRR/CRD IV and are thus not part of the ECB macroprudential toolkit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">They are primarily borrower-based measures, such as caps on LTV, LTI or DSTI, which have however proven to be rather effective, and should be included as in the revised CRR/CRDIV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Specific limits on exposures to shadow banks should be considered and the scope of sectoral risk weights   could be extended to other exposure classes, so that macroprudential authorities can address risks emerging in specific sectors in a targeted manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Furthermore, a time-varying dimension for both the leverage ratio   and the net stable funding ratio   – that will become part of the toolkit as soon as introduced – could be considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Finally, it is necessary to simplify the current cumbersome notification and approval procedures in order to allow macroprudential authorities to act in a flexible and timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Another issue relates to the need to expand our macroprudential toolkit beyond the banking sector to also cover risks among non-banks and the financial markets as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In recent years, financial activity and the financing of the economy has been increasingly shifting to financial institutions beyond banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">For example, the investment fund sector has been growing strongly, both because of surging inflows and rising asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">As of the first quarter of this year, investment funds in the euro area are providing €1.3 trillion in credit to financial firms, €1 trillion to governments, and more than €300 billion to non-financial firms in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">They also invested in equities and other non-financial assets, including real estate, both within the euro area and outside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The non-euro area assets make up about 40% of investment funds balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In short, investment funds have an increasingly important role in funding the euro area domestic economy and for channelling investments abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">I see great benefits in broadening the funding base of the European economy, where market-based financing complements the traditional banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Market-based financing can be seen as a spare-tire which helps satisfy demands for financing of the real economy, especially in times of sizeable deleveraging pressures in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Moreover, by spreading financial risk outside the banking sector and on a larger number of market participants, such development may also be seen as reinforcing the overall resilience of the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The Capital Markets Union initiative in the EU will help promote these valuable functions of market-based financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">However, such a process also entails a transference of risk from more regulated to less regulated institutions and activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.17,0)">Indeed, part of the shifting of activities outside the banking sector is likely stemming from a reaction to the regulatory action on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To avoid that the increase in market-based financing becomes a serious source of systemic risk, macroprudential regulation also needs to apply to the non-banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The need for macroprudential regulation of certain financial market activities becomes clear if we consider that banks and non-banks are closely tied through market-based intermediation activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These include a broad array of services related to securitisation transactions, securities financing transactions, repos, collateral management and derivatives – allowing for risk transformation and exchange via swaps and other instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.46,0)">These activities can be conducted by regulated banks or by other less regulated institutions, but most of these activities escape the monetary statistics and the flow-of-funds accounts – they can, therefore, hardly be monitored, which is why they are called shadow banking activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But risks of regulatory arbitrage are sizeable, as many of the activities can be conducted by different types of institutions subject to diverse regulatory regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Additionally, the more effective we are in using macroprudential tools for banks, the more likely activities spill over into the less regulated sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.6,0)">Past experience has indeed shown that financial conditions can easily spill-over from one part of the financial system to the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">To give an example, before the global crisis, the markets for money-like claims were boosted by the emergence of very sizeable cash pools as these could possibly not find safety in banks’ insured deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">According to the academic literature, collateral markets, such as repo and derivative margins, played a decisive role in these developments  , where the role of bankruptcy privileges is noted as a key feature of the secured funding model  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.83,0)">Such markets can be of concern from a macroprudential perspective, especially if they are contributing to the financial cycle or if they create additional risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.35,0)">Recent analytical studies – largely based on empirical studies on US markets –suggest that repo and securities lending markets were indeed inherently procyclical and may have amplified liquidity problems during the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.34,0)">Macroprudential regulation must therefore not stop at the boundary of banks, as it would risk that exuberant financial conditions or potential distress easily spill over from one market to the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Instead, macroprudential policy should have a complete toolkit available to adjust prudential requirements in a countercyclical manner across a broad range of financing activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">In this respect, the macroprudential framework needs to evolve in three key aspects to effectively reach beyond the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">First, we need to close remaining data gaps and to broaden the information-base of financial market activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.6,0)">Without detailed information, macroprudential policy cannot be enforced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.04,0)">One of the challenges faced is to consolidate and aggregate data from various sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.87,0)">Furthermore, opacity remains a concern for statistics on aggregate liquidity or leverage of investment funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.38,0)">An aspect of particular concern refers to the measurement of synthetic leverage build-up mostly with over-the-counter-derivatives, data which are not collected systematically or in a harmonised fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Second, we need to develop tools targeting liquidity in non-bank financial institutions and ensure that leverage remains within acceptable limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.82,0)">Asset-liability structures vary substantially across non-bank institutions, so a one-size-fits-all approach is clearly not appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.05,0)">Take the example of open-ended investment funds, in which case equity is redeemable at short notice, creating the possibility of disturbing liquidity pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">If we are to deploy macroprudential tools effectively beyond the banking sector, the competent supervisors need a clearer picture of the resilience of individual institutions and the entire financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">To assess resilience, guided stress-tests at institutional and system level need to be developed, in line with recommendations by the FSB   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Third, we need to tailor specific rules and tools for financing activities at the juncture between banking and non-bank financial intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">To dampen procyclicality in securities financing and derivatives markets, macroprudential authorities should be given the power to change haircuts at transaction level in a time-varying manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">At the same time, Central Counterparties need to have their own margining policies in place, that adequately address the risks stemming from specific trading behaviours and counterparty risk in times of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">For all the above-mentioned aspects I am confident that the review of the EU macroprudential framework, recently announced by the Commission, will provide the opportunity for a significant enhancement of the regulatory context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">A complete and well-functioning macroprudential policy framework is essential for future integration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">It can complement the action of the single monetary policy and contribute to high and sustainable economic growth in the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Recent experience shows that macroprudential policy in the euro area is already active.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Going forward, we need to complete the toolkit in the hands of European authorities to enhance coordination, reduce spill-overs and to prepare for the Capital Markets Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Macroprudential policies are crucial to cope with systemic risk and endogenous cycles in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">They are particularly important in the euro area at the current juncture, as the global environment of low interest rates and the rise in shadow banking activities exposes the financial sector to increased risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Macroprudential and monetary policy rely on separate tools and aim at achieving different objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Yet, they need to be co-ordinated, which is a non-trivial task given that financial and business cycles can be de-synchronised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For these reasons, as I have already highlighted, appropriate macroprudential policy instruments must be at the disposal of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">If effective macroprudential measures are not made available, advanced economies will be more vulnerable to financial crises that could be avoided or mitigated if only we would heed to the lessons of recent history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Thank you for your attention    Issing  , “Background Studies
