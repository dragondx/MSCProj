    <span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)"> Eurosystem: new challenges for old missions Inaugural Lecture by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, on the occasion of his appointment as honorary Professor of Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität, Frankfurt am Main, 15 April 1999 Table of contents Introduction Policy missions New challenges Making the eurosystem a central bank Dealing with the European unemployment Managing financial transformations Coping with a lack of political union Conclusion INTRODUCTION I participate in this Dies Academicus, at the University that carries the name of Goethe, in the town of Frankfurt, in the first year of the euro, with thoughts and emotions that are hard to conceal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.95,0)">In my early youth, at the time of the decisions that determine one's life, the dearest of my Gymnasium teachers told me: "You have to resolve, in order to decide your future, the dilemma of what interests you most: whether to understand or to change the world."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">My choice has been Economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And, the subject of economics being human action, I early discounted that the call for action would prevail, in my motivations, over the enquiring spirit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.92,0)">I did not expect how strongly that dilemma would continue to accompany my life.More importantly, I did not understand, at the time, how much acting and enquiring are complementary ways of being in the world and searching for truth, as Goethe's work and life so profoundly witness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.45,0)">Science changes reality; practical activity not supported by reflection and analysis is ineffective and even harmful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">If I now live in Frankfurt and am here today it is because most of my professional life was spent in an institution - the Banca d'Italia - where eminent persons like Guido Carli, Paolo Baffi and Carlo Azeglio Ciampi allowed the dilemma of my early years being kept somewhat unresolved and favoured independent analysis as a complement of practical activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">They also shared and encouraged the combination of enquiry and action that helped the euro to become a reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">To them I therefore dedicate this lecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Academia is the place where teaching and enquiring reinforce each other by going hand in hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It originates from Socrates' precept that "the wisest recognises that he is in truth of no account in respect to wisdom".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Teaching is assertive, enquiring interrogative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.96,0)">One is based on the presumption that we have answers to transmit; the other is based on the modesty imposed by unresolved questions The mode of the following remarks will be the interrogative, rather than the assertive one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Not only because presumption is certainly not my état d'esprit today, but, more importantly, because the theme of this lecture - the new challenges posed by the advent of the euro - has a distinctly intellectual dimension, not only a practical one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The success of EMU will largely depend on the ability to identify new problems at an early stage and to analyse them without prejudice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">While the mission entrusted to central bankers is not new, the challenges in the years to come may indeed differ from those of the last few decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">They may be "new" either because they have not been experienced before, or because they have acquired a new dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In reviewing what I consider to be, for the Eurosystem, the most important of such challenges, I shall use the academic privilege of taking a free and forward-looking perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">My point of view will, therefore, not necessarily coincide with that of my institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Moreover, I shall not be objective, because I shall mainly draw on the intellectual and practical experiences that have constituted my professional life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.07,0)">POLICY MISSIONS Policy missions have not been altered by the start of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">They correspond to aspects of the public interest that were not redefined, and did not need a redefinition, because of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the field of central banking the public interest is to provide economic activity with a medium of exchange that preserves its value over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">In the broader field of economic policy - of which monetary policy is part - the public interest is, to use words from the Maastricht Treaty that can be similarly found in most national constitutions and legislation, "to promote economic and social progress which is balanced and sustainable"  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In the field of European integration, the mission is that of "creating an ever closer union among the people of Europe, in which decisions are taken as closely as possible to the citizen"  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Finally, in the field of international relations the public interest is to "maintain international peace and security"   as well as to "contribute to the promotion and maintenance of high level of employment and real income"  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The formulation of these policy missions has taken shape over the course of this century, or even earlier, on the basis of experience, scholarly investigation, political debate and action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">There would be no consensus about the primary mission of the central bank if countries had not experienced first hyperinflation and then successful monetary management by a stability-oriented and independent central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Social progress and economic growth would not be on the agenda of governments without the labour movement and the Great Depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We would not have the EU Treaties and the Charter of the UN without the tragedy of two World Wars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Economists have explored the scope for economic policy action, and the limits thereof, in the monetary, fiscal and regulatory fields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.87,0)">Without thirty years of academic debate about the role of monetary policy, the EMU Treaty and the Statute of the ESCB/ECB would not have been written the way they were.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The subordination of economic policies to the principle of "an open market economy with free competition" would not have been explicitly inserted in the Maastricht Treaty   had those principles not gained recognition in the community of scholars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Central bankers   have prepared the blueprint for the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">International and constitutional lawyers have elaborated the legal concepts and studied the procedures to carry out the policy missions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">They have built that legal monument that is the Rome/Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Citizens and politicians have discussed, promoted and implemented the whole process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Different policies carry different degrees of compulsion and effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.25,0)">In general, instruments are more strongly framed when they are entrusted to institutions whose area of jurisdiction coincides with that of the nation state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Strongly framed instruments, however, do not necessarily produce strong results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.49,0)">Tough regulation against air pollution adopted only by a small country is less effective, for that same country, than softer regulation adopted by a larger group of countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The economic literature about externalities, or that about optimal currency areas, are seminal examples of the contribution economic research can make in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the following I shall focus on the mission of the central banker, because this is the function assigned to me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">I am convinced, however, that the missions I mentioned are fundamentally complementary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.91,0)">Different assignments are part of an orderly division of labour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In a democratic and market-oriented environment not only citizens, but also officials, can consider the aims of the various policy bodies and charters - national and international - to which they refer as forming a consistent configuration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I regard this as a special privilege of the time and space in which I have lived so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">NEW CHALLENGES In the last thirty years central bankers have fought for two objectives: the recognition of the primacy of price stability for monetary policy, and the independence of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.86,0)">This has been the period in which the combination of political democracy and fiduciary currency made the governance of money particularly difficult in many countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The intellectual recognition, then the political acceptance and finally the actual implementation of a monetary constitution based on price stability and central bank independence have required a long process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The academic profession has contributed to it in a powerful way, from Irving Fisher to Don Patinkin to Robert Lucas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Even those who have denied the need of having a central bank, like Milton Friedman and Friedrich A. von Hayek, have in the end contributed to clarify its role and function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">No less persuasive have been the arguments of experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">In a positive sense, the economic success of the country - Germany - where the two elements had been introduced at an early stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.46,0)">In a negative sense, the social evil of high and prolonged inflation suffered by many other countries, including my own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In legal and institutional terms, the result of this long fight has been engraved in the Treaty of Maastricht.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The Treaty represents the strongest monetary constitution ever written, not only because of its substance, but also because the procedure to amend it is more difficult than that required for the charter of any existing central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Largely induced by Maastricht and EMU is also the independent status of national central banks in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We should indeed not forget that, until recently, key decisions in the field of monetary policy were still in the hands of the Treasury in such countries as the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Spain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The Maastricht process has been the catalyst for monetary reforms central bankers had advocated for years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Partly, but not exclusively, because of this process, the conditions under which the single currency has come to life differ from those prevailing in the past years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Prices have for some time now shown the highest degree of stability seen for more than thirty years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Most countries have made significant progress towards fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">The consensus on sound principles of budgetary and monetary management is broader and stronger, among both politicians and ordinary people, than in any other period the present generation can remember.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Few dispute in an open way the now widely used expression "culture of stability".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.0,0)">However, when in 1981 it was decided to save the last specimen of the smallpox virus in a laboratory for the sake of documentation, health had not ceased to be in danger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Similarly, none of these achievements can be considered as permanent and central bankers should primarily strive to preserve them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">To this end, detecting new challenges at an early stage is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.43,0)">The question is: where do the problems come from?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.52,0)">What are the circumstances under which the "old mission" will have to be accomplished in the coming years?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.58,0)">What threatens our health besides smallpox?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">MAKING THE EUROSYSTEM A CENTRAL BANK The first challenge consists in making the Eurosystem a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.24,0)">It may seem simple, but is not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me start my explanation from the two key words of this proposition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Eurosystem is the word chosen by the ECB to indicate the "ECB+11 participating national central banks", i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.2,0)">the central bank of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.25,0)">The Treaty has no name for this key entity, while it refers extensively to the ESCB   formed by the ECB and the 15 European national central banks).</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, as long as there are "out" countries, the ESCB in its full composition will remain a scarcely relevant entity because it neither refers to a single currency area nor has any policy competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.04,0)">Instead, the word Eurosystem indicates clearly the articulated entity which is for the euro what the Federal Reserve System is for the dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.94,0)">Central bank is the institution in charge of the public interests associated with the currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It originates fromfundamental changes in the technology of payments: the adoption of banknotes, cheques and giros, and their final disconnection from gold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These changes have shaped the two other functions that most central banks have derived from the original payment system function: monetary policy and banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Man-made money made monetary policy possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.93,0)">Commercial bank money made banking supervision necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.51,0)">These three functions have most often been entrusted to the same institution because they are inextricably linked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.11,0)">Just as money has the interrelated roles of means of payment, unit of account and store of value, so central banking has a triadic function that refers to the three roles of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Operating and supervising the payment system refers to money as a means of payment; ensuring price stability refers to money as a unit of account and a store of value; pursuing the stability of banks refers to money as a means of payment and a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The function remains triadic   even where prudential control is entrusted to a separate agency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.66,0)">I am referring to the special "supervision" any central bank has over its banking community, necessitated by the fact that banks are the primary creators of money, providers of payment services, managers of the stock of savings and counterparties of central bank operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In performing its triadic function the central bank exerts operational and regulatory powers, interacts with other public authorities and the financial community, entertains relations with other central banks, participates in international debates and negotiations about monetary and financial matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In all these activities it pursues and represents the public interest of a sound currency; all are instrumental to that interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">From the point of view of the perceptions of people and markets all such activities refer to that same public good that we call confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">For the Eurosystem the challenge is to rise to a full central banking role as just defined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.09,0)">It is necessary because of the links that bind the various functions of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.72,0)">The Eurosystem would find it hard to play effectively its most delicate role - the pursuit of a stable currency or, as the German Constitution puts it, "die Währung zu sichern" - if it appeared as an inexplicable exception to the classic paradigm of a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.17,0)">The public, the markets, the international institutions and fora would not understand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.89,0)">But it is also difficult, because the steps to take are multiple and complex from both a conceptual and a practical point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.9,0)">Moreover, they cannot all be taken at once.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me briefly explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In the articulation of any federal constitution   the central bank undoubtedly belongs to the level of the "federation", or Bund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.04,0)">The fact that important activities are conducted by "local" components of the system   is an organisational feature that does not impinge upon the constitutional position of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.8,0)">The same happens within Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The Eurosystem is the central bank of the euro area, even though operations are carried out - to the extent possible and appropriate - through its component parts, the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Indeed, the constitutional and the organisational profile of the institution are not in contradiction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Although a federal and decentralised central bank is not a novelty, the Eurosystem is a special case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It is the central bank of an economy that has a much deeper national segmentation than any other currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Its components have for many generations   performed the full range of central banking functions under their own responsibility and in a national context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.2,0)">They have been accountable to, and sometimes dependent on, national institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Public opinion has perceived, and still perceives, them as national entities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.55,0)">The notion of the public interest they were referring to was the notion of a national interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.5,0)">Significant differences existed, and partly remain, in their tasks, organisations, statutes and cultures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In this situation, making the Eurosystem a central bank requires drawing the appropriate distinction between being national in the organisational sense and being euro area-wide in the definition of the public interest pursued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.61,0)">This is a difficult distinction to draw in conceptual terms, not only in practical terms or from the point of view of personal attitudes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.28,0)">In the preparatory discussions and negotiations that led to the Maastricht Treaty, central banks took the view that monetary functions are indivisible and that, contrary to the fiscal field, subsidiarity cannot apply to the monetary field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Their traditional and strongly held position has been that the public interest assigned to central bank is a whole which cannot easily be decomposed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Indeed, while there is a fairly well developed theory of fiscal federalism, there is no equivalent for the monetary field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.2,0)">As I said, I do think that the functions of a central bank constitute a whole that cannot be split.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This does not exclude that the Eurosystem should avoid seeking more uniformity than necessary and that some diversity is a positive factor and has always been valued as an aspect of the richness of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Perhaps even a limited degree of internal competition may be used as an incentive to good performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.53,0)">But can the Eurosystem depart from the two historical models of the Federal Reserve System and the Bundesbank?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.62,0)">What are, in conceptual terms, the criteria of what I just called the "appropriate distinction"?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What should be the touchstone?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.37,0)">It would be an illusion, I think, to expect or pretend to have a full and satisfactory answer solely from legal interpretation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.64,0)">And it would be unfortunate if the Eurosystem were to fall into the trap of the narrowly legalistic approach that paralyses international organisations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.93,0)">The Eurosystem is not an international organisation, its model is not the Articles of Agreement of the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Of course, the answer will have to comply with the Treaty, which provides useful guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.78,0)">However, the system is entrusted to decision-making bodies that are composed not of lawyers, but of central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">They carry the primary responsibility to manage the euro and are accountable for that responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.09,0)">They have known for years what a central bank is and how vague the wordings of central bank statutes have historically been.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Their touchstone can only be, in the end, the effectiveness in the accomplishment of the basic mission embodied in the triadic paradigm of central banking functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.44,0)">DEALING WITH EUROPEAN UNEMPLOYMENT The second challenge comes from the high level of unemployment in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.8,0)">Every economist, observer or policy-maker would probably agree that the most serious problem for the European economy, today and in the years to come, is high unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.55,0)">In large parts of continental Europe the economic system just seems to have lost the ability to create new jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Also on the nature and causes of European unemployment there is a large degree of agreement, as there was agreement on the nature and causes of European inflation well before price stability was finally restored in the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The key words describing such agreement are structural factors and flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.41,0)">There is agreement that perverse incentives, direct and indirect taxation of labour, unsustainable pension schemes, overly tight employment rules and rigidities throughout the economy are the main obstacles to the creation of new jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">There is agreement that the typically European welfare state system should be profoundly corrected, but not suppressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.8,0)">Many also think that rather than following a "Thatcherian" policy of cracking down on the trade unions, it would be preferable to work with, rather than against, the labour organisations, although reform entails occasional confrontations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.77,0)">As with inflation in the 1970s and 1980s, so unemployment in the 1990s - while being a European disease - is quite diversified across European countries and regions, due to differences in both policies and economic situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.97,0)">It is over or around 20 per cent in the Mezzogiorno and Sachsen-Anhalt, but below 7 per cent in Lombardy and Baden-Württemberg; over 18 per cent in Spain, but less than 4 in the Netherlands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Notwithstanding the intergovernmental debates at a European level and the stated intention to undertake common initiatives, the instruments of employment policy remain in national hands, although only partly in the hands of governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I regard this as appropriate because competition should not be suppressed from the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.77,0)">Adopting the appropriate policies of structural reform has proved extremely difficult in many key European countries, including my own and this one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Other countries, such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have been more successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.13,0)">Even the most successful experiences, however, have shown that reducing unemployment is a long and gradual process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Although some countries started labour market reforms in the early 1980s, they only reaped the benefits in the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Unemployment will thus remain with us in the years to come and I am convinced that it should be regarded as the greatest policy challenge not only by governments and labour organisations, but by the Eurosystem as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.8,0)">Let me explain why.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.22,0)">An economy in which unemployment drags above 10 per cent for years is a sick economy, just like one in which public finances or inflation are chronically destroying savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">To operate in a sick economy is always a risk for the central bank and for the successful fulfilment of its primary mission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.83,0)">In the case of prolonged unemployment, the risk arises both on a functional and an institutional ground.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">On a functional ground, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.33,0)">from the point of view of the relationship between economic variables that models usually consider, a chronically weak economy is one in which expectations deteriorate, investments stagnate, consumption declines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.56,0)">Structural unemployment may increase the risk of a deflationary spiral because a longer expected duration of unemployment may imply that households respond more conservatively   in the face of a deflationary shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Today, we see no signs of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Markets and observers who pay attention to communications by the Eurosystem know that the monetary policy strategy of the euro area is symmetrical, equally attentive to inflation and deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Thus, they know that if that risk became reality, the Eurosystem would have to act, and would act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.27,0)">But we know that monetary policy is much less effective in countering deflation than it is in countering inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.44,0)">A more insidious threat, however, may arise on the institutional ground.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It comes from a chain of causation involving social attitudes, economic theory and policy, actual economic developments and institutional arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.64,0)">Attitudes of society respond to economic situations and policies, which in turn depend on the state of development of economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.8,0)">Institutions, on their part, are influenced by attitudes of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.19,0)">Both the course of economic thought and the practice of policy were lastingly altered by the Great Depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.88,0)">The epitome of this historical event was the Keynesian revolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In many countries the strong consensus about the primacy of price stability and the independence of the central bank was the outcome of the prolonged inflation suffered in the 1970s and 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.83,0)">Here in Germany, it is rooted in the experience of hyperinflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.8,0)">Would such a consensus survive if high unemployment remained a chronic feature of key European economies for many more years?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.37,0)">And how would the position of the central bank change if that consensus faltered?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">As central bankers primarily concerned with price stability, what can we do to cope with this challenge and to reduce the risks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.58,0)">My answer may seem disappointingly partial, as I do not think there is a miraculous medicine that monetary policy can provide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.25,0)">I would phrase it as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Firstly, the central banker should be aware of the danger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">He should know that in the future his principal objective may not receive, from the public, governments and parliaments the same strong support which has been the outcome of the two decades of high inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Since unemployment is what concerns the voters and the youngsters most, it may be increasingly necessary for him to play an educational role in explaining the benefits of a stable currency to those who have not directly experienced the costs of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.32,0)">This is very much like the case of the post-war generations in Europe which, being fortunate enough not to experience the horror of World War II, need now to be reminded about the human costs of that terrible conflict.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.87,0)">Secondly, the central banker should avoid mistakes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">It may seem obvious, but he should never forget that independence does not mean infallibility and that the likely new environment will offer no forgiveness for mistakes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.78,0)">A mistake would be the attempt to provide a substitute for the lack of structural policies by providing unnecessary monetary stimulus: it is not because the right medicine is neither supplied by the pharmacist nor demanded by the patient that the wrong medicine becomes effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.14,0)">Another mistake would be to give the impression that the central bank has a ceiling in mind for growth, rather than for inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">On the contrary, the central bank should make it clear that any rate of non-inflationary growth is welcomed and would be accommodated, the higher the better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Technically, this will not be an easy task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.8,0)">The analytical uncertainty surrounding estimates of potential output and its growth rate might lead the central banker to respond quite cautiously to evidence of shifts in the rate of non-inflationary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.59,0)">While such caution is certainly optimal from an inflation stabilisation point of view, it might be wrongly interpreted as a systematic deflationary bias by the public and the politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">This is a clear case in which any progress made by scholars in refining the analytical tools of the economic profession will greatly help the central banker to achieve his goals without imposing unnecessary costs on society at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.58,0)">On the whole, however, it is part of the central banker's role to make the day-by-day decisions that, in the end, constitute monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This responsibility can be neither transferred to, nor challenged by, policy makers responsible for other areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.63,0)">Last week, the Eurosystem has made, for the first time in its life, an affirmative monetary policy decision by lowering its official rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In this way, the Eurosystem has acted in line with its monetary policy strategy and made a significant contribution towards an economic environment in which the considerable growth potential of the euro area can be exploited in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It is now the responsibility of other sectors of economic policy making to do their part by strictly adhering to the Stability and Growth Pact and implementing decisive structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">MANAGING FINANCIAL TRANSFORMATIONS The third challenge consists in accompanying and surveying the rapid changes the European financial institutions and markets are undergoing, and will continue to undergo over the coming years, partly - but not exclusively - as a consequence of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It is sufficient to observe the US Federal Reserve System to understand the role the Eurosystem should play in the coming years: attention in monitoring changes in the financial system, active participation in the policy debate caused by such change, intense dialogue with both the Administration and Congress, influence exerted on opinions and decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To a large extent the factors of change are technology determined, hence independent of the euro and even not specifically European.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Technology is the driving force of the transformation in banking and finance that modifies the traditional deposit loan structure of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.71,0)">Technology also reshapes dramatically the back office and the communication with customers, thus producing massive over-branching and over-staffing in traditional banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Also the globalisation of finance comes primarily from the combination of data processing and telecommunications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Other changes are specifically European.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Since universal banking has historically prevailed in continental Europe, the change from an institution-based to a market-based financial system is particularly significant in this part of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Similarly, the development of financial conglomerates is more pronounced in Europe than in the United States or Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.35,0)">Typical of continental Europe are also the labour market rigidities that make the restructuring of banks so difficult and slow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Finally, there are changes induced by the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.79,0)">The removal of currency specificity as a cause of national segmentation of the financial industry is causing a convulsive shake-up of both institutions and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Since the beginning of this year, about ten banks ranking near the top of their respective national lists have concluded or started merger operations in France, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium and Norway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In most European countries stock exchanges and other organised markets, which were legally and structurally organised as providers of a public service, have been transformed into profit-driven private institutions and are now in a process of rapid concentration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.44,0)">In the coming two or three years the number of banks will shrink, the largest banks will become much larger, few financial centres and market networks will replace the present one-country one-centre configuration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In any national system the central bank would actively monitor and even guide the course of such a transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It would do so along with the various agencies responsible for financial supervision and competition policy, and with an involvement of the executive power itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Although largely determined by business decisions, these developments indeed involve the public interest in various ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.58,0)">Surveying and accompanying a profound transformation of the financial industry would be a difficult task for any central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">For the Eurosystem it will represent a daunting challenge because it will put to the test an unprecedented articulation of the policy functions that are called for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me briefly explain this assertion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The institutional setting of the euro area establishes a double separation between central banking and other public functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Firstly, a functional separation, whereby banking supervision is now assigned to institutions that - even when they are national central banks - no longer exert independent monetary policy functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Of this separation we have many previous examples  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.68,0)">Much newer is a second, geographical, separation, whereby - with only the partial exception of competition policy - the area of jurisdiction of central banking does not coincide with the area of jurisdiction of the other public functions involved  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.52,0)">Experts, including academic people, have so far focused attention on lender-of-last-resort functions and suggested that the new setting would not be able to act effectively in a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.49,0)">I have argued elsewhere why this criticism seems unjustified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Here, I would like to suggest that the real challenge could come, in my opinion, from tensions between the national and the euro area interest in the process of financial transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.7,0)">The process of industry transformation will inevitably involve aspects that have traditionally been considered as sensitive by public authorities: suppression of jobs, location of facilities and headquarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Financial transformation will also produce a hardening of competition and competition will be, to a considerable extent, one between national financial centers and industries, not only between individual banks or institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The propensity to defend national champions may prevail over the pursuit of efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.42,0)">The risk for the Eurosystem to fall in the trap of an improper interplay between the EU and the national dimension of the public interest may become high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Like any central bank, the Eurosystem should be both active and neutral in the great transformation of "its" financial industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The word "system" that is part of its own name refers, and should apply in practice, to the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.96,0)">COPING WITH A LACK OF POLITICAL UNION The fourth challenge consists in coping with the lack of a political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.07,0)">The relationship between monetary and political union and whether the latter should be a precondition for the former has been a central issue in the European debate well before the establishment of the Delors Committee in 1988.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.69,0)">While I do think that there is a lack of political union and that this lack constitutes a serious challenge for the Eurosystem, I also think that the expression "lack of political union" is often used in an unclear way that blurs the issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me thus first consider two meanings of this expression with which I do not concur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.8,0)">First, I do not concur with the idea that there is no political union in Europe today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It is not because the content and the competence of the European Union are mainly economic, that its nature and historical role are not political Even before the single currency, EU competence extended over virtually the whole Corpus Iuris of economic activity, from the establishment of "the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital"   to external economic relationships.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">To understand how very political these issues are, it should suffice to think about the place they take in the US political debate today, or have taken in the politics of our countries before the creation of the European Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Moreover, the institutional architecture of the European Union is entirely that of a political system, not that of an international organisation based on intergovernmental co-operation: a legislative capacity that prevails over that of Member States, a judicial power, a directly elected Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Second, I do not concur with the idea that Monetary Union has developed outside the political process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Quite the contrary is true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The establishment of a single currency in the European Union has been achieved because of the strong political determination of elected governments over a full decade, from June 1988 to May 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">It is significant that during that long period continuity has not been broken by repeated changes of political majority in virtually all countries except Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.44,0)">Technocrats, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">central bankers, have "only" played their role, crucial as it may be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">They have provided expertise, from the drafting of the blueprint to the preparatory work for the actual start of the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">And, no less important, they have loyally accepted the limits of their role and recognised that the ultimate decisions have belonged to elected politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.32,0)">This is the meaning of the two statements of July 1988 and March 1998 with which the Bundesbank has defined its position at the beginning and the end of the crucial decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">"In der Beschränkung zeigt sich der Meister".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The establishment of a single currency is a strongly political event in its genesis and a profound social and cultural change in its nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.72,0)">As economists and central bankers we pay limited attention to notes and coins because they are a minor and endogenous component of the money stock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.55,0)">For many politicians, however, Monetary Union meant little else than a common banknote.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">They saw, better than us, that for the people money has to do with the perception of the society to which they belong and, ultimately, with their culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As such, money goes well beyond the economic sphere of human action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.79,0)">Indeed, the act whereby we accept to provide goods or services to an unknown person in exchange for pieces of paper that have no intrinsic value is perhaps the most significant and widespread testimony of the social contract that binds people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.56,0)">This is why coinage and money printing have always been a prerogative of the State.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.65,0)">Yet, for two main reasons it remains true that Europe has a lack of political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.48,0)">First, the European Union is still not the ultimate provider of internal and external security, the two key functions that constitute the raison d'être of the modern State.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.16,0)">Second, EU institutions still fail to comply with the key constitutional principles that constitute the heritage of western democracies: foundation of the legislative and executive functions on the popular vote, majority principle, equilibrium of powers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.87,0)">Why does the lack of political union constitute a challenge for the Eurosystem?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.16,0)">I would answer as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.13,0)">In a period of less than thirty years money has abandoned both the anchors it has had since the earliest times: metal and the sovereign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.32,0)">It is true that central banks have struggled for years to free the printing press from the influence of the modern sovereign, as they struggled in the past to free it from the influence of private interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">It is equally true that the present status of the Eurosystem in the constellation of public powers is exceptionally favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">However, only a superficial thinker could confuse independence with solitude and take the view that the lack of political union strengthens the position of the central bank and makes it freer to fulfil its mission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The security on which a sound currency assesses its role cannot be provided exclusively by the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It derives from a number of elements that only the State or, more broadly, a political union as previously defined, can provide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">When we say that a currency is a "safe haven" we refer not only to the quality and credibility of its central bank, but to the solidity of the whole social, political and economic structure to which it belongs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.6,0)">And historical experience shows that when that structure appears to weaken, the currency weakens, irrespective of the actions of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">A strong currency requires a strong economy and a strong polity, not only a competent central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.19,0)">The central bank is, and should remain, an institution with too limited a mission to replace the lack of a political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The problems posed by the coexistence of a single currency with a still unachieved political union will influence both practical and intellectual activity in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.29,0)">They will have implications for the central banker, the politician and, more generally, the citizen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For the politician the implication is that his political decision to move ahead with Monetary Union in advance of political union contains an implicit commitment to work for the completion of political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.67,0)">The central banker should be aware of the special difficulties and responsibilities deriving from this anomalous condition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">On the one hand he will have to cope with this situation and adapt his attitudes to a composite - EU and national - institutional architecture, one that lacks the simplicity he was used to and in which the Eurosystem now represents the most advanced supranational component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">On the other he should be prepared for the further evolution of that same architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Finally, from the citizens that we all are, it will require a deeper reflection about the multiple "social contracts" he is part of, and the loyalties they entail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">CONCLUSION I have been fortunate to operate in an environment in which no conflict has arisen between the central banking profession I have exercised for more than thirty years and the European conviction that, like many persons of my generation, I matured in my youth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Since the early '80s I have also been convinced that monetary union, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">a confluence of the two motives, was desirable and possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">At the same time, the challenges for the Eurosystem originate precisely from that confluence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The challenges are not solely economic in their nature, nor can their features be captured bythe functional relationships economists are most familiar with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Although partly related to economic factors, their features are in fact tied to the special institutional environment to which the Eurosystem now belongs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.59,0)">They derive from the tension between the completion of the union in the monetary field and the incompleteness of the overall construction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.68,0)">It is a tension because in that environment the notion of the public interest is no longer as simply and statically defined as it was when the Nation-State was an all-pervasive reality and the jurisdiction of the central bank coincided with its jurisdiction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.09,0)">Inevitably, this tension runs through the institutions of the European Union, the Eurosystem itself, and even our minds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.3,0)">A challenge is a call to a difficult task; it entails the two notions of necessity and difficulty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.32,0)">The problems I have tried to describe are a challenge not only for practitioners, but also for the academic profession, because their solutions can hardly be found in a textbook and will only be invented if the creativity of practitioners will be supplemented with that of scholars.</span>
