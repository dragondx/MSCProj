    <h3> Speaker: Vítor Constâncio </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)"> Presentation of the ECB Annual Report 2016 to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory remarks by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, Brussels, 10 April 2017 Mr Chairman, Honourable Members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Ladies and gentlemen, I am honoured to be here today before your Committee to present the ECB Annual Report for 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The Annual Report is an essential element of our democratic accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It supports the democratic debate regarding our decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And our accountability does not stop with our reporting obligations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This occasion ensures that our Annual Report will be discussed by the representatives of the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">We take our accountability to the European Parliament extremely seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This is the beginning of a well-established process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Our exchange today, and the regular dialogue between our two institutions, will feed into the European Parliament resolution on the ECB Annual Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">This is very important for us because we want to make sure that we deliver on the democratic mandate that was conferred upon the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The ECB is independent so that it can act in line with this mandate, without political interference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">And it is democratically and legally accountable to ensure that it does act in line with this mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As is customary, today we are also publishing our feedback concerning your resolution on our previous Annual Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">In introducing our discussion, I will touch upon our monetary policy decisions over the past year and their contribution to the ECB’s primary objective of maintaining price stability – a precondition for sustainable growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">That objective – which serves as a performance benchmark – supports both our independence and the accountability of our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">I will then continue by emphasising the importance of a strong financial system for a prosperous euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.25,0)">The euro area recovery and the support provided by the ECB’s monetary policy 2016 was, in many ways, a challenging year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.03,0)">The last time I spoke before this Committee, in April 2016 , the global economy was emerging from an acute episode of financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.0,0)">That episode had once again given rise to another phase of deep pessimism concerning not only the capacity of the world economy to generate positive growth, but also the ability of central banks to steer their economies by applying unconventional monetary policy tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.26,0)">Inflation was heading towards new lows, dragged down by a renewed sharp fall in commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Twelve months on, in part thanks to the measures that we took at that time   , macroeconomic conditions have improved and the euro area has been a major source of positive news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Fears of deflation have receded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Despite a still weak international backdrop, GDP grew at a solid rate of 1.7% in 2016 and in the first quarter of 2017, economic sentiment climbed to the highest levels since 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.13,0)">Unemployment is at its lowest point since May 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.88,0)">Over four and a half million more people are now employed than was the case three years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.81,0)">Our measures have also reduced fragmentation among Member States: the dispersion of both GDP growth and inflation rates is at the lowest level since the beginning of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Looking back, we can see how the measures that we took in March 2016 have effectively fed through to the broader economy, adding to the substantial monetary stimulus already in place at the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">They have built a new cushion that helped to firm up the recovery and make it more resilient to external shocks and uncertainties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">In December 2016 we decided to extend our asset purchases until December 2017, though at a reduced pace of €60 billion per month from April 2017 onwards, in line with the diminished risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">This safeguards the financing conditions that are still necessary to foster a return of inflation rates towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The measures the ECB took in March 2016 have supported the improvement in financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.69,0)">They have facilitated the continued fall in composite bank lending rates for loans to non-financial firms and for housing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.86,0)">Both have fallen to historically low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.78,0)">Overall, since May 2014, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.13,0)">immediately before our decision on a combination of measures to provide additional monetary policy accommodation and to support lending to the real economy, the decline in bank lending rates has amounted to almost 120 basis points for loans to firms, and around 110 basis points for housing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Likewise, lending volumes have increased considerably as growth in loans to firms recovered to 2.0% in February 2017, from ‑2.9% in May 2014, and for households to 2.3% from -0.1% over the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.0,0)">Small and medium-sized enterprises, the backbone of the euro area economy, have greatly benefited: their access to financing has significantly improved and their borrowing costs have dropped by around 40 basis points since March 2016 and around 180 basis points since May 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">By the end of 2016, the recovery was clearly firming and further broadening across sectors and countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Incoming data and sentiment indicators in the first quarter of this year suggest that the pace of growth may be gaining momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Nevertheless, the legacy of the financial crisis still determines today’s economic performance in many respects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.25,0)">Owing to a considerable amount of unutilised resources underlying inflation continues to lack a convincing upward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Headline inflation has increased but that mostly reflects rising energy and food prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.15,0)">The March flash estimate shows that headline inflation dropped to 1.5% from 2% in February and that underlying inflation decreased from 0.9% to 0.7%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.92,0)">We had previously warned that headline inflation could decline after March-April as a result of the reduced statistical base effect of comparing this year’s price levels of oil and other commodities with their levels a year ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.79,0)">The decrease in underlying inflation, however, was disappointing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.4,0)">The domestic drivers of inflation, namely wages, are not yet responding to the recovery and the narrowing output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.17,0)">According to our latest staff projections, inflation is expected to move towards 1.7% in 2019, but that assumes underlying inflation at 1.8% and wage growth at 2.4%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The foreseen increase in wages in the baseline scenario is thus essential for the staff projections for growth and inflation to materialise in 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Furthermore, while near-term projected inflation has been subject to sizeable upward revisions due to energy and food price rises, the medium-term outlook remains largely unaffected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.49,0)">More importantly, the upward path of headline inflation over the coming years remains highly dependent on monetary policy support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Against this background, it is appropriate to preserve the degree of monetary accommodation we are currently providing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Ensuring a safe and growth-supporting financial system While our monetary policy is primarily geared towards maintaining price stability, the ECB is also tasked with identifying and assessing the potential impact of systemic risks on the stability of the euro area financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Our Annual Report sets out four key risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">First, the possibility of a rise in global risk premia has increased in an environment of political uncertainty and benign pricing in the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.14,0)">Second, possible rising negative feedback loops between weak bank profitability, in the face of structural challenges in a low interest rate environment, and low nominal growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.8,0)">Third, political uncertainty which undermines reform efforts, with debt sustainability concerns resurfacing for the sovereign and non-financial private sectors in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.87,0)">Fourth, liquidity risk is increasing in the rapidly growing investment fund sector, with potential spillovers to the broader financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Beyond systemic risks at the aggregate euro area level, ­we are also closely monitoring risks arising at the country and sectoral levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Targeted macroprudential policy measures are the appropriate policy instruments to address these country or sector-specific risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As you know, responsibility for decisions on macroprudential measures in the euro area is shared between national authorities and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">This means that we can top up the macroprudential measures taken by national authorities for those instruments that are envisaged in EU legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The ECB strengthened its role in macroprudential policy in 2016 and also took action to improve transparency – the Governing Council published its first macroprudential statement in December 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Besides the risks in some countries’ real estate sectors, we noted that cyclical systemic risks in the euro area remained contained and, therefore, a broad-based increase in countercyclical capital buffers in the euro area was not warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">This view was in line with the decisions of the national authorities, with whom we enjoyed excellent cooperation over the past year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Transparency in the macroprudential policy domain was also enhanced by the launch of the new biannual ECB Macroprudential Bulletin in March 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Our 2016 Annual Report also focuses on the actions necessary to overcome the legacy of the crisis in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Decisive action is needed at the sectoral, national and European levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">First, banks need to continue adjusting their business models to better cope with the low interest rate environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As we show in a dedicated analysis contained in the Report, the optimal strategy is likely to depend on each bank’s core characteristics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Adjustments may include cross-border mergers and acquisitions where they allow efficiency gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Second, significant effort is needed to solve the problem of non-performing loans  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">The extent and macroprudential nature of the problem calls for a comprehensive and coordinated response at EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.65,0)">While actions should be taken by stakeholders at the national level, these should be harmonised in a European blueprint for asset management companies  , among the strategies to reduce the stock of NPLs on banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The issue is also being addressed as a matter of priority from a microprudential perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Further enhancing the European financial framework Turning now to financial regulation, the ECB is involved in shaping the regulatory framework at the international and European levels to ensure that it takes appropriate account of both macro- and microprudential considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In 2016, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision   agreed on several reforms, including the treatment of interest rate risk in the banking book, revisions to the securitisation framework, and a standard for the regulatory capital treatment of banks’ investments in total loss-absorbing capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It also issued public consultations on the regulatory treatment of accounting provisions and Pillar 3 disclosure requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">As part of the process to finalise the Basel III package, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision  , the oversight body of the BCBS, set out a work programme for the Committee to finalise its work to reduce excessive risk weight variability in risk-weighted assets, as well as the calibration of the leverage ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In January 2017, the GHoS welcomed the progress made by the BCBS towards completing the post-crisis reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">While more time is needed to finalise the reforms, the work is expected to be completed in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">It is crucial that we complete the post-crisis reform package and do not undo the progress made in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The ECB will continue to support work at the international level to achieve an appropriate regulatory framework that establishes a level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Over the last four years, we have also made significant progress at the European level, namely with the establishment of the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">At this stage, it is crucial to take the remaining additional steps which are necessary to complete it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The ECB has helped, and will continue to help, to bring forward the two processes of risk reduction and risk sharing, within its mandate as a central bank and supervisor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">In this context, accelerating the work on creating a European deposit insurance scheme is essential, as is introducing a common backstop for the Single Resolution Fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">In parallel, the European Commission’s package reviewing the current EU regulatory framework for banks is moving in the right direction in terms of risk reduction measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">It is expected to make a significant contribution to strengthening banking regulation, supervision and resolution, even if there are some areas for improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">These achievements in the regulatory framework for banks will be accompanied by regulatory initiatives for financial markets and financial infrastructures, in order to cope with the changing landscape in the euro area financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">From this perspective, acting decisively to build a fully fledged capital markets union   is a priority for the EU as whole, and also for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">A CMU with deeper, more integrated and well-supervised capital markets can increase risk sharing via cross-border investment, contribute to macroeconomic and financial stability and ultimately facilitate the transmission of monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is also important to establish the legal basis for macroprudential tools that can be used to address risks to financial stability that emerge from outside the banking sector, as well as to include a macroprudential perspective in the regulation of non-bank financial institutions across the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Greater financial risk sharing, diversification and heightened competition between banks and non-banks, and across borders, bring material economic benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Indeed, capital markets can be an important complement to banks when it comes to providing finance to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">At the same time, such developments inevitably call for heightened financial stability surveillance outside the banking system perimeter and the appropriate policy toolkit to address related risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The euro area economy demonstrated substantial resilience in 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The recovery is progressing and is now gaining momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Our monetary policy stance is appropriate and a reassessment is not warranted at this stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">However, we continue to stand ready to react to downside shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">While cyclical conditions have improved, we still need to address, without delay, the legacy of the crisis and reinforce the structural underpinnings of our Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.01,0)">Tomorrow would have been the 97th birthday of a former President of the European Parliament, Emilio Colombo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.31,0)">Let me recall his words of almost 40 years ago, which have particular resonance now, when one Member State has given notice of its intention to leave the Union: We have no reason for complacency about the present state of Europe in spite of the efforts we have made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">as Europeans we can make a real impact when we manage to find the right joint solutions to the problems of our time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">These words remind us of the importance of our responsibility as a Union to steadily strive, together, towards achieving better economic outcomes for our citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">They included lowering the key ECB interest rates, expanding the asset purchase programme, including corporate bonds in the programme, and creating a new medium-term liquidity facility to support bank lending.</span><span
