    <span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)"> Exchange rate moves in a global economy: a central banking perspective Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBFederal Reserve Bank of PhiladelphiaPhiladelphia, 3 December 2004 Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, Let me express first of all my gratitude to the organisers for the opportunity of being here to share with you some thoughts on such an important subject.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The timing for this venue has turned out to be very wisely chosen indeed, with exchange rate developments just being back in the international debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.38,0)">In my short presentation I will not speak, for obvious reasons, about the present situation of exchange rates as regards the euro and the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I will therefore touch upon the following issues: First, I will briefly mention some of the challenges faced in understanding exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But I will also argue that we cannot abstain from analysing them, Then I will shortly review the history of the monetary system in order to present the current system in perspective, Third, I will try to elaborate on the question whether larger swings in the exchange rate matter for the real economy, Furthermore, I will deal with the question of what might be the appropriate policy responses to exchange rate swings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">There, I will emphasise in particular that the main policy objective is to preserve sound domestic economic fundamentals; I will also refer to the monetary integration process of the new EU member states towards the euro area and their exchange rate arrangements; Before concluding, I will shortly highlight some of the challenges that I see ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.66,0)">The difficulties and importance of exchange rate economics You will probably agree with me that the field of exchange rate economics, while a fascinating subject, often faces a certain degree of scepticism, both in academic and policy circles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.98,0)">Consensus seems hard to reach other than on negative statements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The common view is that exchange rate movements are difficult to predict and that random walk models generally have at least as good forecasting properties as standard macroeconomic models - even assuming ex-post knowledge of economic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.91,0)">What is perhaps surprising is that this widespread scepticism about exchange rate economics does not halt numerous calls for policy responses every time a currency swings noticeably or does not move against another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">This is a sign that, despite all the difficulties in understanding them, exchange rate movements are seen as important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.97,0)">The price-competitiveness-channel is of course the most obvious transmission mechanism, as movements in the nominal effective exchange rate affect relative export prices with a subsequent impact on real exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">There are, however, many other reasons why exchange rate changes are important: They influence import and consumer price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.51,0)">Larger and persistent swings affect the tradables and non-tradables production structure of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.9,0)">They are an important autonomous source of shocks that may have critical repercussions domestically and possible spillovers on other economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Exchange rate changes are also seen by some as an important adjustment mechanism for correcting external imbalances, although the relationship between both variables is far from being straightforward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.17,0)">Finally, according to some studies the volatility of the exchange rate may have an adverse impact on trade and the real economy in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">The evolution of the international monetary system It is worth noting that the international monetary system has generally evolved towards greater exchange rate flexibility between major currency pairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Historically, one can distinguish 5 main phases in which this has taken place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The gold standard imposed itself over the bimetallic standard   just after 1870 when the United States and other major European countries opted for this regime, which was already in use in Britain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This period, which is sometimes called the Gilded Age, was characterised by fixed exchange rates and gold convertibility of currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.75,0)">It ended when World War I broke out and most countries decided to restrict or abandon gold convertibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">The interwar period was characterised by a progressive return to the gold standard with the aim of restoring financial discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.69,0)">The experience of the Great Depression, however, led many countries to see the system as faulty, with Britain and the Sterling bloc exiting in 1931 followed by the United States in 1937.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">After a short period of exchange rate flexibility in the pre World War II period, a new phase was opened with the establishment of the Bretton Woods agreement in 1944, which led to all major industrialised countries operating a peg versus the dollar until 1971.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This phase was followed by what could be described as 'the trial and error' system of the 1970s followed by a more consistent move towards exchange rate flexibility in the course of the 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">During the 1990s preparation for the creation of a single currency in Europe led to the elimination of the exchange rate risk for 12 European countries so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This leads us to the system of today, characterised – with a few exceptions – by flexible exchange rates amongst the major currencies, accompanied by a system of international co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">For the last 20 years the G7 has proven to be an effective forum where finance ministers and central bank governors can exchange views on a broad range of policy issues and can agree if appropriate, on specific policy messages, including, exceptionally, comments on foreign exchange market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Here, I refer for example to the G7 Communiqué agreed in Boca Raton in February 2004 and since then confirmed in subsequent meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Another important element of the international system is of course the role played by the IMF in helping countries to design appropriate macroeconomic and exchange rate policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This role, aimed mostly at crisis prevention, but also in some instances at crisis management, is of vital importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Finally, an important element of novelty in the international monetary system has been the process of regionalisation for example in Europe – with the launch of the euro and the enlargement of the European Union - and in Asia, with the impetuous growth of intra-regional trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.41,0)">Swings and exchange rate volatility – how much do they matter The key but far from straightforward question is of course “how much” exchange rate movements matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.26,0)">One may distinguish between effects taking place through the price-competitiveness-channel and those associated to market uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Focusing on the competitiveness channel, theory suggests that the size of the impact depends also on the structure of the economies, for example the degree of openness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.86,0)">Exchange rate movements have clearly a smaller impact on relatively closed economic areas than on small open economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">For example, exports of goods and services to countries outside the euro area accounted for about 19% of nominal GDP, which is considerably more than the respective figures for the United States   and Japan  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.92,0)">As regards the euro area, it is worth mentioning a fact that is often underestimated: the UK is the first trading partner of the euro area  , even ahead of the US  , while the share of the 10 new Member States in the euro area external trade is only marginally lower   than the US share.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A wide variety of models help to gauge the impact of exchange rate movements on both prices and GDP and generally find evidence of a significant impact, albeit the range of available estimates is admittedly rather large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Finally with respect to exchange rate volatility, a number of studies tend to indicate that exchange rate volatility may have an important impact on trade in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">There are, however, some important dampening factors, which can reduce the immediate observable effects of sizeable exchange rate moves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.57,0)">In particular, firms are sometimes in the position to squeeze profit margins without immediately reacting to unfavourable exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.27,0)">This is indeed reflected in some “disconnect” occasionally observed in the euro area between exchange rate movements and export price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.97,0)">In some cases firms also extensively use hedging instruments as a form of insurance against excessive exchange rate fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.14,0)">Finally, multinational firms by operating simultaneously in multiple markets may find themselves in a better position than others when an exchange rate shock takes place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The persistence of shocks is, however, an important element, as hedging and profit squeezing are mostly viewed as effective responses in the short to medium run only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Importance of regional integration The European integration process, including the introduction of the euro, reduces the instability generated by shocks to the exchange rate at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">The introduction of a common currency and the mechanisms of exchange rate co-operation within an enlarged Europe are factors that should continue to reduce exchange rate volatility within Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Other things being equal this should tend to boost intra-European trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.26,0)">As I mentioned, a number of studies find support for the hypothesis of a negative relationship between trade and exchange rate volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">An additional element to this analysis has been added by Rose,  arguing that a currency union has a positive impact on trade and potential output, which goes beyond the mere elimination of exchange rate volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">While only an appropriate econometric analysis can disentangle the impact of exchange rate volatility from other factors, since 1999 extra-euro area trade has grown at a somewhat faster rate than intra-trade, which was, however, very dynamic as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This may also reflect other important factors, as the relative cyclical position or globalisation and higher growth rates outside the euro zone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Macroeconomic stability is the key response It is my profound conviction that the best way to limit undesirable exchange rate instability and minimise global imbalances in a sustainable way is by ensuring sound domestic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The notion of stability-oriented policies should be the guiding principle both at the country level but also, I believe, in framing the discussions between counterparts in the international monetary system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">A monetary policy that is oriented towards price stability is ultimately conducive to exchange rate stability over a longer-term horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Sustainable medium-term fiscal policies are also conducive to balanced economic growth and ultimately helpful in avoiding the insurgence of imbalances also at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The common currency in Europe with its prerequisite of sound monetary and fiscal policies has helped many countries in Europe – euro area countries and new member states – to achieve better economic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Monetary integration in Europe: Exchange rate arrangements in the new member states and beyond Let me now come to the monetary integration process in the enlarged European Union and the exchange rate regime related to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">As you know, accession to the EU is only the beginning of the monetary integration process, which ends with the eventual adoption of the euro, as these countries have fully subscribed to the Maastricht Treaty without asking for an opting-out clause.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The path towards euro adoption is embedded in a well-defined multilateral institutional framework and comprises a number of phases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The first phase for the new Member States is the period after EU accession and before joining the exchange rate mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This mechanism defines a regime characterised by fixed, but adjustable, exchange rates, with a central rate against the euro and a standard fluctuation band of  ; pegs or managed floating with the euro as a reference currency  ; and, independent floating  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.53,0)">Finally, there are two territories within Serbia and Montenegro, namely Kosovo and Montenegro where the monetary and exchange rate policy is determined by their unilateral euroisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.17,0)">Country specific circumstances have called for different choices of monetary and exchange rate policy and changing circumstances may have called for changes in the approaches to be followed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">I will not expand on this issue further than to emphasise that regardless of the actual monetary and exchange rate framework chosen, it is crucial to consolidate a culture of price stability, supported by independent central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.74,0)">The challenges ahead What are the challenges ahead?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Several new challenges lie ahead, as the world is rapidly changing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">The Asian countries – and in particular China and India – are all becoming important global players, accounting for an increasing share in world demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Outsourcing is also a topical policy issue, both in developed and developing countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.67,0)">It is generating opportunities but also fears, as competitiveness pressures increasingly pervade selected sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">There appears to be some evidence that, over the past few decades, capital mobility has increased to levels unseen since the gold standard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">New export markets have gathered importance and foreign direct investment flows are directed to emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.86,0)">The increased integration of financial markets, the opening of new export markets as well as the prospect of higher streams of income across countries generated by foreign direct investment may arguably affect the sustainability boundaries of current account deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">In any case: Stability oriented policies remain the best safeguard both for developed and emerging markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Concluding remarks Turning to my conclusions let me summarise briefly by saying that exchange rate economics is a fascinating, difficult, yet important subject.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The evolution of the international system has led us to the system we have today, characterised by flexible exchange rates, regional integration and occasional swings between currency pairs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In my view, the best policy advice one can give is to work on stability of macroeconomic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This will, in turn, also have a smoothening effect on exchange rate developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The European example shows that there is more than one solution with respect to exchange rate regimes: even within the enlarged European Union the way of monetary integration is characterised by country specific choices of their exchange rate regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">The overarching objective is, however, to achieve stability, measured against the Maastricht criteria, which need to be fulfilled in a sustainable way before adopting the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">The key challenges of the future are to increase the long-term growth prospects, make progress on financial market integration and continue stability oriented policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">On this, all major players have some home work to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">and K.
