    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.49,0)"> Ten years after the crisis – risks, rules and supervision Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the 13th ASBA-BCBS-FSI High-Level Meeting on Global and Regional Supervisory Priorities in Nassau, Bahamas, 30 October 2018 Ten years have passed since the financial crisis erupted – an entire decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.08,0)">But it is still very present in our minds, and no one wants to go through it all again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">So, the key question is: how can we prevent such crises in the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">To answer that question, we need an intimate knowledge of the things that led to the crisis in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.92,0)">As you are probably only too familiar with these things, I will spare you the long version of events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.34,0)">The short version is that risks were too high, rules were too soft, and supervision was too lax.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.94,0)">Ten years on, this has changed – or has it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Are banks now better regulated and supervised?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Are risks under control?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Let’s take a look at whether we have really succeeded in making the banking sector a safer place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Tougher rules – but implementation is key Over the past ten years, a lot of brainpower has gone into untangling the complex web of factors which led to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.76,0)">But analysis is just the first step, of course; the second step is action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">And action was and is still needed to ensure the resilience of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We all know that it’s this second step where one can easily stumble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Moving from analysis to action always requires a lot of political will and consensus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.6,0)">And this time, it was even more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.13,0)">The financial crisis had revealed how interconnected the financial system had become.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">So any action to make the system more resilient had to be taken at the global level too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.47,0)">This added another layer of complexity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">But with memories of the crisis still fresh, countries from around the world managed to agree on a large set of reforms, with Basel III being the cornerstone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">It took some time to finalise these reforms, but it is still a remarkable achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">A remarkable achievement, for sure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But let us not forget that the proof is in the pudding, as they say.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Basel III needs to be implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">And since the banking system is global in scope, Basel III needs to be implemented on a global scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Banking might have become a bit more national here and there, ring-fencing a bit more en vogue and the idea of withdrawing from the global stage a bit fashionable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">But banks are so closely connected across borders that no national approach will ever be able to deal with the risks involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.81,0)">Against this backdrop, I am a bit worried that we are losing momentum on this front.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.31,0)">There seems to be less and less drive to follow through on the reforms that were agreed in Basel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Europe is no exception here, by the way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.25,0)">Lawmakers are reviewing the related legislation, and we are seeing some proposals which would mean that European rules deviate from the standards agreed upon in Basel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.74,0)">This would affect the net stable funding ratio and the leverage ratio, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.75,0)">It would also affect the way in which we deal with market risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The fundamental review of the trading book is important here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">It is meant to address the shortcomings of the previous market risk framework and is thus an important part of the reform package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.8,0)">However, it seems that we might get caught in a global cycle of postponing its implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.75,0)">This would not be good: market risk in particular is global in nature and requires global rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.32,0)">We seem to be seeing an old story unfolding before our eyes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In times of crisis, everyone agrees that tougher rules are needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.96,0)">But as soon as things start to get better, rules are suddenly seen as preventing banks from doing good business and the economy from growing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.58,0)">Consequently, rules are softened, banks are “freed”, the economy grows, and the seeds for the next crisis are sown – because such growth cannot be sustained in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Sustainable growth needs to be financed by stable banks that price risks correctly and cover them with adequate capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.69,0)">It’s a simple lesson, but it seems to be quite a hard one to learn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.36,0)">Failing to implement the rules is a clear risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.4,0)">But given the global scale of the banking sector, another risk is that the rules will be implemented unevenly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This would enable banks to go wherever the rules are softest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In the worst case, some countries might try to turn this into a business model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.19,0)">But let me assure you: light-touch regulation is not a viable business model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We have seen it before, and we know what comes next.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The only way to go is to implement Basel III and to do so faithfully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">We need to fight the misguided attempt to sacrifice global stability in order to make national banking sectors more competitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The risks involved outweigh the returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.37,0)">And what’s more, those who reap the returns are often not those who bear the risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.06,0)">But even if the rules were faithfully implemented everywhere, that would not be the end of the story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.81,0)">Banks still need to adjust to the new rulebook, and they might do so in the wrong way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">It is a fact of life that banks will look for room to manoeuvre, and experience tells us that they will find it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">It might take some time as the framework is still new, but it will happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.4,0)">And this will undermine the purpose of the rules and increase risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That’s why we keep an eye on regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And here we quite often see something that could be termed regulatory maturity “optimisation”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.28,0)">For example, some banks exploit the fact that prudential requirements are tied to the timing and maturity of transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.07,0)">This kind of arbitrage happens around the world and can take many forms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.26,0)">One prominent example is window dressing around quarter-end dates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.12,0)">This affects the leverage ratio in cases where it needs to be disclosed on a quarterly basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.02,0)">Banks might thus “dress up” their balance sheets just four times a year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">So, it might well be a good idea to switch to daily average reporting, at least for some components of the leverage ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.7,0)">In other cases, banks artificially reduce the regulatory maturities of transactions through the use, or restructuring, of derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This allows them to exploit loopholes in the capital and liquidity standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">We keep a close eye on these trends, including the growth of the settlement-to-market model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">In order to deal with arbitrage, we need to cooperate across borders; the loopholes should be closed everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Only then can we ensure the sustained effectiveness of the post-crisis reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Better supervision – a new approach Ladies and gentlemen, rules are important and they need to be implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.68,0)">But rules alone are not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">You also need people to check whether banks are following the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.35,0)">You need supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And this leads us directly to the first “supervisory” issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.58,0)">Before the crisis, supervisors often did just that: they checked whether banks were complying with the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.05,0)">This compliance-based approach proved to be too limited, though.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It didn’t require supervisors to truly understand the risk profiles of banks, and it didn’t require them to think ahead and look out for new risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.17,0)">So supervisors needed to change their approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Dealing with a global banking sector that is constantly evolving requires supervisors who know when it’s time to act, who are willing to act and who are able to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.24,0)">From this, everything else follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">First of all, supervisors must take a risk-based and forward-looking approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.57,0)">The days of mere box-ticking are over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Supervisors must understand the business models of banks and the economic environment in which they operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">They must understand banks’ internal control systems and their governance structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And in all of this, they need to have an eye on the future: it’s not just today’s risks that count; it’s also those of tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Next, supervisors must be adaptive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">The banking sector is steadily evolving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It evolves quickly and not always in a straight line.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Supervisors need to keep pace and be aware of any new risks that might emerge along the way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.66,0)">In addition, supervisors must be intrusive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">They must dig deep to obtain an intimate knowledge of their banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This knowledge then allows them to be sceptical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.08,0)">They do not have to rely on what the banks tell them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.42,0)">Instead, they can form their own opinion and challenge the banks’ views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But it’s not just about digging deep.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">It’s also about broadening the perspective and using all the available tools to spot trends and anomalies in the behaviour of banks as well as to identify best practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The ECB, for instance, benchmarks banks that pursue the same line of business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Supervising the 118 largest banking groups from across the euro area means that we benefit from a deep quantitative and qualitative analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">This allows us to challenge banks in a more credible manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">And speaking of credibility brings me to a very important point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.4,0)">Supervisors must be independent!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">They must be able to take their own decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">They must be free from pressure from banks or other stakeholders – and they must be free from political trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But it’s not just about formal independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.78,0)">Supervisors must also be independent of mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.52,0)">They must avoid groupthink and other biases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">And finally, supervisors must acknowledge that they are dealing with a banking system that is global in scope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This means they must reach out to others; international cooperation has become crucial for good supervision.And here the Financial Stability Institute plays an important role; it helps to bring together supervisors at all levels from around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, I have now listed a few of the traits that help supervisors to do a good job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.12,0)">But there is one trait that I have left out so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It is probably one of the most important traits, but it is also one that makes us a bit less likeable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.37,0)">We supervisors must be the spoilsports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.97,0)">We must be the ones who force banks to prepare for a storm when the sun is shining brightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Do the banks like that?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Probably not – at least in my experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.58,0)">Should we care?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">No.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As you recently put it, Agustín: “…we have come to appreciate how unrewarding it can be to flag risks when markets are running hot”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.82,0)">And we cannot help it: it is our job to look out for clouds on the horizon and draw attention to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">So, let’s do just that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Let’s try to spot the clouds; let’s take a look at some of the risks that are out there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.3,0)">Risks – what’s looming on the horizon?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Of course, not all risks are relevant for all people and in all places.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.86,0)">But the crisis taught us that we cannot turn a blind eye to the risks of others because they might quickly become our own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.54,0)">Looking at the risks we currently face, there are some well-known ones, of course: geopolitical uncertainties related to trade tensions and Brexit, for example, and legacy assets such as non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.23,0)">But there’s more – unfortunately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.68,0)">There are many things that banks have to adjust to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.35,0)">And the risk is that some will either fail to adjust at all, or they will go about it the wrong way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For quite some time now, banks have operated in an environment that is kind of special.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">There has been a long period of loose monetary policy, low interest rates, abundant liquidity and solid economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.38,0)">All this may have come to feel normal, but it isn’t.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.41,0)">There are many things that could trigger a sudden change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.54,0)">When that happens, risk and term premia in financial markets will snap back and emerging markets might be affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.28,0)">And all this could cause trouble for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.44,0)">The value of mark-to-market assets might go down, costs of funding might go up, interest income would go down, and so on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We supervisors must ask whether banks are prepared for such change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Are they pricing risks correctly?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Are they mindful of the fact that historical data now include a long period of special circumstances?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.89,0)">Have they cleaned up their balance sheets?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I think I already mentioned that these preparations should be made as long as the sun is shining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Another source of change is technological, and it’s already happening: digitalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In itself this is both a risk and an opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Which of the two will become more relevant in the end depends on how banks adjust to the new digital world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Are they investing in their IT systems, stepping up their protection against cybercrime and finding ways to hold their own against new competitors?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">If they do these things, digitalisation offers great opportunities to unlock new business and cut costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">If they don’t, others will take over: small and agile fintech start-ups or the big and powerful tech giants, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.51,0)">And if that happens, it would add to one of the problems some banks already have: profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.67,0)">It has become more difficult for banks to make money – not least due to low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.23,0)">In Europe, a number of banks struggle to earn their cost of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.16,0)">And again, there is the danger of adjusting in the wrong way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.78,0)">Banks might embark on a search for yield and take on too much risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Some observers have recently identified leveraged loans as an area of potential concern in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In 2017, the issuance of leveraged loans indeed reached a new high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The worrying thing is that investors seem to be ready to accept lower protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">They have become more lenient in their credit policies – the share of covenant-lite loans has become quite high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Against this backdrop, the ECB issued guidance on such loans which entered into force at the end of 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.22,0)">This was followed by relatively low volumes of leveraged loans being issued in the first few months of 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But this doesn’t mean that we can relax just yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Non-banks might step in and become more active in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And this brings me to another risk: shadow banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This part of the financial system has grown quite big in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In the EU alone, it accounts for 40% of assets in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.39,0)">However, we do not have a clear picture of the shadow banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.55,0)">In the EU, almost half of all assets in the shadow banking sector are held by institutions for which we lack a detailed statistical breakdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.29,0)">But why should we, as banking supervisors, care about non-banks in the first place?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Well, we should care because there are close links between banks and non-banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And close links mean mutual exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Take funding as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">In 2017, wholesale funding to euro area banks from entities in the shadow banking sector reached a staggering €2.2 trillion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">So, there is another source of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">To be able to monitor this risk, we need to close the data gaps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">We need more data to bring shadow banking out of the shadows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We need more data to examine and understand this large part of the financial system more thoroughly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.58,0)">Otherwise, we might overlook risks that could spill over to banks and threaten their stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">So, supervisors need to have a broad perspective and they need to look ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And if they want to be truly forward-looking, they have to step out of their comfort zone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">They need to monitor risks which are not fully clear today, but may become an issue in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Risks related to climate change are a perfect example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.23,0)">I am aware that some see climate change as a matter just for scientists and politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">And in a way, they are right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But then again, we all share this one planet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.86,0)">And a changing climate affects us not only as inhabitants of this planet, but also as bankers and supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Fortunately, many authorities have realised we need to do more in this field, but work is still in the early stages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I see three challenges for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">First, there are physical risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.77,0)">More frequent and more severe storms, floods, droughts, heatwaves and rising sea levels have already caused losses for businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.69,0)">When these risks were uninsured, they had very direct effects on banks’ credit risk, for example through damaged collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Second, “green finance” is a growing area of business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As all supervisors know well, financial innovation can bring a lot of good – but it can also spin out of control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">So, we must monitor green finance just as we would monitor any other type of financial innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Third, there is the transition to a low-carbon economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.16,0)">Policies to encourage a more sustainable way of doing business will have far-reaching consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.14,0)">For one, they could impact the banks’ customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.67,0)">Think of car manufacturers or energy suppliers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.68,0)">And they could affect commodity and energy prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.67,0)">This in turn could change market risks for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.39,0)">I know this is an apparent paradox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.83,0)">The policies required to shift to a more sustainable economy could at the same time upset financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.11,0)">But this should not scare us into inaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.87,0)">Because again, the true risk is that banks do not adjust or adjust in the wrong way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">As supervisors, we should keep on doing what we have learned to do since the crisis: expand our horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">In practice, this could mean encouraging banks to recognise the potential impact of climate risk on their exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.93,0)">I am well aware that longer-term trends are hard to incorporate into risk analyses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.61,0)">But ignoring them is not the answer at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, Let us return to the initial question: has the banking sector become a safer place?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Yes, it has.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">However, we are talking about a moving target; the business of banking constantly evolves and changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.89,0)">What is safe today might not be tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Thus, we must keep a close eye on new developments and the risks that might accompany them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">And we need to exchange views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">We need to meet; we need to discuss; we need to learn from each other’s experiences; and we need to sharpen our analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">As I said before, other countries’ risks can quickly become our own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">That’s why I’m happy to be here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">I am sure that we will have very interesting debates, and that we can all learn from each other.</span>
