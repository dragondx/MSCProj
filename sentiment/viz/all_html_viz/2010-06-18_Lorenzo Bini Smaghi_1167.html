    <span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)"> The financial and fiscal crisis: a euro area perspective Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Le Cercle, Brussels, 18 June 2010 Introduction I would like to thank the organisers of this conference for inviting me to present a euro area perspective on the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.74,0)">I often have the impression that people living in this area see what is happening in their countries and in the monetary union differently from many other people around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And these differences are as surprising to us in continental Europe as they are to those outside it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Just to give an example, a US academic recently visiting the ECB in Frankfurt admitted quite openly his surprise at finding our own staff so convinced that the euro will survive this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">I must admit that I was surprised, if not shocked, to hear this scholar’s admission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">After all, most US citizens believe that the dollar will survive the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.21,0)">And rightly so, because few expect the US to cease to exist as a political entity because of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.52,0)">The euro area is not a political union in the same way as the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But neither is it just an exchange rate mechanism that a country can join and leave at its own convenience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.29,0)">But then what is exactly the euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">I hope you can give an answer by the end of this talk, at least implicitly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I won’t get into an existential discussion but I’ll try to explain what has happened in recent months and what we can expect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Allow me to do that by asking a few questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.93,0)">What went wrong?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.45,0)">How was it dealt with?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.0,0)">What’s the alternative?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Will the response work?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.67,0)">Why was it so complicated?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.86,0)">What’s missing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.78,0)">There are two distinct parts to this analysis and sometimes they get mixed up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The first relates to specific developments in member countries, in particular Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The second concerns the overall architecture of monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.64,0)">In considering these two aspects, and how they interact, we should not forget that we are currently in the midst of the deepest economic and financial crisis since WWII, a crisis not foreseen when the euro was conceived.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.93,0)">What went wrong?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.08,0)">Several things went wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.69,0)">The most important one was that until the crisis erupted, Greece hadn’t really pursued sound fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">And yet its overall public debt as a percentage of GDP was not ballooning, largely as a result of an unsustainable economic growth, fuelled by rising private debt, financed through capital inflows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.45,0)">On top of this, in 2009 Greece’s deficit more than doubled as a result of the global crisis and, gravely, because of an inflated and falsified pre-election budget.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.57,0)">Unlike countries which have their own currency, Greece cannot use monetary policy to inflate its debt away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Nor can it depreciate its currency to recoup lost competitiveness and grow its way out of its excessive debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.08,0)">Unlike any region of a federal country, Greece cannot benefit from fiscal transfers from the rest of the euro area to offset its falling revenues and rising social expenditures linked to the recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Neither is its labour mobile enough for any excess to be exported.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Greece is primarily responsible for this situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.77,0)">However, since it is affecting the rest of the euro area, the other countries should have done something to prevent Greece getting into such a predicament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.79,0)">Why didn’t they?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.92,0)">The euro’s institutional architecture envisaged this kind of problem as being subject to a number of disciplinary mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.93,0)">First, financial markets should have put pressure on countries with excessive deficits and debts by charging higher interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The prohibition of monetary financing by the central bank and the no-bail-out clause aimed to strengthen these mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.99,0)">Second, the Stability and Growth Pact should have constrained national authorities through procedures and rules aimed at avoiding excessive deficits and debts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Third, the Lisbon process should have increased the competitiveness of the economies of the Member States, avoiding excessive external imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.35,0)">These mechanisms didn’t work as expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">First, financial markets accommodated the high financing requirements of Greece’s public and private sectors for many years at relatively low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.35,0)">Only when the crisis exploded did the markets react, by suddenly stopping the capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.22,0)">The contagion to other countries of the euro area, with problems of a similar kind but on a smaller scale, was very rapid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.21,0)">Second, the Stability and Growth Pact was not effective, because Member States have been unwilling to name and shame each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.34,0)">Often they interpreted the rules in a benign way, not only for countries with a high but unsustainable growth rate but also for the largest ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.8,0)">Both the preventive and corrective arms of the Pact failed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.82,0)">Finally, surveillance of competitive positions was very weak and divergences in countries’ external positions were underestimated and considered to be benign in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.46,0)">To sum up, it was both a conceptual and political failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.14,0)">The nature of it was not that different from the regulatory failure in financial markets, which resulted from an excessive optimism in the self-correcting nature of markets and an incapacity to supervise and regulate parts of the economy which had become very powerful both economically and politically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The analogy is relevant because it emphasises, in both cases, the need to address not only the short-term problems caused by the failure but also the longer-term institutional dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.23,0)">How was the problem dealt with?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">There were basically two options for tackling the problem created by the Greek crisis: what I would call Plan A and Plan B.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me start with Plan A, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">the tried-and-tested way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Plan A consists of Greece implementing a fiscal and structural adjustment programme which would bring the budget and the debt under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This plan was negotiated with the IMF, the European Commission and the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">It aims to bring the primary balance from a deficit of around 9% of GDP in 2009, to a surplus of around 6% in 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The programme is a standard IMF programme from the budgetary point of view, based on substantial expenditure cuts and revenue increases as well as improvements in revenue collection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">It has also some important structural reforms aimed not only at improving long-run debt sustainability, like a pension reform, but also the performance of labour and products markets and thus strengthen growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The projected GDP growth rate starts with a recession of -4% in 2010 and -2.6% in 2011, and returns to positive growth in 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.27,0)">The public debt is expected to stabilise, in proportion to GDP, in 2013 at a level of 149% of GDP and start falling thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The Greek programme is financed by a stand-by arrangement from the IMF, accompanied by bilateral loans by the 15 other euro area countries, for a total amount of €110 billion, which is equivalent to 46% of Greece’s GDP in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">It’s the largest IMF financial package, in proportion to a country’s quota.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Funds will be disbursed according to a specific timetable, linked to the monitoring of the implementation of the programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.36,0)">The spreading of the Greek crisis to the other countries in the euro area was addressed by a tightening of the stability programmes of countries with higher debt and deficits and with accumulated competitiveness losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Additional measures have been taken in several countries, in particular Portugal and Spain, to ensure that the targets set for 2010 are reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.56,0)">Furthermore, the targets for the 2011 deficit have been revised downwards and measures have been announced to achieve these targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">Finally, a European Financial Stability Fund has been created, based on existing funds amounting to €60 billion and on additional government guarantees of €440 billion and an expected contribution from the IMF of up to €250 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Overall, the European Fund can mobilise €750 billion to support any other country that embarks on an adjustment programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.0,0)">What’s the alternative?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.07,0)">There is widespread scepticism among academics, financial market participants and observers about whether Plan A will work, particularly in the case of Greece, because it is too harsh, it imposes too many restrictions and would ultimately be politically unsustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.15,0)">Plan A is for countries with liquidity problems, while Greece – they argue – has solvency problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.76,0)">If Plan A is not viable, there is only one alternative – Plan B. It’s not very clear what Plan B is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Some regard it as an ‘orderly’ debt restructuring by Greece, with a substantial haircut for bondholders which would alleviate the country’s debt burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">A further elaboration of Plan B also entails a return to the national currency – the drachma – with a devaluation which would allow competitiveness to be restored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.09,0)">The consequences of Plan B have not been considered in detail by its proponents, but this is considered as a secondary issue, to be assessed at a later stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.63,0)">That’s the main reason for the difference of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.22,0)">Those who have seriously studied Plan B, in all its details, know that it is not only much harsher for the people of Greece, and for the other European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.59,0)">What’s more, it doesn’t work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.31,0)">And because Plan B doesn’t work Plan A is the only viable solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me elaborate on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">First, experience has shown clearly that within an economically integrated area like the euro area a currency devaluation does not allow a growth stimulus that would support faster fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.53,0)">The countries which devalued their currencies - as Italy did after leaving the ERM in September 1992 - suffered large interest rate spreads for a protracted period, because of renewed uncertainty about the monetary regime after the devaluation as well as about the fiscal system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.51,0)">After each devaluation, inflationary risks rapidly appeared, which required more monetary tightening than would be the case within the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In fact, several countries, like Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands, implemented their fiscal consolidation programmes while maintaining a stable exchange rate and a high primary budget surplus  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.0,0)">Another aspect that is often ignored is that the return to a national currency is not an event comparable to a change in parity in a pegged exchange rate regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.75,0)">It would involve a renegotiation of all contracts, especially financial ones, within individual countries and between residents of different countries, with conflicting interests between debtors and creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.77,0)">In the event of legal disputes the international courts would be inclined to rule against the country which had decided to change its currency of denomination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.48,0)">This means that residents of that country would be severely affected by a change in the denomination of their contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.81,0)">A debtor country which imports capital from the rest of the euro area and devalues its currency would immediately suffer from an increase in its debt burden, which would exacerbate its difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.25,0)">The country would probably suffer from an attempt by the population to maintain the euro as a unit of account and means of exchange, leading to parallel circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.88,0)">To sum up, given the financial and economic integration achieved over recent years in the euro area, the possibilities voiced by some about a country abandoning the euro or about reconstituting the euro area in a reduced form would have highly detrimental effects on everyone, be they net creditors or debtors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.22,0)">It would be in nobody’s interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.69,0)">Even without leaving the euro area, a debt restructuring which would entail a substantial haircut for bondholders would hammer the domestic financial system and have serious repercussions on the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.32,0)">As many countries which have undergone a restructuring in the past know well, access to capital markets would be impaired for many years, affecting not only the government but the whole country, with severe effects on the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.31,0)">Finally, a restructuring would also have major political consequences if the loans made by the other euro area countries were not repaid in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.16,0)">Greece’s access to the Cohesion Funds would most probably be called into question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.41,0)">To sum up, Plan B would not put Greece in a sustainable position for the long term and would have a lasting economic impact on society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.79,0)">Greece would end up being politically marginalised in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.18,0)">The Greeks authorities know this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.87,0)">Plan B would also have strong contagion effects on the other countries, starting from those with weaker fiscal positions, inside and outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Such contagion effects have already materialised to some extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Plan A is preferable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">All parties involved, both in Greece and in the euro area, have a strong incentive to ensure that it works.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Will it work?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.65,0)">It’s probably not enough to say that Plan B is worse than Plan A merely to ensure that the latter works.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.88,0)">Ultimately Plan A is quite tough, especially in the case of Greece, but also for all the other countries which are embarking on austerity measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.08,0)">There are two types of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.47,0)">The first is that these programmes are not economically sustainable and create a perverse debt spiral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.87,0)">The second is that they are not politically sustainable and will cause the respective population to ultimately give up and adopt Plan B as the default.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me examine both issues in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">First, let me consider the economic feasibility of the Plan A type of action, based on restoring fiscal sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me start with some general considerations, and then turn to the specific case of Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">An analysis of the economic sustainability of any fiscal retrenchment is based on the economic impact of a restrictive budgetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.8,0)">There is currently much discussion on the Keynesian and non-Keynesian effects of fiscal retrenchment, but I do not wish to go into that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I will nevertheless make two comments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.52,0)">First, the theory that a fiscal retrenchment leads to an increase – rather than to a decrease – in the debt-to-GDP ratio is extreme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I have seen no empirical results confirming this, at least for industrial countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.25,0)">A restrictive fiscal policy might well have a negative impact on growth, but not to the point of generating a perverse debt spiral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Experience has shown that countries with a significant primary surplus can still grow over time, bringing down the debt burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Perverse debt results can be obtained in specific cases which are typical of emerging countries, where the debt is denominated in foreign currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.98,0)">Under these circumstances, low growth makes the exchange rate unsustainable, and the more the exchange rate depreciates the more the debt burden rises, making it untenable as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.53,0)">This was the experience of Argentina, which defaulted on its debt, although it was quite modest in relation to GDP  , but it was denominated in dollars, while the peg of the peso to the dollar had become untenable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.51,0)">The second comment that I would like to make is that the whole discussion about the recessionary effects of fiscal retrenchments is flawed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It is like comparing apples with pears.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The analysis often includes a baseline scenario describing an economy growing at a given pace but with an unsustainable fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.3,0)">When a restrictive budget path is plugged into the simulation, growth decreases, at least in the short term, because of standard Keynesian effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.85,0)">But the problem is that financial markets are totally excluded from the exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The baseline scenario assumes that a country can have an unsustainable fiscal policy for a long time without the financial markets reacting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.7,0)">Reality has proved this kind of model wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.34,0)">An unsustainable fiscal policy will, sooner or later, receive the attention of financial markets; they tend to react abruptly, generating a crisis which impacts heavily on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.69,0)">At that point the fiscal adjustment required to restore debt sustainability is much harsher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.71,0)">In fact, a well-designed baseline scenario should include a sharp contraction in growth at a certain point in time, due to the unsustainability of the debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">A timely fiscal adjustment which puts debt dynamics back onto a sustainable path entails a stronger growth over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.31,0)">Comparing the two scenarios would show that the expansionary and uncontrolled fiscal policy scenario is recessionary, not the timely adjustment one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.78,0)">The problem is that our economic models do not incorporate any relationship between fiscal sustainability and financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">They tend to wish it away, believing that economies can grow for ever even if their fiscal position is unsustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.81,0)">These models lead to major mistakes in assessing policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.49,0)">This affects not only policy-makers but also market participants and rating agencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Greece is a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.95,0)">The Greek government delayed for many months the measures needed to regain control over the budget, because of fears that it would impair growth prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Had Greece taken these measures earlier and avoided the financial crisis, growth would have probably been lower than the one projected at that time  , but certainly higher than the one expected now    .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.99,0)">In addition, the fiscal adjustment would probably have been milder, and the loss of market access would have been avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.59,0)">This suggests that a non-adjustment scenario is much worse for growth than an adjustment scenario, especially if the latter is timely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.52,0)">However, when rating agencies assess sovereign debt, they tend to use the same reasoning as the incorrect models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">The solvency risk of a country which has implemented a fiscal correction should be lower than if it hasn’t followed that path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.49,0)">Strangely enough, Greece’s rating was not lowered because of government inaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.94,0)">In fact, the downgrading occurred after the fiscal package was approved and implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">As far as the Greek recovery programme is concerned, the forecasts are based on the fact that Greece will implement, as part of the programme, some important structural reforms which will substantially improve the competitiveness of its economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The first full review by the IMF will take place at the end of August.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Yesterday the IMF, European Commission and ECB released a joint communiqué on the interim review mission, indicating that the Greek programme was on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.67,0)">Why was it so complicated?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.04,0)">The other argument for casting doubt on the feasibility of Plan A is political.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.85,0)">According to some, the people of the advanced economies are not ready to accept tough fiscal retrenchment which would challenge their ‘acquired rights’ or perceived entitlements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.55,0)">It would stir public unrest, leading by default to Plan B. I am not a political expert.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.51,0)">But I have some doubts about the expertise of some self- proclaimed pundits who come up with catastrophic predictions about the way our political systems work, especially when faced with a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.34,0)">What has certainly been the case in the recent crisis is that many policy decisions have been taken far too late.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.69,0)">There is no doubt that in many of our industrial countries the ruling political classes often do not have the knowledge, let alone the willpower, to explain to their citizens the need for restrictive fiscal measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.64,0)">Measures are necessary not only because of the crisis but also because of an ageing population and lower potential growth rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">These would increase the burden on the future generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.61,0)">As somebody once said, “there is no constituency for budget discipline”, because people have difficulty realising the medium-term dangers of unsustainable fiscal positions; they only do so when a crisis is imminent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.14,0)">The recent crisis has shown that consensus in societies on tough and unpleasant actions is reached only when a crisis is looming, especially a financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Governments have to ‘use’ an impending crisis to justify and gain support for tough action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.81,0)">President Bush had to declare on television that “our entire economy is in danger” to gain Congressional approval of the TARP, to support the US financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The threat hanging over the euro was used in the euro area to garner support for the financial package for Greece from national parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Explicit references to the financial markets have been made in several euro area countries in order to push through additional budgetary restraints or to adopt major reforms in the labour or financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.45,0)">The bond market spread has become the main enemy, and the main rationale for tough policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The threat of financial crisis seems to overcome any internal opposition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.81,0)">Why is this?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.04,0)">The reason seems to be that in many countries the people know that in the event of crisis Plan B would have very damaging consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.55,0)">Governments, businesses and citizens remember the devastating effects of devaluations, debt restructuring and capital controls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.57,0)">This is not to say that the decision to carry out fiscal retrenchment is easily accepted by citizens, but it seems to be easier if they see something even worse on the way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.86,0)">This strategy might be more difficult to pursue in countries where there is no recent memory of a financial crisis and a lower awareness of its negative impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.4,0)">Some might harbour the illusion that the crisis will pass them by and only affect their neighbours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.04,0)">In today’s post-Lehman world with its dense network of economic and financial systems, that is indeed an illusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.86,0)">What’s missing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I have focused so far on the measures taken to address the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">They show that the political authorities are committed to implementing whatever is necessary to overcome the crisis within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.76,0)">Plan A is the only viable solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.39,0)">However, this crisis has also exposed the weaknesses in the institutional framework underlying the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Restoring confidence in the currency also requires strengthening that framework so as to prevent any recurrence of a crisis like the one in Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">There is broad agreement on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Steps have been taken to strengthen the euro area’s institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">A task force chaired by the EU President Van Rompuy will make concrete proposals to the Heads of State and Government by the end of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">The discussion is ongoing and the ECB is participating actively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.69,0)">Its position was made public yesterday.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">To sum up, we favour: stronger independent surveillance of the budgetary policies of the Member States, with more automatic implementation of the sanctions; an improved framework for competitiveness surveillance to ensure that countries continue to converge their economies, particularly within the euro area, so as to avoid the large imbalances of the past; a crisis management framework with strong conditionality to support countries which implement adjustment programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The details of our position can be seen in the published document.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me just add two comments on issues which have been part of the public debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.5,0)">The first is on the possibility to expel a non-compliant Member State.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.61,0)">This is not consistent with the political construction underlying the euro, and ultimately not a credible threat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.23,0)">Again, the euro is not an exchange rate mechanism that you can enter or exit when you want or when pressured by others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.04,0)">The second comment is on debt restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Several commentators are proposing to include ‘orderly’ debt restructuring mechanisms to force countries to comply with the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.01,0)">The problem with this is that it is non-specific, as the debate which took place few years ago in the IMF on sovereign debt restructuring mechanisms showed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">There is no such a thing as an ‘orderly’ debt restructuring, especially for advanced economies integrated in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.51,0)">Those who propose it just assume that it exists, but forget to specify its functioning and its implications, particularly in terms of contagion to the whole financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.17,0)">It makes me think of the joke about how economists lost in the desert can open a can of beans without a can opener: they assume to have one!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The work of the Van Rompuy task force was discussed yesterday by the European Council and will continue until the autumn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">I am confident that a constructive result will be achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I would just like to mention a parallel reform which has been discussed over the past year and is currently under review by both the Council and the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">It concerns the reform of the regulatory and supervisory infrastructure in the EU, notably through the creation of three European supervisory authorities     and the European Systemic Risk Board  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.12,0)">The two issues may look separate, but they are not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.26,0)">The recent escalation of the crisis has shown that sovereign risk can have an impact on financial institutions, in particular on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.3,0)">Furthermore, given the interconnectedness of the financial system, especially in the euro area, problems in one country are likely to affect the others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.31,0)">In particular, doubts about the soundness of banks in one country can spread to banks in the other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.56,0)">The problems in one country thus cannot be tackled in isolation from the rest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The recent developments in the financial crisis call for a further strengthening of the ESAs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">They should be able to react quickly to critical situations in any of the Member States, pressing the national authorities to take action to identify and remedy problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.24,0)">If rules and procedures are needed to constrain national fiscal authorities, especially within the euro area, why shouldn’t they also constrain national supervisors?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.69,0)">The fact that national taxpayers ultimately bear the cost of national bailouts, notably resulting from supervisory failures, is a pretext for maintaining national prerogatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.28,0)">National taxpayers have too often had to pay also for supervisory failures in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.74,0)">In an interconnected financial system supervisors cannot wait for a crisis to emerge before tackling it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.22,0)">When a crisis occurs in one country, it will produce contagion effects on the others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This is why supervisors should be independent enough to act pre-emptively, without waiting for the crisis to galvanise politicians into action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The reforms of the supervisory and fiscal policy infrastructures in the euro area are interconnected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">They are mutually dependent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">We now have a unique opportunity to make a quantum leap in European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This will not be to the detriment of taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">On the contrary, it will ensure that they suffer less in any future crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.31,0)">The bottom line The current economic and financial crisis – the worst since WWII – has affected the global economy and is affecting the functioning of the European institutions, in particular those underlying the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.74,0)">During the last few months a series of shock have hit the euro area which could undermine it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.4,0)">Some people have forecast its demise – prematurely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.93,0)">The reality is different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The euro area institutions and countries have responded, challenge after challenge, with concrete measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Strong fiscal adjustment packages have been adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Unprecedented structural measures have been announced and in some cases implemented, not least the decision to coordinate and publish the results of stress tests for the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Financial support has been provided to a specific country and through a new institutional mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Concrete proposals to strengthen the governance of the euro area are being discussed and will be approved by the end of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.81,0)">One could say that these measures have been taken at a late stage and only under the pressure of markets, and following much public discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">But this is ultimately what happens in democracies, and the fact that market pressure is back in the game and playing a role in disciplining countries is, after all, in line with the way the euro was constructed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.52,0)">These market pressures are exerted on the Member States because markets have confidence that the ECB will not inflate the problems away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the euro area, fiscal problems have to be addressed by the fiscal authorities, through fiscal measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Growth and competitiveness problems have to be addressed through structural reforms, not easy money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.51,0)">This might be considered by some as a sign of weakness in the short run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">But in fact it is a sign of strength in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">If the euro area and its members continue to design and build the right adjustment policies over the coming months, they will emerge from this crisis stronger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">What the institutional framework of the euro area will look like in the near future is difficult to say.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.28,0)">We should not make the mistake of reasoning by analogy and assume that unless the euro area resembles a fully federal system like the US it is bound to fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Rather, we should take inspiration from Europe’s history and in particular from the periods when it was flourishing, in fact more so than some larger and monolithic states, which are sometimes more prone to make mistakes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Europe needs a mix of cooperation and competition among its members, something that is not easy to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">To be sure, the euro area needs more cooperation, especially in defending its common interests at a global level, but not to the point of eliminating competition, which is, after all, one of the strongest incentives for growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">If the euro area wants to grow at a stronger pace – and it needs to in order to play a role in the global economy – the solutions cannot all come from the centre, but have to rely on the prerogatives of the Member States and the policies which are still in their hands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">This has been Europe’s key strength over the centuries and will continue to be in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.05,0)">The three authorities are: the European Banking Authority, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, and the European Securities and Markets Authority.</span>
