    <span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)"> Presentation of the ECB’s Annual Report 2006 to the European Parliament Introductory Statement by Jean-Claude TrichetPresident of the European Central Bankto the European ParliamentStrasbourg, 11 July 2007 Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et messieurs les députés, J’ai l’honneur de vous présenter aujourd’hui le Rapport annuel de la BCE pour l’année 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Le Rapport annuel constitue un des outils principaux de la BCE pour rendre compte aux citoyens de l’Europe et à ses représentants élus – le Parlement européen – de sa politique monétaire et de ses activités dans les autres domaines de sa compétence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Ich werde Ihnen zunächst einen kurzen Überblick über die wirtschaftlichen und geldpolitischen Entwicklungen im Jahr 2006 geben und die geldpolitischen Maßnahmen der EZB erläutern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Danach möchte ich einige Anmerkungen zur Finanzmarktstabilität sowie zum Thema Zahlungsverkehrsysteme machen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Economic and monetary issues In 2006 the ECB’s monetary policy continued to anchor medium and long-term inflation expectations at levels consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This reflected the credibility of the ECB in conducting its monetary policy, in full compliance with its primary objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The solid anchoring of longer-term inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job creation in the euro area, in line with Article 105   of the EC Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In 2006 the euro area economy expanded at the highest growth rate since 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Notwithstanding the impact of high and volatile oil prices, real GDP rose by 2.9% in 2006, compared with 1.5% in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The economic recovery gradually broadened in the course of 2006, and the nature of the economic expansion became increasingly self sustaining, with domestic demand acting as the main driver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Despite some moderation, the ongoing strong momentum in economic growth continued in the first quarter of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The euro area continued to benefit from the robust ongoing expansion of the world economy, while substantial gains in corporate profits and an extended period of very favourable financing conditions supported investment growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Consumption growth observed a gradual recovery, in line with improving conditions in the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The latest data and survey releases have remained broadly positive, supporting the view that economic activity in the euro area in the second quarter of 2007 continued to expand at solid rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Looking ahead, the medium-term outlook for economic activity remains favourable and the conditions are in place for the euro area economy to continue to grow at a sustained rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">As regards the external environment, global economic growth remains robust, while domestic demand in the euro area is also expected to maintain its relatively strong momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The risks surrounding this favourable medium-term outlook for economic growth are broadly balanced over the shorter term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.51,0)">At medium to longer horizons, risks remain on the downside, owing mainly to external factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.76,0)">Regarding price developments, average annual HICP inflation in 2006 was 2.2%, unchanged compared with the previous year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">This was slightly above the ECB’s aim to keep inflation over the medium term below, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.26,0)">Although this outcome mainly reflects increases in oil and commodity prices, and although inflation has been slightly below 2% in the first half of 2007, there is no room for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The outlook for price stability over the medium term remains subject to upside risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.73,0)">As capacity utilisation in the euro area economy is high and labour markets are gradually improving, constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to stronger than expected wage developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In addition, pricing power in market segments with low competition may increase in such an environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.07,0)">The Governing Council stresses the importance of avoiding wage developments that would eventually lead to inflationary pressures and harm the purchasing power of all euro area citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.86,0)">In addition, upside risks to price stability arise from increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those anticipated thus far and the potentially pro-cyclical stance of fiscal policy in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.58,0)">Finally, on the external side, upside risks stem from the possibility of further unexpected oil price rises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">The Governing Council’s assessment that upside risks to price stability prevailed has been confirmed throughout the period from the start of 2006 to mid 2007 by cross-checking with the monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.79,0)">The marked dynamism of monetary and credit growth in 2006 reflected a continuation of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion in the euro area that has been observed since mid-2004, adding further to liquidity accumulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Also in 2007, the underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong, as reflected in the continued rapid growth of M3 as well as the still high level of credit growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Following several years of robust monetary growth and the continued vigour of the ongoing expansion in money and credit, liquidity in the euro area remains ample.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">In this environment, there are clear indications of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer-term horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Therefore, monetary developments continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the background of the expansion in economic activity and still strong property market developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">To address the upside risks to price stability identified by the ECB’s economic and monetary analyses, the Governing Council has adjusted the monetary policy stance gradually in eight steps since the end of 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As a result, the minimum bid rate in the main refinancing operations of the Eurosystem rose from 2.00% in December 2005 to 4.00% in June 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">After the adjustments in the key interest rates, the ECB’s monetary policy remains still on the accommodative side, with overall financing conditions favourable, money and credit growth vigorous, and liquidity in the euro area ample.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Looking forward, firm and timely action continues to be warranted to ensure price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">The Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments in order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Fiscal policies As regards fiscal policies, the ECB shares the view expressed in the draft resolution that fiscal consolidation is key and all the more necessary in good times in order to achieve long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">In a benign environment, budget balances in 2006 were generally better than expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">It is imperative that forthcoming budget plans build on this favourable outcome, assigning higher than expected revenues to deficit reduction and speeding up progress towards the achievement of medium-term budgetary objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.15,0)">The ECB is concerned about recent developments which point to a relaxation of fiscal targets in some countries, the aforementioned risk of pro-cyclical policies and a repetition of past policy mistakes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">It is imperative that all governments comply with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact on fiscal consolidation and that all the countries concerned honour the commitments made at the Eurogroup meeting in Berlin on 20 April 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">As agreed in Berlin, taking advantage of the favourable cyclical conditions would enable most euro area countries to achieve their medium-term objectives in 2008 or 2009, and all of them should aim for 2010 at the latest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">These pledges should be reflected in the 2008 budget plans so as to avoid repeating governments’ past failure to adjust fiscal balances in economic “good times”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The Governing Council also welcomes the emphasis placed by the ECOFIN Council on measures to improve the quality and efficiency of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.18,0)">Economic differentials in the euro area and structural policies Turning to structural policies, the draft resolution adopted by the ECON Committee refers several times to economic divergences in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.29,0)">I should like to stress first that, overall, inflation differences among euro area countries have fallen and are currently relatively limited by historical standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.9,0)">The magnitude of current inflation and output differentials is similar to that observed across regions or states within the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.79,0)">These differentials can be considered normal to the extent that they reflect catching-up phenomena or country-specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.14,0)">However, inflation differentials tend to be rather persistent in the euro area, and they reflect in part persistent differences in unit labour cost developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.6,0)">In addition, the variation of output growth across some euro area countries can largely be attributed to differences in potential output growth rather than in business cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.71,0)">In a number of cases, this may reflect existing rigidities in product and labour markets and a lack of competition, leading to sluggish adjustment processes and a restrained growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.59,0)">It is very important to monitor the accumulated competitiveness losses in some of the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A more comprehensive analysis of the sources and implications of these differentials, as requested in your draft resolution, has already been provided in our Monthly Bulletin of April this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A single currency means a single monetary policy and a single exchange rate vis-à-vis other currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">It is therefore all the more important to ensure that all the national mechanisms of adjustment to shocks function perfectly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">The efficient and smooth functioning of economic adjustments within the euro area requires the removal of institutional barriers to flexible wage and price-setting mechanisms as well as the completion of the Single Market and thus greater cross-border competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Indeed, well-designed structural reforms implemented by national governments are crucial to improve the functioning of product, labour and financial markets and to reinforce competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Increased market competition and a reduction of cross-border barriers are beneficial for consumers since they lead to lower prices, higher real wages and a greater choice of products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">They are also beneficial for firms since they lead to higher efficiency, greater dynamism and an enhanced capacity to cope with economic shocks and to face the challenges and opportunities posed by globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Free and undistorted competition fosters long-term economic growth and job creation and facilitates the maintenance of price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">The completion of the Single Market must therefore be a priority for all of us, in particular as regards further financial market integration, the pursuit of effective competition in the energy market and the implementation of the Services Directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Financial stability Mister President, honourable members of the European Parliament, let me now address some financial stability issues, in particular the ECB’s view on hedge funds and leverage buyouts, both of which continue to remain at the forefront of financial market activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The ECB acknowledges the positive role that hedge funds play by contributing to enhancing the efficiency and liquidity of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.32,0)">We should be aware, however, that hedge funds can represent also a source of risk to the stability of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.03,0)">This can take place through two main channels, notably the possible effects on investors and counterparties, primarily banks, and the potential impact on financial markets and particularly derivative markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.89,0)">Concerning the latter, it is not fully clear what could be the impact of hedge funds’ behaviour on the liquidity of financial markets in a stress situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Against this background, the report issued in May 2007 by the Financial Stability Forum on High-leveraged institutions is welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The report concluded that, while the so-called indirect regulation of hedge funds through their regulated counterparties, foremost banks, remains the most adequate approach for containing potential risks to financial stability, the effectiveness of this approach cannot be taken for granted and needs to be monitored regularly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Therefore, the report contains a number of recommendations addressed to supervisors, hedge funds’ counterparties and investors, and the hedge fund industry itself, which I fully share.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">As for the role to be played by the industry, more than ever I will support the proposal that the hedge fund sector would strive for best practices and that industry-led benchmarks would be a suitable tool to pursue this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">In this vein, the recent initiative undertaken by the industry to set up a working group to review best practices is a very welcome development and I look forward to the result of such work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">My second point concerns private equity and leveraged buyout   activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">This activity has been booming in Europe – also as a consequence of abundant market liquidity – and has seen an increasing involvement of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">In a recent study on large banks’ involvement in the LBO market in the EU, which was conducted by the Banking Supervision Committee and published by the ECB, banks’ debt exposures were assessed as being manageable with respect to their capital buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.39,0)">However, the study identified so-called warehousing risk as a significant risk to which banks are becoming exposed through LBO-related activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This risk arises from the material amounts of LBO debt that underwriting banks take on, with the aim of distributing it into the market shortly after the transactions are completed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The efficacy of these risk distribution processes strongly rely on the effectiveness of syndication processes and the degree of liquidity in credit risk transfer   markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">I consider that the warehousing risks faced by banks start to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Payment systems My final remarks concern the integration of payment systems in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">I noted with satisfaction the positive assessment you made in the draft resolution about the Single Euro Payments Area and the Target 2 project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">The Eurosystem will continue to play its role in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">As for the Target2-securities   project, the draft resolution shares the Eurosystem’s assessment that this project might have the potential to foster the integration, the efficiency and the safety of the clearing and settlement infrastructure in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">At the same time, the draft resolution notes that an appropriate governance structure is of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">As for the latter point, we have always wished to have a strong involvement of the markets in the T2S project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">We have put in place a governance model for the development phase which seeks to involve all stakeholders through the creation of an Advisory Group on T2S where markets players are well represented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.89,0)">The “Advisory Group” – which reports directly to the ECB Executive Board and Governing Council – is composed for about two thirds by market participants and only one third by central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Hence, strong interaction between the ECB and the markets takes place on a continuous basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">On 26 April 2007, the ECB Governing Council launched an official public consultation on the principles and proposals underlying the T2S Project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">The 2-month public consultation launched by the ECB is now finalised, and the market feedback is very useful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">We received quite a high number of comments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">A first preliminary assessment of these comments shows that their feedback is generally rather positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Out of 67 proposals, we have obtained a total of 3200 remarks from 56 institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">67% of these 3200 remarks indicated full agreement to the proposals, while only 6% indicated full disagreement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">All the feedback received has been published   and is being carefully considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The governance of T2S is of special importance for us and thus an important element of our work programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">My colleague, Mrs Tumpel-Gugerell and Mr Godeffroy, Director-General Payment Systems and Market Infrastructure, have made presentations before the Parliament this year to present the case for T2S and inform on the governance for T2S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The governance arrangements for the next phases of the project will be discussed in the coming months and the EP will be kept fully informed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">I thank you very much for your attention.</span>
