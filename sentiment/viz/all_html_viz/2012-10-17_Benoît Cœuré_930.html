    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.78,0)"> What can monetary policy do about inequality?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, Intergroup “Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, Fourth World Committee” event, European Parliament, Brussels, 17 October 2012 Members of the European Parliament, Professor Banerjee, ladies and gentlemen,   I would like to thank the European Parliament for inviting me to participate in this panel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Economic growth has sharply reduced the incidence of poverty in “developed” economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">In Europe, it is one of the great achievements of the Single Market and of Economic and Monetary Union   to have delivered growth and job creation over a prolonged period, contributing to this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.8,0)">The euro area has created about 14.4 million new jobs since 1999, compared with approximately 10.7 million in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.98,0)">Nevertheless, the past five years have been a time of hardship, owing to the financial and economic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.45,0)">The Great Recession of 2008-09 and the subsequent crisis in the euro area have dented growth in our economies, pushing millions of workers into unemployment or forced inactivity, and adversely affecting living standards for our entire population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.49,0)">Moreover, they have left a shadow of uncertainty over long-term growth prospects and run the risk of creating a lost generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I would like to bring to this discussion a central banker’s perspective on the theme of inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.55,0)">Inequality is a cause for concern for all European institutions, since social cohesion is one of the statutory objectives of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.77,0)">For the ECB, the question naturally arises as to whether monetary policy can make a difference, and whether it is mandated to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Musgrave and Musgrave’s traditional description of the functions of economic policy   can help to explain the role of monetary policy in the economic constitution of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The task of the ECB under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union is to ensure price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It thus focuses on income and wealth stabilisation rather than on the allocation of economic resources, or on redistribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa’s concise words, monetary policy is focused on stability rather than on efficiency or equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This should be the starting point of any discussion of the role of monetary policy in addressing inequalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.99,0)">Does this imply that inequalities are irrelevant for central bankers?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Not at all, as first, monetary policy may have an impact on inequalities, and second, stability is conducive to equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">To the extent that it stabilises economic activity, monetary policy can help shield from poverty the lowest income classes of society, especially during recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I will address these two issues in turn, starting from a few facts on the rise of inequality in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">I will maintain that preserving price stability over the medium term is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to economic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The ECB has achieved this goal throughout the crisis, thanks to its standard and non-standard monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Our recent decision to undertake Outright Monetary Transactions can also be seen in this context, to the extent that it helps to restore confidence in the integrity and irreversibility of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.2,0)">Inequality/poverty is a cause for concern also in the euro area It is well known that the relationship between inequality and growth is complex and not necessarily monotonic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.09,0)">On average, inequality in developed economies has increased in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.08,0)">The Gini coefficient, a standard measure of income inequality that ranges from 0   to 1  , stood at an average of 0.29 in OECD countries in the mid-1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">By the end of the last decade, it had increased by almost 10% to 0.32.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">It rose in 17 of the 22 OECD countries for which long-term data series are available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.52,0)">Of the eight euro area countries for which we have data, inequality increased in five, changed little in two and declined in one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Thus, although incomes remain more unequally distributed in the United States, the data suggest that inequality is also on the rise in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The increase in inequality since the 1980s largely reflects a faster increase in household incomes at the top of the income distribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.84,0)">More precisely, greater inequality in labour income, which represents about three-quarters of total income across the working age population, emerges as the most important driver of household income inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.61,0)">In particular, most of the microeconomic studies find a continuous and sharp increase in wage dispersion in Anglo-Saxon countries over the last 30 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.25,0)">Microeconomic evidence is, however, mixed across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.81,0)">In countries such as Sweden and Spain, inequality has followed a downward trend over the same period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.92,0)">In Germany and Italy, the changes in wage distribution are more erratic and do not show a clear upward or downward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.78,0)">Developments in labour participation, which also affects labour income, are more heterogeneous across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.17,0)">It is also difficult to find clear patterns in developments in capital income inequality, owing to measurement difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.58,0)">How wages evolve over the business cycle depends both on the reasons why growth moves up and down, and on the way the labour market is organised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.67,0)">At first sight, a rigid labour market may appear to shield the poorest from economic shocks, as wages will not easily adjust downwards in a recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.68,0)">However, the lack of reaction of wages is a clear symptom of an ill-functioning labour market, leading to a costly and prolonged adjustment in employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.78,0)">Taking into account fluctuations in wages and unemployment, a typical finding in several countries is that inequality in earnings at the bottom of the distribution tends to rise during recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.71,0)">Moreover, households that do not receive labour income face even higher hurdles when labour markets do not function well and protect insiders at the expense of outsiders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.81,0)">What this means is that the poor suffer most in relative terms in and after a recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.68,0)">In fact, the pain they suffer does not fully disappear once the recession is over owing to the persistence of unemployment and the malfunctioning of labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.87,0)">With regard to developments since 2007, recent research finds marked differences across countries depending on whether they have also experienced large corrections in house prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.66,0)">Nevertheless, for most OECD countries for which data are available, there is thus far little evidence of changes in household income distribution in the two years following the start of the downturn, from 2007 to 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.45,0)">Once more data become available, however, larger changes can be expected over the coming years, especially in countries like Spain that suffered a severe slump in the housing market and massive job losses in the construction sector, mostly for temporary workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.73,0)">Taken together, these factors suggest that unemployment remains a crucial determinant of inequality and poverty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to support job creation and ensure that the unemployed are employable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In the global economy, the comparative advantages of European economies rest very much on human capital and skills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Active labour market policies and investment in higher education are the most powerful instruments at the disposal of governments to counter rising inequality and to foster employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This leads to a simple policy message.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">At a time when fiscal policies are being reorganised in European countries, reflecting the crucial need to restore the sustainability of public finances, it is essential that the composition of fiscal adjustment preserves governments’ ability to invest in skills and recreate comparative advantages in their economies, and that they are supported by mobilisation of EU instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.63,0)">Can monetary policy affect inequality and poverty?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">But let me now return to the contribution that the central bank itself can make to reducing inequality and poverty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.03,0)">Is there evidence that monetary policy affects inequality?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I will discuss this question from two perspectives: first, the immediate distributive effects of monetary policy and inflation; and second, the benefits of macroeconomic stability for the more vulnerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.23,0)">Because monetary policy is transmitted through many channels, direct and indirect – interest rates both current and expected, credit extension, asset prices – and because households differ in many respects – with regard to socio-demographic factors, such as age and education, as well as economic variables, such as income, wealth, employment status and housing status – monetary policy does not affect all households in the same way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.94,0)">Many channels through which monetary policy affects individuals in different ways may be at work, and it is a daunting task to disentangle and quantify these channels empirically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.39,0)">Inflation has a direct effect on income inequality through changes in the real   valuation of financial and non-financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.93,0)">Clearly, an unexpected fall in interest rates and an increase in inflation tend to hurt savers and benefit borrowers – the mechanism John Maynard Keynes referred to as the “euthanasia of the rentier”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.54,0)">Careful studies based on US data demonstrate that inflation hits in particular richer and older households, which hold the bulk of the economy’s wealth and whose asset holdings are typically imperfectly insured against surprise inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Can this evidence be interpreted as suggesting that the higher inflation is, the lower income inequality will be?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Or that higher inflation should be pursued as a way to reduce income inequality?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.31,0)">My answer is no, because inflation is also particularly harmful to the poorest parts of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.08,0)">First, poorer households tend to hold a larger fraction of their financial wealth in cash, implying that both expected and unexpected increases in inflation make them even poorer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.3,0)">In addition, monetary policy shocks and surprise inflation can have an impact on inequality through other sources of income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.75,0)">Income from labour and the unemployment of less-skilled workers tend to be adversely affected to a disproportionate degree during recessions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.12,0)">All in all, recent studies suggest that a higher inflation rate is accompanied by greater income inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.78,0)">At the same time research on the US data finds that also contractionary monetary policy actions appear to increase inequality in earnings and total income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">A stability-oriented monetary policy, which aims to smooth the cycle and reduce its amplitude, ought therefore to cushion the impact of negative shocks on poorer households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.72,0)">However, it is not only the extent of income and wealth shocks that affects consumers’ welfare, but also the fluctuation in their consumption expenditure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.42,0)">All households are not equal in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Some of them are able to insure against wealth shocks and can thus mitigate the adverse consequences of such shocks for their well-being.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.48,0)">But poorer households have limited or no access to the financial system   and do not have adequate buffers in the form of precautionary savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.47,0)">Consequently, their consumption and welfare are particularly vulnerable to adverse shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.57,0)">Even if all households were hit by negative shocks to the same extent, poorer, less-insured households would suffer from more volatile consumption and lower welfare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.46,0)">Studies of these effects have so far focused almost exclusively on the United States and their findings may not be applicable to the euro area, where countries are characterised by different tax/benefit systems and different institutions, and where households do not access financial markets in the same way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">We in the Eurosystem are aware of the need for more empirical research at the household level and, partly for this reason, we have been collecting such data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Our “Household Finance and Consumption Survey”   documents the extent of wealth heterogeneity and the structure of household balance sheets across the euro area member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">To enhance the analysis and understanding of issues such as whether and how different households react to shocks in different ways, the data will be made available to researchers in early 2013 together with a detailed public report on the results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.43,0)">Finally, it should be mentioned that monetary policy can impact geographical inequalities, insofar as it contributes to smoothing unevenly distributed shocks to households’ wealth and income across countries or regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.48,0)">The ECB’s non-standard measures, as described below, have limited the risk of negative feedback loops at country level within the euro area, arising in particular from the tight link between the creditworthiness of banks and of sovereigns, and more recently from the unjustified perception of a risk of euro break-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">To this extent, monetary policy has helped cushion the impact on the crisis on the less well-off households in jurisdictions under financial stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Price stability and economic stability: the role of ECB measures There is a broader point on the relationship between monetary policy and the fight against poverty, a point that I would like to stress now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Social equality is better served by economic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">A large body of theoretical and applied academic literature and the experience of the past decades indicate that monetary policy’s best contribution to economic stability is to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Moreover, credible central banks have a comparative advantage in this area, as the return to price stability becomes possible at lower costs in terms of output volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The available empirical evidence supports the view of a complementarity between price and economic stability at the aggregate level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Price stability appears to be conducive to economic growth, low unemployment and subdued income volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Recent developments in the main advanced economies in terms of volatility of inflation and GDP growth confirm this insight and show that there has been no trade-off between the two variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Had the unprecedented increase in the demand for liquidity following the financial crisis not been accommodated by unlimited liquidity supply from the ECB, money market rates would have increased strongly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.25,0)">A larger fall in credit growth would have ensued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.89,0)">Estimates suggest that the euro area inflation rate would have been about 1 percentage point lower and the GDP level would have been more than 2% lower by the first half of 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">From a broader perspective, our non-standard measures have prevented more adverse economic outcomes by helping in particular the euro area countries which were most affected by the crisis, and by preventing a halt in the flow of credit especially to small and medium-sized enterprises  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.54,0)">According to the latest survey conducted by the Eurosystem, in the second and third quarters of 2011 access to finance remained one of the most pressing problems for SMEs, which continue to rely mostly on banks for external financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Maintaining a flow of credit to SMEs was particularly important because they employ 72% of the euro area’s labour force and have significantly higher gross job creation   rates than large enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.84,0)">I have focused on the narrower question of whether inequality can be affected by monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">More evidence has to be collected before we can produce robust stylised facts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">However, it is clear that, by ensuring price stability over the medium term, monetary policy also contributes to broader economic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.17,0)">During recessions, it also has stabilising effects on employment and poverty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This role of monetary policy has been especially important during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.93,0)">An increase in the overall demand for liquidity by banks – when unmatched by the central bank – can cause a downward spiral in asset prices, a credit crunch, bank failures and a severe recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.52,0)">Deflation accompanies these phenomena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.43,0)">The Great Depression – a combination of recession, deflation and bank failures – is a clear historical example of what can happen if central banks fail to provide liquidity to the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The monetary policy measures taken by the ECB have helped to avoid a collapse in money and credit and to eliminate the spectre of the Great Depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">They have not only avoided a collapse of the financial system, but also, and more importantly, prevented a surge in unemployment and poverty in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In so doing, we have proven that the three objectives of stability, efficiency and equity are mutually supportive, and that the ECB can effectively contribute to containing inequalities within its Treaty mandate.</span>
