    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)"> Which models do we need in times of crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the Banque de France, CEPREMAP, Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and Centre d’Analyse Stratégique international conference on “Macroeconomic Modeling in Times of Crisis”Paris, 26 October 2012 Ladies and Gentlemen,   I would like to thank the organisers for inviting me to this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We are living in extraordinary times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Unprecedented challenges call for bold policy action, but the bolder we are, the more we need solid, principle-based policy analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.56,0)">This is all the more challenging as the crisis has also exposed weaknesses in our existing tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">This conference gives us a chance to reflect on the lessons that can be learnt and on how we can proceed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let me share a few ideas based on the ECB’s experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.68,0)">Prominent economists – Akerlof and Shiller, Buiter, Krugman and Mankiw  , as well as popular opinion   – have concluded   that the current generation of micro-founded theory-based models have somehow taken a wrong turning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Others – among them Kocherlakota, Lucas and Woodford   – have reached a more positive assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.83,0)">Others still   point less to models and more to policy: specifically, the failure to adhere to the policy rules derived from those same models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.97,0)">The truth probably lies somewhere in between.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Thus, I take the view that while we should acknowledge the contribution of our models, we must likewise acknowledge their limitations and make improvements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">It’s worth reminding ourselves where we are and what’s been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Policy interventions by the ECB, the Federal Reserve System and other central banks – lowering policy rates to historic lows and employing non-standard measures such as infinitely-elastic liquidity provision or the ECB’s new ‘Outright Monetary Transactions’ – have certainly eased financial market pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Although we are still grappling with tensions in credit and sovereign debt markets, and with the painful adjustment of our economies, the financial system is recovering and we are working hard to strengthen that process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In addition, banks are replenishing their capital buffers and the institutional foundations of the euro are being strengthened, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">through the Fiscal Compact and the forthcoming banking union, together with improved regulatory frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These decisions have not been taken in an intellectual vacuum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.57,0)">The notion that the Great Recession would have exposed fundamental flaws in economic theory can be firmly dispelled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.58,0)">It is my conviction that more than ever – and here I quote John Maynard Keynes – “madmen in authority…are distilling their frenzy from some academic scribbler from a few years back”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Economic theories, some of them dating back to the 1930s  , have helped us to incorporate financial insights tractably into our models – think of the financial accelerator, the debt deflation channel, the credit channel, the modelling of collateral-constrained and credit-constrained agents, to name but a few.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.36,0)">Therefore, saying that models had nothing to teach us about the crisis   is just not right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It’s true that we did not avoid the Great Recession, but if we, around the world, were able to prevent a much more damaging depression, we owe much of it to the science of economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.59,0)">Nevertheless, it is also true that our models did not predict the crisis and provided only limited policy guidance when it struck.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Can we identify their weaknesses?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.49,0)">Well, there are the usual suspects: linearity, rational expectations, complete markets, limited agent heterogeneity and financial imperfections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Ex ante, these choices may be defended as reflecting the need for parsimony, logical consistency and tractability in model building; perhaps also the view that financial crises were rare.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Clearly, those views need revising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.47,0)">Certainly, structural models were not very successful at forecasting the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">But I’m not certain that there were other tools out there which did better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Non-linear models are outwardly attractive – think of the strong pro-cyclical features of the current euro area crisis, such as the market impact of credit downgrades or the feedback loop between sovereign and bank creditworthiness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">But they do not necessarily deliver substantive gains in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.91,0)">Meta models or models which markedly over-fit the data are unlikely to help policy deliberations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Arguably of more importance is the better identification of those   financial factors that matter for our short-term assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me now bring the ECB’s experience into the discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">I would first like to emphasise the valuable contribution that the current generation of DSGE models have made to the policy-making process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The ECB has been at the frontier of developing and estimating structural models for policy analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Models such as Smets-Wouters   and the New Area-Wide Model     have played an important role in policy analysis  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Similarly, the Christiano-Motto-Rostagno   model represents a valuable extension of the canonical framework to explore and interpret financial linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">In recent years, at the ECB and comparable institutions, country modelling has risen in prominence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.09,0)">Smaller countries, and in particular the EU/IMF programme countries, whose impact has usually been small relative to euro area developments, have extensively contributed to increased area-wide volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">But in building and extending our models, we should be aware that there are other perspectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Behavioural economics and behavioural finance spring to mind: yes, animal spirits and herd behaviour influence market dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.32,0)">Loss aversion, rule-of-thumb, over-confidence, lumpy decision-making and pattern-seeking are characteristics long understood by behaviourists that can, with due care, illuminate many puzzling market outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">A more serious treatment of expectations is also high on the agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.5,0)">After all, information is costly both to store and to process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Hence, the cost of forming expectations has to be taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">“The macroeconomics of the future”, as Michael Woodford puts it, “will still make use of general-equilibrium models in which the behavior of households and firms is derived from considerations of inter-temporal optimality, but in which the optimization is relative to the evolving beliefs of those actors about the future, which need not perfectly coincide with the predictions of the economist’s model”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">That said, for the behavioural research agenda to migrate into the mainstream of policy analysis, one still needs a sense of concrete and novel macro policy implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.13,0)">So what’s on our modelling wish-list?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Models need to incorporate at least some of the key aspects of, and key players in, the financial crisis: financial factors and intermediaries, the shadow banking sector, the interaction between sovereign and banking solvency risks and financial interconnectedness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In order to draw the full lessons from the previous crises, it would be important to include elements such as housing markets and mortgage finance, heterogeneous agents  , richer flow of funds analysis and asset and liability structure, as well as to develop good theories of maturity transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">More generally, models should acknowledge the evolving role of money in the economy, including the determinants of inside money creation   and how it interacts with central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">But the wish-list extends beyond financial matters: a more vigorous role for fiscal policy and a more serious treatment of expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The stronger role for fiscal policy could include distortionary taxes, as well as complementarities between private and public consumption and investment expenditures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Deeper research into expectations could comprise the use of bounded rather than rational expectations, where agents learn only about economic shocks very gradually, or, more exotically, “rational inattention”, which formally recognizes the limits to agents’ information processing abilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">These points are clearly high on the agenda as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But what we don’t want on our wish-list is to include all these features in a single big model as was done in the 1960s and 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.97,0)">That would be a recipe for utter complexity and obscurity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.32,0)">It is also evident to me, as a policy-maker, that policy decisions are shaped by interactions between actors or interest groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Take the question of euro area adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Who will bear the cost of the much-needed sovereign and private deleveraging?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.3,0)">To what extent will the social cost of the crisis bear on political outcomes, and thus on economic policy decisions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">How much fiscal risk-sharing can be accepted by the people of Europe, and what should be the optimal combination of inter-temporal risk-sharing through balanced budget rules, “horizontal” risk-sharing between countries  , and “vertical” risk-sharing through a common fiscal capacity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To answer such crucial questions, we would need to plug a political economy model into a rich description of the euro area economy and financial sector, disaggregated at country level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.34,0)">We don’t have this in our toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Yet, exciting new work is already arriving – some of it presented here at this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">My hope is that these extensions will help us to understand the interaction between the balance sheets of central banks, on the one hand, and those of the private and public sectors, on the other hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">But they will also help us to grasp the determinants of inside money creation, to shed light on spillovers between residential and non-residential sectors, macro-prudential issues, and to quantify trade-offs in different policy strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">The ECB’s most recent contribution was the establishment in 2010 of the Macro-Prudential Research Network   to develop frameworks and tools to improve macro-prudential supervision in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Specifically, progress has been made on models linking financial stability and economic performance; early warning systems and systemic risk indicators; and on assessing contagion risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The view from MaRS, already distilled through a large number of papers and conferences, should constitute a critical input to those matters in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In expanding our modelling frameworks, let me insist on the merits of pragmatism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.11,0)">As Paul Krugman once said, “economists as a group mistook beauty, clad in impressive-looking mathematics, for truth”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let’s not be too easily seduced by beauty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The search, for example, for micro-foundations shouldn’t be dogmatic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As an illustration, what made Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans   and Smets and Wouters   so important is that, whilst motivated by theory, they didn’t sacrifice the empirical side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.97,0)">Short cuts were taken: habits in consumption, investment adjustment costs, indexation etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Such frictions have and can be micro-founded but the crucial, not to say bold, step was to incorporate them in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.94,0)">One might say the same of “financial frictions”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.77,0)">In times of crisis, the search for micro-foundations shouldn’t paralyse us or hinder fresh thinking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.62,0)">For instance, though rightly famous, it’s unclear if the Bernanke-Gertler-Gilchrist framework   correctly depicted recent events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.65,0)">The financial crisis looks as much like a sudden breakdown in financial intermediation which then spilled over to, and exacerbated, sovereign debt tensions, as a crisis sparked by risky corporate leverage or banks being less efficient in monitoring investment projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In effect, we should find out and emphasise what works.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Do some interest-rate spread definitions work better than others?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.75,0)">Does that information content change over time?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Do frameworks predicated on one country translate to another?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Can we understand the dynamics at play behind the fragmentation of the euro area financial system, and what it would take to reverse this trend?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.56,0)">I conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For both model-building and policy-making, the agenda is formidable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">But conferences like this highlight that some of the best minds in the profession are pursuing that agenda, and pursuing it vigorously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Even though the models at our disposal proved to be relatively inadequate to deal with the complexity of the crisis, still it is the economic framework developed so far that has guided our policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.41,0)">To put it differently, economic models have shown severe limitations, but without them, policy-makers around the world would have been condemned to complete inaction or blatantly erroneous actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Models are devices to help structure, organise and discipline our beliefs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">They help identify the key assumptions on which any policy recommendation rests, and provide an essential framework for general-equilibrium policy analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.98,0)">In economics, as in other sciences, they highlight channels of interest and abstract from other factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">They can   be tested against data, bringing our dismal science, economics, one step closer to Popperian refutability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">They also encourage the building of new data sets and decisions upon appropriate data concepts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Ultimately, they help us to learn from past errors and provide safeguards against political adventurism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As General Eisenhower once said: “In preparing for battle I have always found that plans are useless, but planning is indispensable”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.22,0)">When combating the crisis, models are sometimes useless, but modelling is indispensable.</span>
