    <span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)"> Life below zero: Learning about negative interest rates Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Presentation at the annual dinner of the ECB's Money Market Contact Group,Frankfurt am Main, 9 September 2014 Ladies and Gentlemen    , It is a pleasure to be here with you tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The Money Market Contact Group plays a key role in informing the ECB's decision making process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.65,0)">As a tribute to your collective foresight, I would like to recall that in your meeting on 25 June 2012, you were among the first to discuss the operational consequences of lowering the ECB's Deposit Facility Rate   to zero or below zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This will be the topic of my remarks tonight  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.88,0)">A few months ago, on 5 June, the ECB lowered the main refinancing rate to 0.15%, the marginal lending rate to 0.40%, and – maybe most noteworthy – the Deposit Facility Rate to minus 0.10%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.14,0)">Last week, on 4 September, these rates were cut to 0.05%, 0.30% and -0.20% respectively, and it was stated that the lower bound had now been reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The ECB also decided in June to remunerate current account balances in excess of the minimum reserve requirements at the deposit facility rate as opposed to zero as was the case previously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.69,0)">With these measures, we entered practically uncharted territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.83,0)">When Gregory Mankiw in 2009 stated in the New York Times that “it may be time   to go negative”, he revived an idea that may seem odd at first.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.66,0)">If lowering interest rates stimulates the economy and policy rates are already very low or even zero, then why not keep cutting rates and have negative interest rates?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.59,0)">The idea of negative rates, that is, lending 100 and getting back say 95, may seem absurd “but remember this: Early mathematicians thought the idea of a negative number was absurd  “.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.39,0)">In fact, the idea of negative interest rates, or “taxing money”, goes back to the late nineteenth century, to Silvio Gesell, the German founder of “Freiwirtschaft”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.1,0)">The historic academic opinion on Gesell is divided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.89,0)">Irving Fisher supported him and John Maynard Keynes called him “a strange, unduly neglected prophet”, others a “typical monetary crank”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">So where do we stand in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.27,0)">I would like to answer this question today by addressing the following points: What does it mean to have one of our policy rates, the deposit facility rate, below zero?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.33,0)">Why did we go negative?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.39,0)">What are in principle the benefits and costs of such a move?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And, with the benefit of some hindsight since June, what is the initial assessment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.18,0)">To begin with, it is important to point out that the deposit facility rate has a specific, narrow meaning: under a negative DFR, banks that have more funds in their account with the ECB than what they need to fulfil their reserve requirement lose some money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.87,0)">Suppose, for instance, that a bank has €100 million of excess reserves continuously for one year, then at an interest rate of -0.20% it receives back € 99.8 million, so the cost of depositing funds with the ECB for a full year is € 200,000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.58,0)">Why do banks accept such a cost of depositing excess reserves with the central bank?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.55,0)">The answer is that the alternatives to depositing excess reserves are also costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.82,0)">In fact, the cost of using alternatives to central bank deposits determines to what extent the rate on excess reserves can go negative in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.43,0)">Banks can always choose to hold physical currency instead of electronic money in their accounts with the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.2,0)">Since physical currency has a zero nominal rate of return, there is what I would call an “economic lower bound” for the rate on excess reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.04,0)">It is difficult to identify but it is not zero because the effective rate of return on currency is negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">One does not even need to impose a demurrage rate or regular stamping on banknotes, as Irving Fischer has proposed based on Gesell’s ideas  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There is a cost of storing, holding, and more importantly, using physical currency  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This involves the cost of renting, maintaining and securing storage facilities such as vaults as well as the cost of shipping currency around in a safe and timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A recent ECB study estimated the private cost of cash payments to be 1.1% of GDP on average in the participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The unit social cost was estimated at 2.3 cents per euro of transaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This is substantially higher than the unit social cost of a credit transfer or other non-cash means of payments per euro of transaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.37,0)">Because the overnight unsecured money market alone currently involves hundreds of banks with an aggregate transaction volume of around € 40-50 billion every day, replicating this scale of transacting with physical money would be a formidable and costly task, both privately and socially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">I would not go as far as Kenneth Rogoff and conclude that having only electronic money, by pushing down the economic lower bound, would recreate room for manoeuvre for central banks in a protractedly low inflation environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The ECB is committed to bringing euro area inflation back at a level below but close to 2%, in line with its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.61,0)">But what is then the rationale for a negative rate on the deposit facility?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.05,0)">Why impose a cost on banks’ excess reserves?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">One should view the negative rate in the context of the ECB’s aim to provide further monetary policy accommodation inter alia by lowering policy rates without impairing market intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">There are a number of reasons why it is desirable to keep a certain distance between the main refinancing and the deposit rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The relative difference between the cost of borrowing from the ECB and the benefit of depositing with the ECB determines the incentive to lend in the interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Having an active interbank market is important to obtain price signals about the transmission of policy rates into the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">It is also important to reduce bank excessive reliance on central bank money, which has been a key factor of resilience in the post-crisis environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.93,0)">In the words of Michael Woodford, “the demand for   is a function of the location of the overnight rate relative to the lending rate and the deposit rate, but independent of the absolute level of any of these interest rates.”   To see the role of the relative difference, consider the following thought experiment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For the sake of the argument, let me abstract from credit risk in the overnight market and assume that there is enough eligible collateral to borrow from the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Hence, there would be no material difference between very short-term secured and unsecured borrowing and lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.41,0)">Banks with excess reserves would only lend in the interbank market at a rate that is above the deposit rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.92,0)">Banks with a shortage of reserves would only borrow in the interbank market at a rate that is below the main refinancing rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Suppose now the main refinancing rate is equal to the deposit rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.65,0)">Then there is no rate at which trade is possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Hence, it is important to keep a spread between the main refinancing and the deposit rate in order to support market activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Another benefit of lowering the deposit rate together with the main refinancing rate is that in the current situation with excess liquidity, short-term interest rates such as EONIA track the deposit rate more closely than the main refinancing rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.87,0)">The banking system as a whole has excess liquidity, which currently stands at around € 130 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.19,0)">When the excess liquidity increases, rates fall since less must be borrowed in the interbank market  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.0,0)">In order to make sure that the monetary policy accommodation is passed on to the interbank market under fixed-rate full allotment and excess liquidity, it is therefore not enough to lower just the main refinancing rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.85,0)">In fact, the deposit rate may be the most important policy rate of a central bank in an environment of excess liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The decision to lower rates, which was accompanied by a number of other measures to stimulate credit to the economy such as “targeted” long-term operations   and an announcement of purchases of asset-backed securities and covered bonds based on claims on the euro area real economy, is also fully in line with the ECB’s forward guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Forward guidance implies that interest rates remain at present or lower levels for an extended period of time conditional on an assessment of the economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Following the June decision, the lower policy rates were transmitted well to the money market and, in line with forward guidance, market uncertainty about the expected path of policy rates fell.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.58,0)">EONIA forwards curves flattened and shifted down  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.25,0)">In addition, the volatility of EONIA rates as well as the option-implied volatility of short-term interest rates dropped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The lower policy rates were also transmitted to longer maturities and to market segments other than the unsecured money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.05,0)">EURIBOR rates and rates implied by EURIBOR futures fell after the June decision and again after the September decision  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.51,0)">Unsecured money market interest rates are now negative for a maturity of up two weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Besides, the General Collateral   pooling repo curve as well as yields on euro area Treasury bills and notes have further adjusted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.35,0)">The EONIA has regularly been set in negative territory since 28 August together with stable trading volumes     and homogenous transmission to closely substitutable market segments, such as GC pooling repo, are evidence that a large fraction of unsecured money market transactions can take place at negative rates without hampering market functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">This reflects an effective and well-coordinated preparation of market participants since the ECB first mentioned the possibility of bringing the DFR below zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.06,0)">The fact that money market trading volumes did not fall   is remarkable given the fears some observers had expressed, informed by the Japanese experience of the 1990s, on the potential impact on market functioning of a negative DFR and of very low policy rates more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Will the transmission of lower short-term rates to a lower cost of credit for the real economy be as smooth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.56,0)">While bank lending rates have come down in the past in line with lower policy rates, there is a limit to how cheap bank lending can be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.98,0)">The mark-up that banks add to the cost of obtaining funding from the central bank compensates for credit risk, term premia and the cost of originating, screening and monitoring loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The need for such compensation does not necessarily fall when policy rates are lowered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.73,0)">If anything, a central bank lowers rates when the economy needs stimulus, which is precisely when it is difficult for banks to find good loan making opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">It remains to be seen whether and to what extent the recent monetary policy accommodation translates into cheaper bank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.62,0)">Another concern with lowering rates is that it may contribute to the instability of the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.59,0)">While this can be a valid concern, in practice, a causal chain is difficult to establish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.77,0)">Do low rates really lead to instability   or are rates low because there has been instability in the financial system and the economy is in need of stimulus?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">That said, reducing excessive risk aversion in financial markets has been a welcome   effect of central bank policies during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.05,0)">The question is whether risk-taking in the financial sector has now already gone too far, contributing to growing financial imbalances, frothy asset price valuations and too loose credit standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.19,0)">Irrespective of the answer to this question, given the low inflation environment, it is clear that monetary policy cannot currently assume the role of addressing such concerns for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.84,0)">It is therefore the task of macro-prudential policies to deal with potential financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The supervisory set-up in Europe has undergone significant improvements that will help to ensure the soundness of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">As we enter an extended period of low interest rates, we must stand ready to use to their full extent the new macro-prudential instruments that the national competent authorities and the ECB are now entrusted with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">An important aspect of lowering policy rates was that it also reaffirmed our forward guidance and helped to clarify the ECB’s commitment to ensure that the monetary policy stance remains appropriate to the needs of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.24,0)">This is reflected in the EONIA-OIS curve being now flat and in negative territory for a maturity of up to three years, reflecting market expectations of negative EONIA fixings well into 2017  , and in a widening gap between the expected path of US and euro area interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.32,0)">A negative deposit rate can, however, also have adverse consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.25,0)">For a start, it imposes a cost on banks with excess reserves and could therefore reduce their profitability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.95,0)">For sure, lower bank profitability could hamper economic recovery, especially in times when banks have to deleverage owning to stricter regulation and enhanced market scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.92,0)">But whether bank profitability really falls when policy rates are lowered depends more generally on the slope of the yield curve  , on banks' investment policies   and on factors driving non-interest income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">More fundamentally, banks are profitable in a healthy economy where households and companies strive to finance their projects, which is what our accommodative monetary policy aims to achieve in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">In fact, both ensuring a smooth transmission of our low policy rates to the cost of credit to the economy and supporting the profitability of banks will ultimately depend on whether economic policies at the euro area and at the country level are successful in putting euro area economies back on a path of strong and stable growth, by mobilising both supply-side and, where available, demand-side instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">A prudent, well-capitalised banking system is needed in any case, and the ECB’s Comprehensive Assessment together with the start of the Single Supervisory Mechanism are key in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.21,0)">In order to avoid the cost of excess reserves, banks may also, decide to borrow less from the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.14,0)">This would reduce excess liquidity in the banking system and put upward pressure on interest rates in the interbank and bond market, which could counteract the reduction of policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.63,0)">But this is not what we have seen so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.06,0)">Despite the discussion on the adverse consequences of a negative deposit rate, there was no significant impact on the functioning of money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">I already mentioned the smooth transmission of rates and the stable trading volume in EONIA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.93,0)">Similarly, the level of excess liquidity or the amount of deposits with the ECB   has been largely unaffected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.81,0)">However, one possible reason for the stable level of the money market function could be the declining, but still existing fragmentation of the money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.67,0)">While a lot has been achieved, for example TARGET2 imbalances have fallen by nearly half since their peak in mid-2012  , market fragmentation in the euro area is still present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.77,0)">If banks with excess reserves are predominately highly profitable banks located in non-stressed countries, then a potential adverse effect on bank profitability may be less of a concern from the financial stability perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.65,0)">Similarly, if banks have good reason to borrow from the ECB, for instance when other sources of funding are not available, and if those banks that borrow are not necessarily the same as those that deposit with the ECB, then excess liquidity in the banking system may not fall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.43,0)">What about the impact of negative rates on market fragmentation in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.62,0)">Evidence from actual money market transactions shows that fragmentation still significantly hampers the smooth transmission of lower rates across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.08,0)">Banks located in non-stressed countries can now borrow in the overnight unsecured market at negative rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Rates for borrowers located in stressed countries are mostly positive and the distribution of rates is wide, ranging from slightly negative to slightly above the main refinancing rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">That said, there is some evidence that lower rates have reduced fragmentation in secured markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The search for yield in the low rate environment has increased the demand for higher yielding, but still safe products such as repo or sovereign bonds, including those of non-core countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.31,0)">The higher demand has pushed down and thus compressed interest rates in secured markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.63,0)">Given the theoretical arguments for and against lowering some policy rates into negative territory, and given the practical experience so far, what is the verdict?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Or, coming back to the opinions on Gesell: should he be considered a prophet or monetary crank?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">While the final verdict is certainly still out, based on the presented evidence so far, it seems fair to say that the lowering of policy rates, with the deposit rate moving into negative territory, has provided an appropriate monetary policy stimulus to the euro area economy, comforted the forward guidance of the ECB, and contributed to some reduction in market fragmentation, without having an adverse impact on the functioning of money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">As the money market settles in negative territory, and other market segments start experiencing negative yields, we now have to make sure that the broader market community is prepared to cope with this new environment.</span>
