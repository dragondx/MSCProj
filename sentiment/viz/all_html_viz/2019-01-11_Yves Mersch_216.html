    <span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)"> Tenth anniversary of the euro in Slovakia Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the International Conference to mark the tenth anniversary of the introduction of the euro in Slovakia, Bratislava, 11 January 2019 Charts I am honoured to be in Bratislava today and to speak before such a distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This conference marks the tenth anniversary of the euro in Slovakia, which in fact is a double anniversary as it coincides with twenty years of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">What could be a better anniversary gift, or a clearer symbol of the vitality of our single currency, than Slovakia’s success since the introduction of the euro on 1 January 2009?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Slovakia has achieved an impressive real convergence of living standards towards the EU average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The key ingredients of this success have been the country’s willingness to grasp the opportunities offered by EU membership and the adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Indeed, on the economic side fundamental institutional reforms allowed Slovakia to transition to a vibrant market economy and adopt a highly successful export-led growth model, which underpinned real convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Reforms rather than continued devaluation or requests for financial assistance is the recipe for success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.51,0)">Nevertheless, this should be no reason for complacency, as the next stage of convergence is bound to be harder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Neither EU membership nor the single currency offer an “autopilot” for strong economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">I will therefore argue that relentless efforts in the pursuit of institutional quality and good governance are essential in order to raise the country’s long-term growth capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The drivers of Slovakia’s success Within just three decades, Slovakia has made a remarkable economic transition from a centrally planned economy to a market economy that is closely integrated into the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The significant efforts made during the transition have clearly paid off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.0,0)">Having all but doubled since the early 1990s, Slovakia’s real GDP per capita stands at just over 80% of the EU average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Equally impressive has been the pace of economic convergence, which exceeded expectations based on the initial level of Slovak national income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Slovakia has managed to achieve a per capita GDP level above that of most other countries in central and eastern Europe  , and close to catching up with that of Slovenia and the Czech Republic  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Much of this success is rooted in the country’s remarkable institutional transformation in the context of joining the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Slovakia’s accession to the EU gave momentum to its convergence efforts and provided it with an external institutional anchor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Fundamental reforms such as the establishment of a clearly defined system of property rights, effective economic law enforcement and institutions to curb fraud and anticompetitive behaviour were crucial in allowing Slovakia to operate in a market economy and to cope with competition and market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Access to the Single Market and adoption of the acquis communautaire have contributed to Slovakia’s success in two ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">First, the removal of trade barriers and application of European-wide standards considerably reduced the cost of doing business across borders, fostering trade and encouraging the country’s participation in European value chains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Second, a more stable and predictable legal and regulatory environment improved investor security and contributed to a rapid inflow of foreign investment, providing the economy with the necessary foreign capital, know-how and technology to increase its competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The Slovak economy became deeply integrated into the Single Market, with an export share of almost 100% of GDP, well above that of other CEE economies  , and almost 20% of jobs depending on EU exports to the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The resulting significant economic convergence eventually paved the way for the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.13,0)">Many saw the loss of an independent monetary policy and the inability to respond to external shocks as the most significant cost of joining the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.66,0)">However, Slovakia’s high degree of openness had made it difficult for its national central bank to manage the business cycle in the face of volatile capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.54,0)">The exchange rate had more often become a source of shocks rather than a shock absorber.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">So the benefits of adopting the euro were compelling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">One immediate benefit was the stabilisation of Slovakia’s exchange rate with key trading partners and the elimination of currency conversion costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Research shows that euro adoption thereby contributed to a 12% increase in Slovakia’s exports to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">A further advantage of the introduction of the euro was the strengthening of Slovakia’s macroeconomic institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Adopting the euro gave further impetus to institutional convergence and allowed Slovakia to anchor its macroeconomic institutions in a stronger European framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">In the run-up to euro adoption, numerous amendments to the Slovak institutional framework were made to ensure convergence with EU requirements, which were closely monitored by the European institutions as in the ECB Convergence Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">High standards were required for the independence of the central bank, particularly for the personal independence of executive board members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Safeguarding institutional independence is crucial when European monetary policy coexists with national financial and labour market policies and where interests may not always be aligned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The embedding of Slovak institutions in a stable European institutional framework therefore contributed to macroeconomic stability during the crisis and increased investment and trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Indeed, in comparison with the Czech Republic, which has very similar economic structures, Slovakia has experienced faster economic growth since 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Although the Czech Republic was able to pursue an independent monetary policy during the crisis, Slovakia managed to maintain a 0.9 percentage point advantage over that country in terms of average annual GDP growth between 2009 and 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">As a result, the gap between Slovak and Czech GDP per capita narrowed from 21% in 2008 to 13.8% in 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The importance of institutional quality for long-term convergence May Slovakia’s success continue for many years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In the long run, though, it cannot be taken for granted that Slovakia’s growth model will continue to deliver strong growth; convergence with EU countries could slow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.45,0)">Slovakia risks falling into the so-called middle-income trap, whereby middle-income economies tend to follow a lower growth trajectory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Much of the country’s growth depends on its ability to attract foreign investment, skills and technology to raise productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.22,0)">However, the country has now started to experience a slowdown in foreign investment, technology diffusion and labour productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">For Slovakia to avoid the middle-income trap, it could be useful to develop new strategies focused on domestic innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Above all, this would lead to more productive firms, more private capital and more skilled labour to spur long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Such improvements, however, often depend on setting the right institutional conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Indeed, institutional quality has proved to be an important factor in achieving higher incomes in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.62,0)">Factors such as inefficient public administration, weak control of rent seeking, tax evasion and corruption hamper competition and economic inclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.67,0)">Slovakia ranks below the euro area average in some of these areas, as measured by the most commonly used institutional governance indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">More importantly, while most other new euro area countries showed some improvement over the past decade, reform momentum in Slovakia appears to have slowed after the euro was adopted  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">By improving in two key areas, Slovakia could help foster the right domestic conditions for businesses to thrive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">One area is improving the business environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.14,0)">According to the World Bank’s Doing Business Indicator, Slovakia ranks below the new euro area countries, in particular in areas such as starting a business, protecting minority investors or dealing with construction permits  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.27,0)">Moreover, 55% of entrepreneurs perceived corruption as a problem for doing business in the country, according to the Eurobarometer in 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Another area for potential improvement is the judicial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.14,0)">According to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development  , the integrity of the legal system and independence of the judiciary are perceived as insufficient  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">, Improving the independence and transparency of the judicial system could help in the fight against corruption and increase public confidence in the state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Addressing these issues would also create the conditions for national businesses to fully exploit the potential of the Single Market and contribute to sound and inclusive growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Conclusion As we celebrate ten years of euro adoption, Slovakia has become a success story for the convergence process in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The country can be proud of having achieved impressive economic and institutional convergence in such a short time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Slovakia’s success shows that EU accession and the adoption of the euro can create considerable opportunities – opportunities that can be seized, or wasted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Slovakia is a positive example of a country that has seized the opportunities of European integration through fundamental institutional reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Nevertheless, continued efforts in the pursuit of institutional quality and good governance are needed in all euro area countries in order to reap lasting benefits from Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This includes strict compliance with the doctrine of central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">For Slovakia, further improving the business environment and judicial system would help promote continued economic success over the next ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">I’m confident that sound domestic and European institutions will support sustainable growth and contribute to maintaining confidence in the euro and the European project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Real GDP per capita in terms of purchasing power parity as a percentage of the EU28 average in 2016.      ,
