    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.91,0)"> What is the outlook for the Single European Payments Area  ?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBComments prepared for Eurofi Conference on “Europe’s Retail Financial Services”Brussels, 6-7 June 2006 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to open this morning's panel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Let me start by saying how impressed and encouraged I am by what Eurofi has achieved over the past years in the field of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Eurofi analyses and communicates critical issues, crystallises the debate and helps to get a better understanding of the subject and the challenges ahead of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, “the proof of the pudding is in the eating”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This famous proverb is a healthy reminder of what is the essence for SEPA at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">We have a strong commitment from the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We have a clearly defined set of SEPA instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We have a timetable with precise deadlines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">What we need now is: to end the discussions about purpose and direction; to concentrate on implementation and communication, and to get all stakeholders – in addition to the banks - on board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In short: the ingredients are there and the cooks are appointed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let’s now make the pudding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The success of SEPA will depend on customers’ ability to use the SEPA instruments from 2008 onwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the following, I will briefly elaborate on these points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">National migration In order to successfully conduct the SEPA migration, an organisational structure representing all stakeholders needs to be set up in each country of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">I am pleased to report that such structures have been put in place already in a number of countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">For example, the Bank of Finland and the Finnish Banking Association published the SEPA implementation and migration plan for Finland in March 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Similarly, in Belgium a comprehensive migration plan has been developed and made available on the National Bank of Belgium’s internet website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Moreover, a SEPA committee has been set up in France and met in early April 2006 under the lead of Banque de France and the French Banking Association and comprises stakeholders and public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In other countries, similar steps are taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Furthermore, the EPC plans to set up programme management offices in each Euro area country in autumn  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These programme management offices will be responsible for the implementation and migration of the SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The ECB and NCBs are ready to give support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">We will present in September a comprehensive timetable for the coming implementation steps of the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Communication During the conceptual phase, the SEPA project has been known only within a relatively small circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.77,0)">Most customers, public administrations, merchants and small and medium sized enterprises, and even many large enterprises are still unaware of the SEPA process and its benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Thus, we need now a clear communication strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This communication strategy should include targeted messages and real-life examples for the regular customer of a high street bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.51,0)">SEPA will fail if it remains an abstract vision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">I know that the EPC has recently made a first step in this direction  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Further steps are needed and today's event is one effort in this direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Analysis of legal basis The European Central Bank welcomes the proposed directive on payment services in the internal market as it establishes a comprehensive legal framework for payment services in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">It will doubtlessly assist the banking industry in the realisation of the SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Thus, I am happy to see the EP and the Commission are very confident that the directive will soon be adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Nevertheless, the availability of the SEPA instruments is in my view not wholly contingent upon the adoption and transposition of the directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.52,0)">Thus, I would like to challenge any attempt to misuse the discussion on the payment services directive as an argument for delaying the work required to meet the 2008 SEPA deadline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.78,0)">Vision for 2010 The 2010 deadline for the SEPA has been repeatedly put into question, often with the arguments that there will be a lack of demand for the SEPA instruments and that the economic benefits projected will not materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In our view, standardisation and dematerialisation of payments are two measures that have the potential to realise considerable cost-savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Let me give you an example: Demand for cash is growing every year  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.71,0)">The use of cash compared to other means of payments is costly and these costs are borne by society not by those who avoid the use of transfers, debits or cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Banks and retailers could save hundreds of million of euro if they could convince costumers to use cards instead of cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.93,0)">Central banks issue reliable banknotes but they do not determine their use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.73,0)">They control quality – this is all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Therefore, it is up to banks and merchants to animate customers to change habits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">I would encourage banks and retailers to study the measures taken in countries which were successful in the move towards the use of cards - like Norway with its pricing of services according to the costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me also say a few words on the issue of cards and competition policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">In my view, it is important to remove barriers, to introduce competition and to allow the market to take up the business opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">In the telecom sector it worked well – although with some help by the regulators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.16,0)">Banks are not telephone companies but the current practices are not sustainable either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Standardization, choice of processing systems and single pricing for all SEPA domestic transactions are the steps that should be taken and there a clear signs that indeed the industry is taking these steps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.64,0)">Of course, the ECB is not an addressee for competition issues and I do not want to enter the debate on interchange fees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Let me only mention that as long as service providers respect the principle of no artificial limits to competition, cost recovery and normal business calculation will be accepted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In this respect, it is important that fees are fully transparent and that they are set according to an economic rationale and not as a result of market power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.2,0)">I understand that challenging established policies means economic uncertainty during the transition phase until a new framework is reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">However, the ongoing rapid expansion of the business should allow switching to new practices and contractual solutions in a smooth manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In this respect, it is important to stress the relevance of deadlines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">When the transition to a new framework is organised in a coordinated fashion with clear deadlines then the costs for the individual are lowest and network benefits can materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Furthermore, the revenue side could be enhanced by offering value-added services to customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">For instance, the banking sector could examine how to exploit the potential of e-invoicing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.08,0)">Leaving the work in this area entirely to the corporate sectors would mean to forego the chance to exploit a new business opportunity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.04,0)">As regards the demand side, it has often been argued that the cross-border share of customer payments is small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Yes, this is true, but adopting one standard for domestic and cross-border business allows banks to reorganise payment services, to pool business across border, to complement the growing cross-border exchanges of goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Let me conclude: The project is on track and many hands are needed for making the SEPA vision reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Coming back to the proverb that opened my intervention: “The proof of the pudding is in the eating”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.53,0)">I was told that this proverb was popularised by Cervantes in his Don Quixote.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I would therefore like to close with a clear message using Cervantes’ imagery: let us not fight wind mills but concentrate on the real issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">SEPA will only be a success if we deliver the instruments and win over the customers.</span>
