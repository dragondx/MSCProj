    <span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)"> The single supervisory mechanism – a step towards a European banking union Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,University of the Deutsche Bundesbank,Hachenburg, 27 June 2013 Dear Mr Böhmler, Dear Professor Keller, Ladies and Gentlemen, Students, In June last year, the heads of state and government of the European Union   decided to launch a banking union in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">This project is perhaps the largest and most important since the founding of the European monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Due to the impact of the acute pressure that the financial markets were exerting on the euro area, a timetable was even adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">Both steps demonstrated how Europe’s political leaders stand together and take resolute, joint action in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Before I discuss the details of this project and provide an overview of the preparatory work being done by the European Central Bank  , let me give you my key messages for this evening right now: Even if the need for short-term stabilisation measures has since eased, we must not lose momentum regarding reforms for greater long-term stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The various elements of the banking union are symbiotically linked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.45,0)">To forget or dilute individual parts endangers the success of the whole project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Stability and stabilisation of the monetary union Let me start with the differences and similarities between stability and stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">If a leaking ship gets into troubled waters, its crew has overcome two challenges at the same time: first, to keep the ship on course and to ride out the storm, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">secure the cargo and close the hatches and portholes so that they are waterproof.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.81,0)">These are the stabilisation measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.39,0)">Second, the holes have to be filled and leaks repaired so that the ship is not threatened with sinking when waves have died down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">That is about the stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Although the stabilisation measures are sometimes more urgent, restoring long-term stability is no less important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let me apply this idea to a repeatedly discussed point of contention in the macro economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.66,0)">If aggregate demand falls, it makes sense for the state to intervene temporarily via debt-financed stimulus programmes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But it cannot do this permanently; it must over the long term consolidate its budget in order to ensure the sustainable stability of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In other words, John Maynard Keynes’s comment, “In the long run we are all dead” is true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.99,0)">But it must not be confused with Madame Pompadour’s remark: “Après moi le déluge”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.52,0)">*** Europe, and especially the euro area, has been facing a double challenge for nearly six years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.48,0)">The global financial crisis which broke out in September 2008 and which grew into the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area in 2010 called for ever more extensive stabilisation measures: economic stimulus programmes and aid loans from governments and the international community as well as aggressive cuts in interest rates and unconventional monetary policy measures by the central bank were repeatedly required order to keep the economy from crashing into deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">In parallel, extensive repairs were initiated on the institutional foundations and governance framework in order to secure the long-term stability of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Crisis management in the euro area was first institutionalised in the form of the European Financial Stability Facility   in Luxembourg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.34,0)">Previously, the ad hoc crisis measures had to be organised by individual countries and the International Monetary Fund  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.82,0)">Since October last year the European Stability Mechanism   has permanently replaced the temporary EFSF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In addition, the governance framework has been strengthened in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.11,0)">In future, excessive imbalances in public budgets and balances of payments of the Member States are to be more effectively avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The Stability and Growth Pact has been strengthened and procedures implemented to avoid macroeconomic imbalances; and it was agreed to transpose the debt and deficit limits of the Stability and Growth Pact to the national legislation of all Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.05,0)">These long-term, preventive measures gain far less attention than the acute crisis interventions – from both financial markets and the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.41,0)">A government official wading through a flooded area in rubber boots in order to get an on-the-spot impression is the focus of attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.33,0)">The mayor of a neighbouring town who raised and strengthened the dykes in his community years ago and thus avoided a flood is rarely mentioned in the news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Banking union combines stabilisation and stability The construction of a European banking union should be seen in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The banking union combines both stabilisation and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">It should break the negative feedback loop between banks and sovereign debtors and curb the increasing fragmentation of European financial markets, thus ensuring a sustainable supply of credit to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.2,0)">It would be a misjudgement to believe that a monetary union could function without a banking union over the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The single monetary policy is still accompanied by a regime of national banking regulation, supervision, resolution and deposit insurance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.55,0)">The crisis has painfully exposed this design flaw in the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.99,0)">Let us briefly recall how the crisis started: the banking sector was in difficulty because it had taken on excessive risks, invested in complex financial products and was too leveraged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.42,0)">Some banks could therefore no longer tap the capital and interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.86,0)">At the same time, the plight of the banks in some countries was exacerbated by precarious budgetary situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.36,0)">On the one hand, confidence in the ability of certain states to support their banks dwindled in the face of high budget deficits and debt levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">This made the risk of default by the banks of these countries greater.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.73,0)">On the other hand, the problems in the banking sector in some countries posed a heavy burden on the national budget.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.53,0)">Public funds had to be mobilised to recapitalise distressed institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">If it is possible to break these negative feedback loops between banks and sovereign borrowers, this will lead to a significant stabilisation of Europe’s banking landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">At the same time, Europe’s banking sector will become more stable in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.06,0)">Integrated European banking But it’s not just about this acute problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.73,0)">The crisis has also exacerbated an already smoldering, structural problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">While the money and bond market was immediately and fully integrated with the introduction of the euro, the interest rates on corporate loans never fully aligned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.42,0)">Thus, even before the crisis, a company had to pay a different interest rate for the same loan from a German bank than from a Portuguese bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.97,0)">In other words, there was no European banking market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">A similar picture emerges when one looks at the market for bank mergers in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.29,0)">Most mergers take place within a country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.77,0)">Cross-border mergers between banks in different countries of the euro area were and still are the exception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The necessary consolidation of the banking sector is thus taking place nationally, but not at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In an integrated financial market, however, national boundaries should play no role in merger or investment decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">But within a monetary union an integrated banking market is of crucial importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Let me mention just three reasons for this: First, it promotes access to new capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Second, an integrated banking market is a spur to competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Greater competition means that the existing capital is allocated more efficiently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Firms’ financing conditions improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.6,0)">The beneficiaries of these two points are, in particular, small and medium-sized companies with no access to the capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The investment climate becomes more favourable, contributing to economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">And third, an integrated banking area increases the effect of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is especially true in an economy such as the euro area, in which about 80% of the financing of the real economy is via the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Monetary policy thus becomes more predictable, more homogeneous in its effects and more effective overall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Overview of the single supervisory mechanism The goal of the proposed banking union is to break the negative feedback loops between banks and sovereign debtors, and to put a stop to the increasing fragmentation of European financial markets and, over the long term, to fully integrate them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The institutional framework of the banking union comprises two key elements: the unified supervisory mechanism under the auspices of the ECB, and a European restructuring and resolution mechanism to consolidate or to wind up banks that are no longer viable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I’ll consider both these points below.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me start with the single supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">All banks in the euro area and credit institutions in those Member States which enter into close cooperation arrangements are covered by European supervision, the single supervisory mechanism, SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">EU Member States which have not   adopted the euro can however opt to transfer supervision to the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This emphasises the EU dimension of the project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">One reason why the single supervisory mechanism was assigned to the ECB is because of its well-established European perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">One cannot assume that a central supervisory authority would permit the banks of some countries to hide risky assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The denationalisation of supervision can greatly help to strengthen the trust of investors and depositors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The ECB will directly call for and take over the supervision only of large, systemically important financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Nevertheless, some national supervisors must follow the ECB’s regulations, guidelines and instructions in respect of the smaller banks which are subject to “indirect” supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.07,0)">In addition, the ECB may at any time demand and take over the direct supervision of smaller banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">According to current plans, central supervision will become operational in the second half of next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Even if the starting gun hasn’t been fired, preparations are well under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The ECB is working closely with the national supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Strategic preparations are being guided by a high-level group, chaired by the President of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">At the technical level, a supervisory task force has been charged with the preparatory work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">All competent national authorities are represented in both groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">In addition, a project team has been set up, whose members are leaders in the fields of supervision and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The purpose of this team consisting of staff from the national authorities and the ECB is to promote communication and cooperation within the system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.6,0)">The technical work has been divided into five areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The focal points are: the creation of a “map” of the banking system of the euro area, discussion of legal issues, development of a single supervisory model, coordination of the comprehensive assessment of credit institutions and preparation of a future model for supervisory reporting for the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The preparatory work for the balance sheet analysis of the supervised banks is of particular importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The regulatory text envisages the SSM carrying out a comprehensive assessment of the banks it directly supervises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This is the litmus test for the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In this context, it is useful to proceed in three stages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">First, the systemically important banks are subject to a centrally coordinated risk analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Use can certainly be made of the previous work of national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In this way, the most relevant asset classes and portfolios in the trading and banking books can be identified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Then the bank’s assets at any given time are analysed and evaluated specifically from a risk perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.08,0)">This asset quality review is the responsibility of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">However, effective implementation will require the involvement of the national supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">To accomplish the regime change to a credible single supervision, the asset quality review must be thorough and uncompromising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Recourse to external experts here will increase credibility vis-à-vis market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Finally, the banks will be rigorously checked to see how robust they are in respect of possible future stress scenarios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">This stress test will be conducted in close cooperation with the European Banking Authority  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The single resolution mechanism – a necessary complement However, the common banking supervision is only one element of an effective banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For the SSM to work, it must be complemented by a single resolution mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.3,0)">This will be entrusted with winding up non-viable banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.12,0)">For the supervisor to make such a judgement objectively, that judgement must also be enforceable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This requires a separate authority which intervenes directly in the banks to divide up losses between shareholders and creditors and which has access to public funds in order to bridge funding gaps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Without this body it is almost inconceivable to wind up a bank in an orderly way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.19,0)">The supervisor, especially when the function is entrusted to the central bank, could face a predicament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.04,0)">On the one hand, there is the danger of contagion and panic in the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.44,0)">On the other hand, an attempt to keep ailing banks artificially alive with central bank liquidity could lead to a zombification of the banking landscape.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.47,0)">Regulations supplement institutions Institutions need rules and instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The single supervisory mechanism will ensure that EU-wide regulations are respected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It operates under the acronym CRD IV/CRR and will come into force on 1 January 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The legal framework under which troubled banks and securities firms or non-viable institutions are to be resolved in an orderly fashion will be defined in a European directive  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Legal certainty and confidence about the liability cascade is crucial in order not to unsettle investors and depositors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Last night, the EU finance ministers agreed on liability rules for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.07,0)">Deposits up to €100,000 are untouchable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.85,0)">The state or the ESM should therefore fill shortfalls in bank balance sheets only above a certain threshold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Member States can use their discretion here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.16,0)">The political compromise is neither strictly bound by rules nor completely discretionary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Thus, a central authority is to decide on concrete implementation to ensure that the remaining room for manoeuvre is used appropriately and is not subject to national interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.2,0)">The Member States still have to negotiate with the European Parliament on the Directive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This process should be completed as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">*** Ladies and Gentlemen, Financial market tensions have clearly eased since last summer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.02,0)">The euro break-up scenario is no longer an issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.83,0)">To return to my initial imagery: the storm has subsided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.61,0)">Associated with that, the acute need for ad hoc interventions has declined – even if the euro area economy is still only modestly recovering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Yet there is still a need to continue urgently with the structural repair work on the institutional framework of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">To ensure that the European ship remains stable over the long term and stays on course, there should be no delay to the repairs needed and no slackening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The calm waters should be used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The agreed timetables for building a European banking union bank must be respected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">And it should not be forgotten these elements of the banking union are interdependent and form part of a common regime.</span>
