    <span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)"> Summary of “The ECB and the euro - the first five years” by Professor Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank Mais lecture, delivered at the Cass Business School, London, 12 May 2004 The European Central Bank   has now been conducting monetary policy for over five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Historically, the situation is unique: one currency – and one central bank – but at the same time, 12 countries and governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.83,0)">It is not surprising that there was considerable scepticism as to whether a single monetary policy for so many countries with differing economic structures and independent government policies could be successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.88,0)">Observers considered a whole range of different scenarios, from regarding the euro as a panacea for all of Europe’s economic ills to anticipating the collapse of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Against the background of these concerns, and in the light of the experience gained over these first five years, it is time to take stock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The ECB has without doubt been successful in fulfilling its mandate to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">What have been the factors underlying this success?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The mandate to maintain price stability, as enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty has, of course, been of paramount importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The political independence of the ECB provides a solid institutional framework for the pursuit of that primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">A significant part of the success is certainly also attributable to the ECB’s monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">As a new institution, the ECB was not able to rely on a track record of past successes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">It was therefore particularly important to commit to a publicly announced monetary policy strategy which would provide a framework for internal analysis and decision-making in pursuit of the stated objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">A purely discretionary approach was not an option.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In particular, the strategy had to serve the purpose of establishing a solid anchor for inflation expectations and set a benchmark which the public could use to hold the ECB accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">At the same time, the strategy had to be robust and flexible enough to enable the ECB to meet the specific challenges faced by the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.09,0)">Such challenges were created by the high degree of uncertainty regarding the transmission mechanism and the possibility of structural breaks resulting from the launch of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.77,0)">Knowledge about the transmission of monetary policy impulses to inflation and economic activity was very limited, as was the availability of timely and harmonised macroeconomic data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.06,0)">The ECB was acutely aware of this situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">In 1998, it announced a strategy that took account of these concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The strategy was based on fundamental theoretical considerations and empirical knowledge, as well as on decades of policy experience acquired by the national central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In May 2003, in the light of the experience acquired in its first five years, the ECB conducted an evaluation of its monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">As a result, the main elements of the strategy were confirmed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The upper ceiling on the definition of price stability has remained at 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">At the same time, the Governing Council clarified that it would seek to achieve an inflation rate below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It also confirmed that its assessment of risks to price stability would continue to be based on two complementary perspectives: an economic and a monetary analysis – the two pillars of the strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The monetary analysis thereby serves as a means of cross-checking, from a medium to long-term perspective, the short to medium-term indications arising from the economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In view of the specific challenges posed by the nature of the new currency area, the ECB, when developing its strategy in 1998, decided on a new approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">It chose neither a monetary targeting nor inflation targeting strategy, and with good reason.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.5,0)">A focus on a simple indicator or a single analytical approach, be it a monetary aggregate or an inflation forecast, would not have done justice to the uncertainties faced by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The two pillars provide an appropriate framework for bringing together and cross-checking different analytical approaches and making systematic use of all information relevant to decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">The advantages of this approach are increasingly being recognised, not least from the perspective of the relationship between monetary and credit developments and asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The monetary policy strategy proved itself under the specific conditions prevailing in the euro area at the start of Monetary Union and has remained superior to the alternatives beyond that initial phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The ECB has gained a high level of credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Notwithstanding the substantial and prolonged price shocks witnessed between 1999 and 2001, long-term inflation expectations have been anchored at stable levels consistent with the definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.16,0)">However, despite the achievements in the area of price stability, macroeconomic conditions in the euro area remain unsatisfactory: High unemployment, weak economic growth and growing public deficits clearly indicate the need for urgent structural reforms.</span>
