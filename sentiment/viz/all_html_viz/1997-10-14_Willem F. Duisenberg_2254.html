    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)"> Monetary stability and economic growth or: Why stable prices are good for private enterprise in France and the Netherlands Speech delivered by Dr. W.F.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Duisenberg, President of the European Monetary Institute, to the French/Dutch Chamber of Commerce in The Hague, 14 October 1997 I shall today address a subject which is very familiar to central bankers: namely, the relationship between monetary stability, monetary policy and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">More particularly, I would like to focus my remarks on the benefits of stable prices for private enterprise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">MONETARY STABILITY IN EMU As you know, the core task of a central bank is to safeguard the purchasing power of money or, to put it differently, to create a zone of monetary stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The concept of monetary stability comprises in any case the requirement that money has a stable internal value or, to express this in more familiar terms, that there is price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Under specific circumstances, namely when foreign countries also adhere to price stability, this also creates favourable conditions for a stable external value of the currency, in other words, exchange rate stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me dwell for a moment on these two aspects of monetary stability, their interlinkages and their relative weight in formulating monetary policy in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">A growing number of central banks throughout the world have been given the legal mandate to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Such a mandate also applies in the case of the European System of Central Banks  , as the Maastricht Treaty explicitly states that "the primary objective of the ESCB shall be to maintain price stability".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Following a definition which has been advocated by my colleagues Paul   In contrast, some central banks of other, usually larger, EU countries have preferred to focus their monetary policy directly on the achievement of price stability and thereby also to lay the foundations for a stable exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">While this has allowed them to set official interest rates in line with domestic price requirements, these were nonetheless influenced by the interaction between exchange rate developments and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">As experience has shown, the success of either form of monetary policy orientation depends crucially on the support of economic policies directed at sound public finances, responsible wage behaviour and efficient markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">In Stage Three of EMU, the ESCB will carry out its mandate of ensuring price stability in a somewhat different economic environment, comparable to the situation of the Federal Reserve in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The euro area will be a large internal market with strong trade relations among its partners stimulated by the existence of a single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.34,0)">As a natural consequence, trade flows with the rest of the world will be rather small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This allows the ESCB to focus primarily on "domestic" inflationary risks and to consider fluctuations in the euro exchange rate only to the extent that these significantly affect "domestic" prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This also explains why it has now been agreed that any so-called orientations that might be formulated by the ECOFIN Council in the field of exchange rate policy for the euro area will be limited to exceptional circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">As stated in the Treaty, such general orientations shall be without prejudice to the primary objective of the ESCB to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.72,0)">Against this background, some people have asked me "Where does all this leave economic growth?"</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Behind this question seems to be the idea that the ESCB could - or even should - use monetary policy to promote growth and employment in EMU, especially in view of the high level of unemployment in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">In answer to this question, I refer to the Statutes of the ESCB which stipulate that "without prejudice to the objective of price stability, it shall support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to the achievement of the objectives of the Community", which include inter alia sustained non-inflationary growth and a high level of employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Also relevant in this context is the sentence that the ESCB "shall act in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition, favouring an efficient allocation of resources".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Before I go on to discuss the relationship between monetary policy and economic growth in more detail, it may be useful to recall the costs of inflation - or, to put it differently, the reasons why a climate of price stability provides substantial benefits, especially for private enterprise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">My remarks should make clear that I see no conflict between price stability and a balanced development of economic activity in EMU; on the contrary, a stable price environment provides excellent conditions for a flourishing market economy and thus supports a healthy creation of employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Indeed, the best way for monetary policy to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the Community is precisely by focusing on price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">BENEFITS OF PRICE STABILITY To arrive at a clearer understanding of the economic and social costs of inflation it is helpful to distinguish between anticipated and unanticipated inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let me start with the case of inflation which is fully expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.08,0)">Although the public will normally have taken account of expected price increases in their economic decision-making, this aspect of inflation nonetheless imposes non-negligible costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.98,0)">They relate in particular to attempts by the public to economise on non-interest-bearing money holdings, the need to constantly revise price lists, and the misallocation of resources due to the operation of tax systems which are not fully indexed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">At first sight these costs might appear somewhat trivial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.58,0)">The truth of the matter is, however, that the efficiency losses can be very large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This is perhaps most evident in the case of the tax argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.85,0)">Taken by itself, the imposition of personal and corporate income taxes distorts the allocation of productive resources in a market-based economy because it leads to a bias towards current consumption relative to savings and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.68,0)">Recent academic studies have found that the interaction between inflation and income taxes has the unintended effect of exacerbating these distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.98,0)">Calculations for the United States suggest that the negative impact of 2 percentage points extra inflation could be as high as 1% of GDP on a permanent basis, in other words output is 1% lower each year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Although this outcome is sensitive to the underlying assumptions, similar work undertaken for some EU countries   broadly confirms the conclusion that reducing inflation and thereby the magnitude of tax distortions brings substantial benefits which, over the longer term, exceed the transitional disinflation costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Given the adverse effects associated with inflation, it is thus worthwhile accepting the transitional sacrifices in output of moving to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The costs associated with unanticipated inflation are perhaps even more evident, as they arise above all from the uncertainty that goes with it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Clearly, an environment of stable prices offers a much more reliable basis for corporate decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In evaluating investment opportunities, it is crucial for firms to be able to rely on the signals conveyed by relative price changes, as these will tell them whether or not it is profitable to engage in a certain productive activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">For this mechanism to function properly, firms must be able to discriminate between relative price adjustments and general changes in the price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.66,0)">However, this is a particularly difficult exercise in periods of high and variable inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This also explains why the prospect of a single currency produces large benefits; it allows cross-border relative price comparisons to be made without the distorting influence of exchange rate fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The more reliable the information on relative prices, both nationally and across borders, the more an efficient allocation of scarce resources and the ability of a market economy to function properly is promoted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The same positive result for resource allocation arises from the fact that in a non-inflationary environment firms are more willing to enter into long-term investment contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.73,0)">After all, when considering a long time period for evaluating costs and revenues they face a smaller risk of unanticipated inflation wiping out expected real profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">At times of high and variable inflation, however, they tend to prefer projects which promise a quick return on investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">In addition, the expected real return must be higher, because - with a higher degree of uncertainty over inflation - firms are confronted with a higher real cost of borrowing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.57,0)">This can be explained by the fact that financing costs tend to include an insurance premium to cover the risk of unexpected changes in the price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">A climate of stable prices thus offers companies substantial benefits in terms of lower real interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This brings me to one of the main arguments against inflation, namely the unintended redistributive consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.45,0)">Inflation effectively functions as a tax which, at random and without justification, causes a redistribution of income and wealth, especially if it comes unanticipated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Who will profit and who will lose from it, depends on whether and to what extent people are able to predict and neutralise the effects of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.33,0)">The outcome of this process is uncertain, but all too often it is the weaker in society who cannot protect themselves and bear the brunt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.38,0)">Accepting high inflation is thus equivalent to allowing a social injustice to endure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.92,0)">Ultimately, this undermines the cohesion of society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.85,0)">Another point to note in this context is that at times when wage increases are the driving force behind inflation, the macroeconomic income distribution tends to change to the benefit of employees and to the detriment of profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">On the one hand, wage rises in excess of labour productivity growth fuel domestic inflation, to the extent that firms succeed in passing on the increase in unit labour costs in domestic sales prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.81,0)">On the other hand, firms facing international competition normally have to cut profit margins in response to higher unit labour costs, in order not to lose their share of the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In many European economies - including France and the Netherlands - this two-way mechanism was clearly visible in the simultaneous rise of inflation and labour's share of GDP in the 1970s and early 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">A reverse process was set in motion in the course of the 1980s: parallel to the decline in inflation the share of profits in GDP increased, which in turn offered opportunities for investment, output growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">MONETARY POLICY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH Having arrived at a clear view of the benefits of price stability, it is time to devote a few words to the question of what may be expected from the monetary policy of the ESCB in terms of support for growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Here, it would seem that some observers still live in the "era of great expectations" which characterised the 1970s, when expansionary policies were adopted in order to stimulate domestic demand, while neglecting their adverse consequences for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.27,0)">Society has paid a high price for this illusion in terms of stagnating economic growth combined with high and volatile inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The lesson which should be taken to heart is that expectations must be realistic and not overburden the monetary policy of the ESCB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me elaborate this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">First, the contribution that monetary policy can make towards balanced growth and employment is above all to provide for a stable price climate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.37,0)">However, it would be a tragic mistake to assume that the ESCB bears sole responsibility for establishing and maintaining price stability for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Monetary policy needs to be supported by sound budgetary policies and wage developments in line with productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In other words, the overall policy mix must be appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.23,0)">Without adequate support from other policy areas, the ESCB may be forced to take measures in the fight against inflation which entail a short-term loss in output and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.68,0)">This might have adverse consequences for the public's opinion of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">However, these short-term sacrifices are justified in order to safeguard the foundations for balanced growth and employment in the longer run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This also explains why it is so important that the Maastricht Treaty assigns a high degree of independence to the ESCB in carrying out its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">The credibility of its monetary policy is further supported by the budgetary provisions of the Treaty which oblige Member States to avoid excessive budget deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.62,0)">As clarified in the Stability and Growth Pact, excessive deficits are only allowed in clearly defined exceptional circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">In addition, the Stability and Growth Pact specifies a procedure for a rapid correction of excessive deficits in euro countries should they nevertheless arise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Second, one should realise that monetary policy in EMU applies to the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.36,0)">As a consequence, it cannot be used for solving regional problems or country-specific economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">These require above all well-functioning labour and product markets which allow wages and prices to adjust if local economic conditions have changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">In addition, national budgets must have sufficient room for manoeuvre to let automatic stabilisers work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">As a further element of the Stability and Growth Pact, all Member States have therefore committed themselves to the achievement of a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Under normal circumstances, this should allow budget deficits to fluctuate around zero, while at the same time respecting the 3% ceiling as specified in a protocol to the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.74,0)">Third, it is a well-known fact that the effects of monetary policy occur with long and variable lags.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.68,0)">For this reason, it is impossible to use it for fine-tuning purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Monetary policy can only pursue price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Once price stability is ensured, monetary policy may be used in such a way as to contribute to an automatic stabilisation of the business cycle, which means that this stabilisation does not require discretionary measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Fourth, sustainable growth and a healthy creation of employment require more than just an appropriate monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.06,0)">This can be aptly illustrated by the current unemployment problem in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">As its underlying causes are structural, its solution requires structural remedies and not an expansionary monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">As the experience of recent years shows, those Member States that have undertaken fundamental labour market reforms have achieved both a strong recovery of employment and stable prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">At the same time, they often successfully managed to reduce their budget deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Accordingly, if all policy areas contribute to creating the right conditions, price stability will over the longer term go hand in hand with a balanced economic development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">The task is thus to ensure that in Stage Three of EMU an appropriate overall policy mix is achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">For the monetary policy decisions of the ESCB to be well-informed and optimal with respect to its primary and secondary objectives, there is evidently a need for a regular dialogue and exchange of information on issues of common interest with third parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This applies in particular to national economic policies, wage developments and the overall fiscal policy stance in the Monetary Union; under exceptional circumstances this could also include the exchange rate policy for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The question is how to organise such a constructive dialogue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The current situation in the Member States is that the Governor of the national central bank has a natural counterpart in the Minister of Finance, with whom frequent contacts exist, often on a weekly basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In my previous capacity as Governor of the Nederlandsche Bank, I had, for example, regular lunch appointments with the Minister of Finance to discuss matters of common interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In Stage Three of EMU the situation is more complicated, but the Treaty does contain some provisions in this regard  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.22,0)">On the one hand, the President of the ECOFIN Council   may participate in the meetings of the Governing Council of the ECB and submit motions for deliberation, without the right to vote.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">On the other hand, the President of the ECB will be invited to take part in meetings of the ECOFIN Council when matters relating to the objectives and tasks of the ESCB are on the agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Finally, in addition to national delegations  , two representatives of the ECB will participate in the preparatory meetings of the Economic and Financial Council, the successor to the current Monetary Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">It would thus seem to me that the Treaty contains sufficient institutional provisions for the co-ordination between economic and monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">CONCLUSION Let me now come to a conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">First, I have argued that for the ESCB the concept of safeguarding monetary stability is to be interpreted as equivalent to the task of ensuring price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Given the large size of the euro area, the stability of the exchange rate of the euro area cannot be a direct policy focus but will have to be the outcome of the successful implementation of stability-oriented policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Second, I have made clear that price stability is one of the pre-conditions for a flourishing market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">Third, I have pointed out that for price stability in EMU to go hand in hand with sustainable growth and a healthy creation of employment, it is essential to have an appropriate overall policy mix.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Fortunately, the Treaty contains sufficient institutional provisions to achieve a well-balanced combination of economic and monetary policy in EMU.</span>
