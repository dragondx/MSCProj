    <span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)"> Fiscal and monetary policy in EMU Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo,Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank10.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Internationales Finanz- und WirtschaftsforumVienna, 11 November 2004 We European central bankers have a unique perspective from which to view the interaction of fiscal and monetary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Unlike most central bankers around the world today, and throughout history, our point of reference is no longer the traditional one-to-one fiscal-monetary policy relationship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.87,0)">At the European Central Bank  , we have to concern ourselves with the implications for our monetary policy of the 12 fiscal policies of the countries of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The economic policy framework of Economic and Monetary Union   combines a supranational monetary policy, conducted at the euro area level, with decentralised fiscal policies, which remain the responsibility of national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Such a Monetary Union was only made possible by the emergence of a consensus that macroeconomic stability, built on sound public finances and a stability-oriented monetary policy, is a prerequisite for sustainable economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The framework for fiscal and monetary policies in EMU is built around this consensus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Under this framework, sound public finances are to be guaranteed by the commitment of Member States to avoid excessive deficits and to correct them promptly should they nonetheless occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In this respect, the Stability and Growth Pact puts “flesh on the bones” of the fiscal rules and procedures of the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It strengthens and clarifies the procedures for mutual surveillance and peer pressure among Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">And by committing Member States to achieve close-to-balance or in-surplus budgetary positions over the medium term, it aims to ensure that the avoidance of excessive deficits does not come into conflict with the operation of automatic stabilisers in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Meanwhile, monetary policy is conducted by an independent central bank with a clear mandate to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Monetary policy is thus protected from short-term political considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is also protected from the direct effects of fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.88,0)">Monetary financing is prohibited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.77,0)">And the Eurosystem is explicitly forbidden to “bail out” Member States with financial difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.7,0)">In short, fiscal and monetary policies are kept at arm’s length from one another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Of course, fiscal and monetary policies matter for each other in EMU as anywhere else.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">For this reason, a regular dialogue between the fiscal and monetary authorities takes place, in particular in the Eurogroup.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.66,0)">But this does not imply any ex ante coordination or blurring of responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Rather, each institution and government is responsible for “keeping its own house in order”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">* * * What can be said after nearly six years of experience with this framework?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">First, the “Maastricht consensus” remains valid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">At least, I do not hear voices directly questioning the need for sound public finances and price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Second, monetary policy is doing its job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Markets and the general public seem confident that the Eurosystem will live up to its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.95,0)">Third, fiscal policies are proving more problematic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.93,0)">In a number of countries, fiscal positions have deteriorated in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.8,0)">Excessive deficits have emerged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.67,0)">And the procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact aimed at preventing and correcting these excessive deficits have not always been properly complied with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.03,0)">This lack of compliance calls into question the effectiveness of the EMU fiscal rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And it has led to an intense debate, in academia, among the informed public and among policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">I should like to concentrate the remainder of my remarks on this debate; to ask, and hopefully provide some answers to, questions related to this debate: Why do we need fiscal rules in EMU?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.33,0)">Are there costs associated with these rules?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Are our rules sensible?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">And, finally, what can be done to improve their implementation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.84,0)">* * * Let me start with why we need fiscal rules at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In this respect, I think it is useful to distinguish between the single country case and the specific context of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In a purely national setting, fiscal rules are very desirable as part of an institutional design geared towards achieving sound public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.49,0)">It is by now widely accepted that governments driven by the short-term interest of re-election are prone to increasing deficits and debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Fiscal rules at the national level can help to correct this “deficit bias”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">By committing governments to achieve a certain fiscal outcome, fiscal rules can also create appropriate benchmarks for markets and the public to judge fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.59,0)">Fiscal rules should prevent unsustainable debt developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">To the extent that they succeed in fostering sustainability, they should help to mitigate uncertainty as to government actions and thereby facilitate the long-term planning of economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">They can also contribute to improving the quality of public finances by influencing the size and composition of government spending and taxation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For these reasons, fiscal rules at the national level are in the interest of the country concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.43,0)">The absence of such rules would possibly lead to higher deficits and debt, but whether or not to adopt such rules is essentially a domestic issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In EMU the situation is intrinsically different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.35,0)">Because the countries of the euro area share a common currency, the externalities arising from their fiscal policies are of a completely different order of magnitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.39,0)">And these externalities are liable to give rise to adverse incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In a monetary union, it remains primarily the country relaxing its budgetary policy that enjoys the short-term political benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.33,0)">But, in so doing, it taps the common pool of savings, putting upward pressure on interest rates in the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Part of the cost of borrowing is thereby passed on to other member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.61,0)">In the absence of exchange rate risks within the monetary union, the sanctioning role of financial markets also declines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This can clearly be seen in euro area government bond yields, which point to a narrowing of spreads across countries and the emergence of a highly integrated bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.15,0)">And if excessive borrowing in one country or group of countries leads to inflationary pressures or even, in the extreme, to a risk of default, the implications in terms of monetary policy and financial stability will be felt by all the members of the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In a monetary union, fiscal rules are essential not only to contain domestic deficit biases but also to protect against cross-country externalities and adverse incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Indeed, without such rules, the countries of the euro area would never have agreed to share a common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.53,0)">* * * Even if fiscal rules are necessary in a monetary union, do they nonetheless imply costs?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.85,0)">Some would argue that fiscal rules limit the stabilisation function of fiscal policy; and that in EMU active fiscal policies are all the more necessary given the loss of monetary policy as an instrument with which to deal with country-specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">This argument assumes that activist fiscal policy is effective in helping to stabilise the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.22,0)">But both theoretical and empirical research raise doubts about the success of active fiscal stabilisation policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.71,0)">Indeed, the past experience of most countries shows that the use of discretionary fiscal policy for short-term demand management is extremely difficult to implement successfully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.93,0)">Given the time-lags involved in recognising the cyclical situation and then passing the necessary legislation, the impact of the measures taken often comes too late.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.09,0)">In some cases, discretionary measures intended to be counter-cyclical even turn out to be pro-cyclical by the time their impact is felt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.44,0)">And expansionary fiscal measures have proven difficult to reverse, exacerbating the deficit bias of governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.29,0)">The limitations of an active fiscal policy may be even greater when there is uncertainty about future income developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.29,0)">This is the case today in many European countries where there is growing concern about the difficulties faced by public pension and health care systems in view of demographic trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.06,0)">Under such circumstances, tax cuts and expenditure increases today simply translate into higher taxes or lower expenditure tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Aware of this, the public increasingly reacts to fiscal expansions by raising precautionary savings rather than consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In contrast to active fiscal stabilisation, the public budget is, generally, an effective tool for smoothing cyclical fluctuations automatically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It does this through the operation of its built-in stabilisers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.74,0)">Most tax revenues and certain social benefits respond counter-cyclically to output fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.17,0)">And they do so with more or less immediate effect and without any discretionary action on the part of government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">However, fiscal policy can only act as an effective stabilising tool when there is the necessary room for manoeuvre.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The experience of industrialised countries in recent decades clearly shows that persistent fiscal imbalances limit the room for fiscal policy to stabilise the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.11,0)">Imbalances often necessitate tight fiscal policies during downturns to prevent unsustainable deficits and debt developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Well-designed fiscal rules should address this problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">In the case of the Stability and Growth Pact, the close-to-balance-or-in-surplus requirement is intended to create room for automatic stabilisation while respecting the 3% limit on budget deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">And respecting this requirement should ensure appropriate debt developments so that sustainability is not put at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In this way the rules should support rather than limit the stabilisation function of fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">* * * Fiscal rules are necessary in a monetary union to ensure long-run sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And, if appropriately designed, they should not imply costs in terms of short-run stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But are our rules well-designed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Do the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact make economic sense?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.5,0)">This is a hotly debated question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is also a complex question; and answering it requires an appropriate perspective and a certain amount of realism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.99,0)">It has to be borne in mind that the Stability and Growth Pact is not a rule for a single country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">It is a framework for ensuring fiscal discipline among the 25 Member States of the European Union, and is particularly important for the 12 countries of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.94,0)">Designing a set of rules in a multinational context is always going to be more challenging than designing rules for the single country case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.86,0)">On the one hand, what makes sense for one country will not always make sense for others; but on the other hand, you can’t have different rules for everybody.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Fairness demands equal treatment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.17,0)">In the real world, a number of trade-offs have to be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The rules need to be based on an appropriate economic rationale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">But they also need to be simple and transparent enough to allow for appropriate monitoring and scrutiny, including by markets and by the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.97,0)">Elaborate rules may be intellectually appealing to economists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.88,0)">But what use are they if the measures on which they are based cannot be computed within any reasonable degree of certainty?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.53,0)">What use are rules if they are so complex that it is almost impossible to determine whether they are being respected or not?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The rules need to be simple enough to be understood and strict enough to ensure fiscal discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">But there also needs to be enough flexibility to take into account unusual or unforeseen events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A balance therefore has to be struck between a more mechanistic application of the rules and the exercise of judgement; between rules and discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">All of these issues were debated when the Stability and Growth Pact was first proposed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">And the outcome of this debate was already a sensible compromise: a reflection of the need to combine economic soundness with simplicity and transparency, to balance rules and discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.01,0)">This does not mean that alternative rules would not have been possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">But by and large the current rules are appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">They strike the right balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.06,0)">I fear that those who would like new, supposedly better, rules risk embarking on a quest for a holy grail that doesn’t exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.79,0)">And they would do so unnecessarily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.05,0)">Nowhere has it been established that the existing rules are the source of current fiscal problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.33,0)">Rather, it is the lack of implementation of the rules that is the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is where we need to focus our attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">* * * But how can the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact be improved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">A first, admittedly rather simplistic, answer to this question is for governments and institutions to start living up to their commitments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">If all Member States had vigorously pursued the Pact’s close-to-balance-or-in-surplus objective during the last upturn, then the current fiscal problems would be much less severe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We must learn from such mistakes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Beyond this, a number of proposals put on the table by the European Commission represent a step in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Strengthening the focus on debt and sustainability when scrutinising national budgets would enhance the economic rationale and hence, potentially, support for the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Adjusting the timetable for multilateral surveillance – so that the examination of countries’ stability programmes precedes the preparation of national budgets – could help to ensure that peer pressure at the European level translates into policy action at home.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.46,0)">A more timely use of the “early warning mechanism” could also create additional pressure to comply with the rules in good times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Improving the information base for fiscal surveillance is also of crucial importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.09,0)">If fiscal surveillance is based on wrong or outdated figures, not only will it be ineffective, but judgements made and decisions taken are likely to be wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It is therefore of vital importance for the credibility of fiscal surveillance that the reliable and timely reporting of government finance statistics is ensured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The European accounting rules must be fully respected when recording all types of expenditure and revenue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">This should be done in a manner that is consistent and stable over time and homogeneous across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.67,0)">As stated by the ECOFIN Council, budgetary statistics must not be vulnerable to political and electoral cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Countries must consider the quality and integrity of their statistics as a priority matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">If introduced and applied sensibly, many of these changes to the way the Stability and Growth Pact is implemented that have been proposed by the Commission could give rise to improvements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.88,0)">But one should also not raise false expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.62,0)">At the heart of the current problems is an issue of lack of compliance and lack of incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.24,0)">There is no magic formula for solving these problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.73,0)">What can be said, however, is that the current problems will certainly not be addressed by changing the Regulations of the Pact and by further complicating the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.7,0)">In this respect, proposals to make the Excessive Deficit Procedure more flexible are a cause for serious concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.88,0)">If implemented, these changes would weaken rather than strengthen incentives for fiscal discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.35,0)">And they would erode the credibility of the 3% nominal anchor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">* * * Let me end my remarks by recalling that, in the field of monetary policy, the answer to the problem of the “inflation bias” that plagued many countries for several decades was one of governance, namely, granting independence to central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">With an independent central bank, the euro area already has a highly predictable monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">There is no ambiguity as to how monetary policy will respond to economic – including fiscal – developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">It will respond to the extent that they pose risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Unfortunately, the problem of the deficit bias of fiscal policy does not lend itself to such a simple solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Nonetheless, I perceive a need to reflect further on governance issues and the strengthening of incentives for compliance, both at the European and at the national level, if the implementation of the Pact is to be fundamentally improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Governance structures must provide the right incentives for the governments and the institutions concerned to interact in a way that ensures fiscal discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Responsibilities – and hence accountability – must be clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And above all, there must be the political will to comply with the rules and to apply the procedures in a strict and timely manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Only then is there a chance that fiscal policy in the euro area will work without conflict towards a higher level of welfare and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And only then will a European central banker who is asked to talk about fiscal and monetary policy be inclined to focus a little less on the former and a little more on the latter.</span>
