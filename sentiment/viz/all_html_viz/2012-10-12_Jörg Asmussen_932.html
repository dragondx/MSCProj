    <span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)"> The Eurozone and Japan: The Way Forward Intervention on the panel by Jörg Asmussen, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the 2012 Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank Group, Tokyo, 12 October 2012 Ladies and gentleman, It is a pleasure to take part in this discussion today, and in particular to join the company of such a distinguished panel of European and Japanese colleagues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">With events moving so fast in the euro area – and in ways that are often confusing for outsiders – getting out and speaking to investors around the world is more necessary than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">So let me also extend my thanks to Juergen Fitschen and Deutsche Bank for organising this very useful event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As time is short, I would like to begin my intervention by jumping straight into the three questions that are the focus of this panel today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">How to return to sustainable debt levels in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.4,0)">How to deal with intra-euro area competitiveness imbalances?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.59,0)">Where does the euro area go from here?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">How to return to sustainable debt levels in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Turning to the first question: how to return to sustainable debt levels in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.14,0)">Debt sustainability in the euro area is being questioned for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.29,0)">The first reason is that some investors are afraid of destructive scenarios that could lead to default or, in the extreme, exit from the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.06,0)">As a result, they are forcing some countries to pay risk premia that are not fully justified by underlying fundamentals, making those destructive scenarios self-fulfilling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But this aspect of debt sustainability can be addressed by simply changing perceptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Here, the ECB’s recent announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions should play a supportive role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">It provides a credible backstop for tail risks and confirms that the euro is irreversible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.07,0)">The second reason debt sustainability is being questioned is that certain euro area countries have debt levels that are too high, or on a sharply rising trajectory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.63,0)">This is more complex to deal with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.52,0)">Inflating away the debt burden is not an option in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.28,0)">So Member States have to take policy actions to redress public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">But the evidence suggests it can be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">To stabilise debt levels, the euro area already has a benchmark a new debt reduction rule agreed as part of reforms to fiscal governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.06,0)">Observing it will be difficult for some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.76,0)">But they have made similar adjustments in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,110.34,0)">Many ran fiscal surpluses for years before entry into the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">To support this process, it is urgent to improve euro area growth rates, which are projected to remain low for a number of years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">This can be done by unlocking the many rigidities that still exist in euro area product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This process of debt stabilisation is already well underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The IMF projects that the euro area will be almost in primary balance this year, with an average debt level just over 90% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In terms of fiscal consolidation, this puts the euro area significantly ahead of some other advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.4,0)">How to deal with intra-euro area competitiveness imbalances?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Ensuring debt sustainability is to a large degree linked to the second question of today’s panel: how to deal with intra-euro area competitiveness imbalances?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To some extent, this question is already answered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Rebalancing is happening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Large competitiveness adjustments are taking place in the so-called periphery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The countries under full EU-IMF programmes have seen unit labour costs improve by around 10% since 2008, relative to the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.77,0)">Current account deficits are on average 8 percentage points of GDP lower than they were then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">But to ensure that this competitiveness improvement is structural rather than cyclical, three further elements are crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">First, continued and determined reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And this ultimately has to go beyond economic policies and into fundamental issues of governance, like public administration, judiciary and education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Second, the completion of Europe’s Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.82,0)">It does not serve citizens to protect local monopolies that lead to high prices and low quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Europe has some of the world’s most sophisticated and innovative companies, and they should be operating on a European scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Third, stronger economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">We have already made some progress here with a new procedure to monitor and correct euro-area imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">But we also need to find better ways to incentivise continued structural reform, including through the use of common funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">All these measures are of course relevant for the country most in the media spotlight, Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">A lot has been done by the Greek authorities in last two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.8,0)">The primary deficit has been reduced by more than 8 pp from end-2009 to end-2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Labour market reforms are beginning to show positive results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.46,0)">But a lot still remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The Greek authorities have to demonstrate that they can continue to stick to their commitments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We are seeing encouraging signs that the fiscal targets for next year can be met.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">This is the best way out of its crisis: for Greece to reform within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.59,0)">Where does the euro area go from here?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Addressing these imbalances would go a long way towards putting the euro area on a sustainable path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.71,0)">This leads into the third question: where does the euro area go from here?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">First of all, we should acknowledge that the euro area has done a huge amount of institution-building in the last two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Few would have predicted, in early 2010, that we would today have an international treaty ensuring balanced budgets and a permanent rescue fund of 500 billion euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">But to fully restore confidence in the euro area, we also need to fix the flaws in its institutional architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The euro area is drawing up a roadmap to complete EMU based on four key pillars: financial market union, fiscal union, economic union and political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">On financial market union, progress is already being made with the agreement to establish a single supervisory for euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In order to prevent moral hazard, it is important that this is complemented with an integrated framework for bank resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">For the other unions, the roadmap aims to strengthen oversight of policies, furnish the euro area with the shock-absorbing institutions that we see in other monetary unions, and provide a proper outlet for citizens to express their views.</span>
