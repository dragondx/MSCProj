    <span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)"> Lessons from the financial crisis Keynote address by Jean-Claude Trichet,President of the European Central Bank,at the “Wirtschaftstag 2009”organised by the   Perhaps some of you here today took part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The results of the survey paint a picture that I think you will recognise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.85,0)">The firms reported that they were having difficulties in finding customers, that their turnover and profits were falling and that bank loans were harder to come by.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.71,0)">The survey also indicates that the crisis has been at least as severe for small and medium sized firms as for larger ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The results of the survey seem to be in line with our general assessment of credit conditions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Most notably, around three out of five small and medium-sized firms that had applied for a bank loan in the first half of 2009 received the requested amount in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Around one in five received the requested amount in part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.81,0)">And only about one in ten had the loan application rejected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.15,0)">Such results do not point to a severe rationing of credit, although both this survey and surveys of banks indicate that credit standards have been tightened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">We are closely monitoring the access to finance of small and medium-sized enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We will also repeat the survey every six months so as to ensure that the business conditions you face are monitored continuously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Let me now first turn to the ECB’s response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The ECB’s response to the crisis Emergencies – such as the financial “earthquake” we all experienced last autumn following the collapse of a major bank in the United States – call for swift and forceful action by the responsible authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The ECB demonstrated its alertness from the very first day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In fact, when the problems in financial markets first became apparent on 9 August 2007, we were the first central bank to respond, acting within hours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">At this point, I think it is useful to remind you of the ECB’s responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Our primary mandate is the maintenance of price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This was laid down in the Treaty on European Union, signed by Europe’s leaders in Maastricht back in 1992.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The Governing Council aims to keep inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">All our monetary policy decisions during the last eleven years have been aiming at delivering price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.21,0)">After the intensification of the crisis mid September 2008, as inflationary pressures receded, in full consistency with our mandate, we decided to reduce our policy interest rate rapidly between October 2008 and May 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">We are currently refinancing banks at 1%, an interest rate level that has not been experienced in the countries of the euro area at any time in recent history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And we have gone beyond the standard monetary policy approach of changing interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">We have adopted several “non-standard” measures that I have previously described as our policy of “enhanced credit support”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The measures were designed to ensure that our interest rate reductions were transmitted to the broader economy, despite the problems in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">In particular, the aim has been to enable banks to continue their lending to households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">To this end, we have supplied as much liquidity since October last year as banks have asked for, at fixed rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">We have also expanded the already long list of collateral that we accept in these market operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">And we have provided liquidity for longer periods than we have done in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In June this year, we conducted the first one-year operation, providing banks with credit against securities at 1% for one year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We had a record allotment of €442 billion in this operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In the second such operation, a few weeks ago in late September, we supplied banks with €75 billion, again at an interest rate of 1% for one year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">In cooperation with other central banks, we have moreover provided liquidity in foreign currencies, most notably US dollars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.13,0)">This was because euro area banks were experiencing difficulties in obtaining the foreign currency they needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">These measures can all be seen as an expansion of our normal market operations with banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In addition, since July this year, we have intervened directly in the longer-maturity segments of financial markets by buying covered bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The purpose of the purchases has been to reactivate a market that had been an important source of funding for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The measures we have implemented have been concentrated on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">You may ask why we are undertaking such efforts to support banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In the euro area, banks play a crucial role in maintaining and extending credit to all other sectors of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.48,0)">Indeed, the survey I have just mentioned told us that smaller firms in the euro area are even more dependent on banks for financing than larger firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">So, it has been essential for us to supply liquidity in an appropriate way to the euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">On the whole, we are satisfied with the results of the non-standard measures we have taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Our decisions on interest rates and liquidity have been transmitted reasonably well to the rest of the economy, despite the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.37,0)">Developments in lending have recently been subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In comparison with credit conditions during past downturns, however, the recent developments do not appear to have been unusual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.21,0)">It should not be surprising that firms and households may ask for fewer new loans during an economic downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.3,0)">Indeed, recent developments in lending are to a major extent explained by weak demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">However, supply side factors have also played a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">For a sustained recovery in credit to set in, banks will need to repair their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">On behalf of the Governing Council, I have therefore stressed continuously that banks should take appropriate measures to strengthen their capital bases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Where still necessary, banks should also take full advantage of government measures to support the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">One year after the dramatic deepening of the financial crisis in September 2008, we can observe more and more signs of economic stabilisation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.66,0)">We have halted the freefall in economic activity that we witnessed around the turn of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">There are reasons to believe that a gradual recovery lies ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But the uncertainty surrounding this outlook remains high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">* * * Exceptional times have called for exceptional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.27,0)">As the situation normalises, the non-standard measures need to be phased out, and the substantial policy stimulus must be withdrawn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We at the ECB have designed our non-standard measures with an exit strategy in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.91,0)">It is still premature to declare the financial crisis to be over.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But when the appropriate time comes, there should not be any concern about the ECB’s ability to exit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Indeed, most of our non-standard measures will be phased out naturally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Furthermore, we have a clearly defined mandate and complete independence, which ensure that we can act when we believe it to be appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Over the past decade, we have established a strong track record for acting in a way that is independent, timely and fully in line with our mandate to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Central banks are not the only authorities that need a credible exit strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The governments, too, need such a strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Their response was instrumental in avoiding a collapse of the financial system and in halting the sharp decline in economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.87,0)">But that response also entailed significant costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.64,0)">The debt and budget deficits of a number of euro area governments have reached worrying levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">That is why there is an increasingly pressing need for ambitious and realistic fiscal exit strategies and for fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The global community’s response to the financial crisis Let me now turn to the global response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">In my view, there are three main lessons to be learnt: first, the need to build a more resilient financial sector; second, the need to implement solutions at the global level; and third, the need for all policy-makers to contribute to financial, macroeconomic and price stability over the medium and longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">At the outset, it is worth acknowledging the fundamental role that the financial sector plays in the functioning of our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">It is a key part of the services sector, the infrastructure that makes it possible for us to do our jobs and run our businesses efficiently and effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The basic role of the financial sector is to channel funds from savers to investors, from lenders to borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">This facilitates the efficient allocation of resources and the efficient diversification of risk both within an economy and across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">But looking back on the years before the crisis erupted, we can see that there was a dramatic shift in focus in large parts of the financial sector – away from facilitating business, trade and real investment towards unfettered speculation and financial gambling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Financial liberalisation, deregulation and innovation all have the potential to make our economies more productive and resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.4,0)">But if financial innovation is ill-designed and opaque, it can be used to conceal the true risk of financial products and instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.97,0)">The current crisis developed because individual risks in the financial sector were underpriced and systemic risk was underestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.33,0)">Several authorities, including some central banks, had warned about the possibility of abrupt repricing in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.16,0)">These warnings date back to 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.24,0)">However, while it was perceived that a storm was brewing, it was not known exactly what would trigger it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.78,0)">Looking forward, the financial sector will have to return to its traditional role of providing a service to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.17,0)">This, above all, requires a change in mentality within the financial industry itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">More specifically, the financial industry has to increase transparency, strengthen its management of liquidity and risk, and make its business models more robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">It will also need to align the incentives of its employees to longer-term success rather than short-term profits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.75,0)">Our fellow citizens will not tolerate a relapse into excessive risk-taking at the expense of taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Financial regulation and supervision will be significantly enhanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Financial regulation will have to focus on strengthening banks’ capital buffers, making compensation more consistent with long-term success and improving the transparency of financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.56,0)">Financial supervision will have to focus on detecting developments in the financial sector that could eventually lead to systemic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">This brings me to my second point, namely that there is an overwhelming need to implement reform simultaneously and homogeneously at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.05,0)">The crisis has shown that no country can escape the shock waves of a financial meltdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.87,0)">Accordingly, any reform effort that stops at national borders will prove futile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">For us in Europe, international cooperation on financial reform has two dimensions: first, cooperation within the European Union and, second, cooperation across the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Institutional reform within the European Union follows a two-pronged approach: first, there is the creation of the European System of Financial Supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">This is aimed at achieving better coordination among national authorities responsible for financial regulation, in particular with respect to how they coordinate the monitoring of activities of European financial institutions that cross national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Second, there is the creation of the European Systemic Risk Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">This new body will endeavour to provide early-warnings and issue recommendations that will help to prevent a renewed build-up of excessive risk in the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The ECB and the National Central Banks in the EU will play a key role in this new institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">But close cooperation must not halt at Europe’s borders either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Given the strong interlinks between financial centres, a global approach is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">* * * Governance in the global economy has evolved substantially over the past few decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">At the time of the first oil crisis in the mid-1970s, the major industrialised countries saw the need for an international body to allow a regular exchange of information between major economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">This paved the way for the creation of the G‑7.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The G‑7 assembled the seven economies that were most important at the time for world output and international trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Today, the ECB together with three national central banks represents the Eurosystem in the G‑7.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">While the G-7 still have an important role to play, the financial crisis has confirmed the need to reinforce global governance at the level of a more inclusive international informal entity, bringing together the major countries and global institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Three weeks ago, at the Pittsburgh summit, it was decided to make the G‑20 the premier forum for international economic cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I personally have been involved in the G‑7 discussions in various functions for 22 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The G‑7 remain a useful forum for exchange among the major industrialised economies which, after all, share a major responsibility in the origin of the recent crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I also witnessed the creation of the G‑20 after the Asian crisis of the late 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">It was an important step to involve the emerging economies more closely in the process of global economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">And I am therefore in the present very demanding circumstances, in full accord with this strengthened role of the G‑20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The aspect that impresses me most about this emerging global forum is the virtually universal consensus on global economic issues that has been reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">There is a broad consensus at the level of the G‑20 on the diagnosis of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">There is a broad consensus on the appropriate response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">And there is a broad consensus on the direction of financial sector reform, along with the main ideas I described a moment ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">There is also agreement that macroeconomic policies at the domestic level need to be consistent with the objective of global financial and economic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.66,0)">Global macroeconomic imbalances were a fundamental driver of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">What is needed going forward is to eradicate short-termism in macroeconomic policy and to replace it with a medium-term orientation that enhances stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This focus on the medium term, which is a core element of the ECB’s monetary policy strategy, has greatly facilitated our task of maintaining price stability in the euro area, both at times of heightened inflationary pressures and at times of deflationary risks stemming from financial distress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">I am convinced that a clear commitment to a medium-term orientation will have beneficial effects in all policy areas and all regions of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">All these efforts will help to create an environment that is conducive to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">But success hinges first and foremost on a significant change of behaviour and risk management within the financial industry itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Policy-makers, supervisors and regulators around the world will have to ensure that the financial industry does indeed draw the appropriate lessons from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Conclusion I have spoken about the lessons to be learnt from the financial crisis, and about the progress made so far in repairing the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Central banks and governments around the world have taken bold action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">This action has borne fruit and revived what seemed a very scarce resource to me only a few months ago: confidence in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">More needs to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">The agenda for financial reform recently agreed at the G‑20 needs to be implemented decisively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.01,0)">The financial industry needs to change fundamentally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">It needs to put more emphasis on robust business models, sound balance sheets and far better management of liquidity and risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Macroeconomic policy-makers around the globe need to renew their commitment to medium-term stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">We should also not forget that the need for structural reforms over and beyond the financial sector is more urgent than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.01,0)">The financial and economic crisis has revealed structural weaknesses even more clearly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.89,0)">The financial crisis has not eliminated the need for structural reform in other areas; it has merely displaced them from the headlines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Reforms to tackle the impact of demographic ageing and to strengthen Europe’s potential for future growth in output remain clear priorities for policy-makers in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">* * * Erlauben Sie mir zum Schluss, einige Worte zur Rolle des Euro zu sagen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Die letzten zwei Jahre haben uns seinen Wert vor Augen geführt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Der Euro ist keineswegs nur eine Schönwetterwährung.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Er hat sich als Stabilitätsanker in stürmischer   Das wichtigste Beschlussorgan für den Euro ist der EZB-Rat, in dem wir – die Direktoriumsmitglieder der EZB und die Präsidenten der nationalen Zentralbanken im Eurogebiet – unsere Entscheidungen kollegial treffen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Da ich hier in Deutschland spreche, möchte ich meine EZB-Ratskollegen Jürgen Stark und Axel Weber erwähnen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In der Vergangenheit haben Mitglieder wie Hans Tietmeyer und Otmar Issing entscheidende Beiträge geleistet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Ohne den Euro wären Spannungen zwischen den Ländern im Eurogebiet nicht auszuschließen gewesen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Dies hätte unseren Unternehmen zusätzlich zu schaffen gemacht.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Im Rückblick kann man die Einführung des Euro vor knapp elf Jahren als eine weise und vorausschauende Antwort Europas auf die Herausforderungen von heute sehen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Sie und alle 330 Millionen Bürgerinnen und Bürger des Eurogebiets können sich darauf verlassen: Die EZB wird ihre Verantwortung für eine stabile europäische Währung auch weiterhin wahrnehmen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Ich danke Ihnen für Ihre Aufmerksamkeit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.25,0)">The remainder includes the category “don’t know”.</span>
