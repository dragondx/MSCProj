    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)"> Introductory remarks at the French Assemblée Nationale Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB,Paris, 26 June 2013 Presidents, Honourable Members of Parliament, I would like to thank you very warmly for having invited me to address this historic chamber.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">As President of the European Central Bank, it is an honour to speak in a nation that has done so much to promote and further the cause of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It was exactly 300 years ago, in 1713, that the Abbé de Saint-Pierre presented his Project for Perpetual Peace, one of the first visions for a union between European nations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">That this vision emerged into reality is thanks in large part to generations of French thinkers and pioneers, like Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Victor Hugo, and Aristide Briand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It is also thanks to the makers of the modern European Union like Robert Schuman, Jean Monnet, and Jacques Delors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">In other words, this country has played a key role in building the peaceful, open and united Europe we see today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.48,0)">But as you know, the EU, and the euro area in particular, is faced with important questions about its direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">It needs a new consensus on how to move forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">I am confident that France will again play a key role in that process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In my introductory remarks today, I would like to focus on three topics: the ECB’s monetary policy, growth and adjustment in the euro area, and the progress towards building a deeper economic and monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I am here today to present the ECB’s views, but also to listen and to learn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">I look forward to hearing your opinions and taking your questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy Let me begin with the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The ECB’s mandate is to maintain price stability, which is essential to support long-term growth, defend citizens’ purchasing power and maintain sustainable and high employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In order to deliver our mandate, the ECB has done a great deal to support the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.94,0)">First, we have reduced our main interest rate to the historic low of 0.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Second, we have introduced a series of measures to ensure that banks can pass on these low interest rates to borrowers in the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">These measures include allowing banks to borrow as much liquidity from the ECB as they need; expanding the range of collateral they can use to access that liquidity; intervening in bond markets that were malfunctioning, like the sovereign bond market or the covered bond market; and launching two three-year Long-Term Refinancing Operations  , which injected more than 1 trillion euro into the euro area banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Overall, our balance sheet increased from just below 1.5 trillion euro before the crisis to more than 3 trillion euro at its peak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Our measures are primarily focused on banks because, in the euro area, bank lending is the main channel through which firms and households get access to finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Around three quarters of firms’ external financing comes from banks, compared with only around one quarter in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Supporting the banking system is therefore essential to support growth in the euro area – and to fulfil our mandate to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">More recently, the ECB has acted to remove unfounded fears about the future integrity of our monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.48,0)">These fears were creating severe turbulence in financial markets and preventing our low interest rates from reaching the countries where they were needed most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.44,0)">As a result, we saw a risk of a widespread credit crunch in these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.08,0)">Questions over fiscal sustainability and growing market distrust were starting to spill over into their respective banking sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.01,0)">The effects for growth and employment would have been severe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.09,0)">Indeed, investors were suddenly losing confidence that the euro area could survive in its current composition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.82,0)">The prospect that claims on governments and private companies in certain countries could not be discharged in euros had become a possibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Our response was to introduce the programme of Outright Monetary Transactions  , which allows for ex ante unlimited interventions in sovereign debt markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">OMT has been effective in restoring market functioning and trust in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">For example, since the OMT announcement, bond markets have steadied, providing discipline without becoming destructive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.99,0)">Spreads on long-term bonds for Spain, Italy and Ireland have declined by around 150-250 basis points, and for Portugal by almost 500 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">And this has helped reduce financial fragmentation within the euro area, as shown by the best indicator we have for fragmentation, the level of Target balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.41,0)">These have declined by 285 billion euros, or 25%, since the peak last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">France, like all other member states, has benefited significantly from this stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">In short, the ECB has been very active in responding to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">We have robustly defended the stability of our monetary union and therefore of our money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">And we stand ready to act again when needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">However, it is important to acknowledge that there are limits to what monetary policy can achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is not a question of the scope of our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.39,0)">It is fundamentally about what different institutions are empowered to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.01,0)">One pertinent example is the current shortage of credit for many households and small- and medium-sized enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Credit provision requires funding, capital and a positive risk assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">The central bank can help ensure funding and address macroeconomic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.78,0)">But it cannot provide capital, nor can it affect banks’ assessment of the creditworthiness of individual borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Similarly, monetary policy cannot create real economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.59,0)">If growth is stalling because the economy is not producing enough or because firms have lost competitiveness, this is beyond the power of the central bank to fix.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Yet, the euro area needs sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.63,0)">There are currently more than 19 million people unemployed in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.36,0)">Almost a quarter of young people are out of work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.44,0)">Such high levels of joblessness are a tragedy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.72,0)">Moreover, a weak economy means fewer taxpayers and lower revenues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.87,0)">This puts pressure on public finances, and ultimately on our social models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">So what is the best way to achieve the growth Europe needs?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me turn to this issue now and share with you some reflections on this subject.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Growth and adjustment in the euro area Some euro area countries have in the past relied on debt to support growth and fund social spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.82,0)">But this path has led them to a difficult situation today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.03,0)">They have ended up with high public debts while growth has steadily fallen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">In this country, for instance, public debt has risen from around 20% of GDP in 1980 to over 90% of GDP today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In that time, annual GDP growth averaged 2.3% in the 1980s, 1.9% in the 1990s, and 1.8% in the 2000s up to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">This suggests that, for all euro area countries, a new approach is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">An approach that can deliver growth and jobs, and sustain social models, without creating an unsustainable debt burden for future generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In my view, this requires two complementary responses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The first response is to ensure that fiscal consolidation, which is necessary to contain debt levels, is made as growth-friendly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">For instance, relying less on tax increases would help sustain citizens’ disposable income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Prioritising capital investment over current spending would do more to lay the foundations for future growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Structural fiscal reforms, for example to pension systems, would also help support fiscal sustainability without negative effects on the economy today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The second response is to raise competitiveness and increase the underlying productive capacity of our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Here, the frontier is reforms that target the structure of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">These include reducing barriers to entry for new firms and young people, and removing burdens on business like complex tax and labour laws or distortionary regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Reforms to the labour market are also essential to create the highest possible opportunities for employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.39,0)">We are already seeing progress on rebalancing in the euro area: unit labour costs are coming down in countries where they had grown excessively; current account deficits are narrowing where there had been large imbalances in the past; and export growth is generally picking up in countries under strain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.9,0)">But in many euro area countries, the gap the between wages and productivity is still out of line with competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">To increase employment, this gap should be closed and all the many policy levers that can contribute to this should be used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Changes to two-tier employment systems that protect insiders and harm outsiders are one such lever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.09,0)">Let us not forget that those who suffer the most from unreformed labour markets are often young people, as evidenced by the very high levels of youth employment today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">I therefore welcome the joint initiative of the French and German Labour ministers to tackle this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">This underscores an important point about reforms: by restoring competitiveness and creating opportunities for a wider range of people, they benefit the many, not the few.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Reforms are an expression of solidarity between citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Solidarity across countries is also important, but it would be meaningless without solidarity within countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Building a stronger EMU What role can the euro area as a whole play in supporting growth and stability across Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Governments are today reflecting deeply on this question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">They are considering what was missing in the original design of Economic and Monetary Union  : what responsibilities need to be shared at the European level, and what not, to make EMU function effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In my view, this debate should be driven by a single question: how can we best protect the vital interests of euro area citizens?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">And where the answer involves transferring sovereignty to the European level, we should not hesitate to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The best example of this is Banking Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Banking Union is essential to ensure that we make permanent the progress made in reintegrating financial markets; that financial conditions in both core and periphery countries return to normal; and that our monetary union becomes truly single again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">It has two indispensable elements: a strong Single Supervisory Mechanism   and a strong Single Resolution Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">A strong system of common supervision is key to increase confidence in the health of euro area banks, which has been damaged due to supervisory failures in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Progress is already well underway here, and the Single Supervisory Mechanism will take over supervision one year after the legislation is adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But to ensure that common supervision is credible, it needs to be accompanied by a mechanism that can wind down failing banks without causing financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is why we need a Single Resolution Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">And it needs to have a strong European dimension to be able to deal effectively with large, cross-border banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.07,0)">But Banking Union is not the only example of where closer union is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Ultimately, the euro area needs to be drawing closer in all fields of economic policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The recent call from the leaders of France and Germany for closer economic union shows that this message is being understood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But it is important that form is fully aligned with substance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In my view, a true economic union means three things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">First, it means every country ensuring its national economy functions properly, without external imbalances and high unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">We cannot have a strong economic union without strong national economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Second, it means transferring some sovereignty over decision-making to the European level – accepting decisions that are made for the good of the euro area as a whole, even if, at that moment in time, individual countries may disagree with them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Third, it means applying the same rules to all members of monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">This is not only a condition of fairness between countries, but also a pre-condition for deeper integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Only if there is trust that each member will play by the rules can a union of mutual solidarity become possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For these reasons, moving towards closer economic union also requires an equivalent deepening of political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Greater authority at the European level must be matched by greater democratic legitimacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And here both the European Parliament and national parliaments have a key role to play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.98,0)">As Herman van Rompuy has reminded us, national parliaments have become EU institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Conclusion Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The euro area has made much progress in recent years, but it still faces many challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Solving them requires EU institutions and national governments to work in concert.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The ECB has done as much as it can to stabilise markets and support the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Now governments and parliaments need to do all they can to raise growth potential, strengthen competitiveness and build a stronger, more stable EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I was impressed to learn that, back in 1871, Victor Hugo called in this Assembly for a United States of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">France today can be equally ambitious in taking the euro area forward.</span>
