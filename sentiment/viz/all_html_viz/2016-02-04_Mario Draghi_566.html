    <h1> How central banks meet the challenge of low inflation </h1>
    <h2> Marjolin lecture delivered by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the SUERF conference organised by the Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt, 4 February 2016 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)"> How central banks meet the challenge of low inflation Marjolin lecture delivered by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the SUERF conference organised by the Deutsche Bundesbank,Frankfurt, 4 February 2016 Robert Marjolin was a pivotal figure in the birth of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">When the Treaty of Rome was signed in 1957, the aims of European Economic Community were largely limited to creating a customs union and a common agricultural market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Neither was perceived to require monetary integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">It was only with the launch of the so-called “Marjolin Memorandum” in 1962 that the recognition surfaced that a single market and a single money were linked and that a serious discussion on European monetary integration began.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Today, more than 60 years on, monetary integration in the euro area is both complete and secure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.66,0)">But monetary policy faces many challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Those challenges have not changed our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.74,0)">But they have altered the way in which we deliver it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">To understand how we have responded to those challenges, it is useful to distinguish between two types.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">First, there are challenges that are common to all central banks in advanced economies, which are linked to a global low inflation environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Second, there are challenges that are special to us in the euro area, which are linked to our particular institutional context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">What is common for all The most fundamental question facing all major central banks today is this: can our price stability mandates still be delivered?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Across advanced economies inflation is low, and has been low for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.35,0)">And in several of those economies, long-term inflation expectations, based on market prices, remain below our numerical definitions of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.25,0)">That has led some to question whether it makes sense for central banks to pursue expansionary policies to meet their inflation objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.12,0)">Are they fighting a futile battle against forces beyond their control?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.21,0)">There are essentially three lines of argument in favour of monetary policy not reacting to the low inflation we see today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.62,0)">The causes of too low inflation The first line of argument is that low inflation is increasingly being caused by structural factors in the global economy that cannot be addressed through domestic monetary stimulus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.99,0)">As a result, it is said, previous notions of what we considered low and stable inflation – inflation rates around 2% – are no longer realistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.3,0)">Central banks should adjust their objectives downwards accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.96,0)">If this argument were accurate, it would constitute a very fundamental criticism of central banks’ mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">After all, the decision to grant central banks price stability objectives, and to give them independence to deliver those objectives, was based on the understanding that inflation is always, ultimately, a monetary phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It could thus always be controlled in the medium-term by a committed monetary authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.92,0)">So is it true that structural changes we see today are having a permanent impact on long-term inflation levels?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.97,0)">One such change that is often mentioned in this respect is demographic change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This certainly heralds important economic shifts, but its impact on inflation is ex ante unclear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.13,0)">It might put downward pressure on prices if aggregate demand falls more than aggregate supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.89,0)">But it might equally create upward price pressures: according to the life-cycle hypothesis, an ageing population implies that the elderly eventually dissave and consume more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Which effect dominates will depend on a range of factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.4,0)">In any event, it seems unlikely that demography can explain why inflation is low today across advanced economies that have very different demographic profiles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.4,0)">Moreover, even if ageing were to lead to a period of disinflation, for example through savings and investment imbalances, there is no reason why that should imply a permanently lower inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.78,0)">An excess of savings would simply mean that the equilibrium real interest rate required to deliver price stability would be lower, and the central bank would have to factor that into its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Put another way, the effects of ageing would call for us to adjust our instruments, but not our objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.12,0)">Other structural shifts are also seen by some as having a long-term impact on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.6,0)">One is the fact that the long-term cycle in commodity prices is now going into reverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Another is technological change, especially e-commerce, which increases price transparency and intensifies competition between suppliers and retailers, which may keep prices low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">A third is globalisation, which may increase the importance of global prices relative to domestic prices, making it harder for advanced economies to avoid importing disinflation from abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.46,0)">Each of these changes might have an influence on the inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We cannot deny that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.87,0)">But there is nothing about them which suggests these effects are permanent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.67,0)">For example, permanent changes in the supply of energy are likely to have a permanent effect on the price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">But at some point energy price disinflation must reverse, if only due to base effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Similarly, the price-containing impact of e-commerce, if any, will last only until the diffusion of e-commerce has stabilised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">And lower imported inflation thanks to globalisation should eventually lead to higher prices elsewhere, as disposable income increases and the levels of wages and other costs equalise across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So there is no reason why any of these structural changes should make our current price stability objectives unobtainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.2,0)">They may create global disinflationary forces, but those forces are transitory in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.68,0)">What can affect our objective, however, is if those forces have a persistent impact on inflation – which is to say, if they become embedded in inflation dynamics and inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.7,0)">But that is not a structural issue; it is about the credibility of monetary policy in anchoring inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.66,0)">This brings me to the second line of argument against active monetary policy The response to too low inflation There are some who argue that, so long as we are experiencing mainly positive global supply shocks, there is no need for central banks to be overly responsive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We can simply redefine the medium-term horizon over which price stability is maintained and “wait it out” until inflation returns to our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.77,0)">Indeed, the reason central banks do not define the medium-term as a period of calendar time is that the horizon for action depends on the nature of the shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This viewpoint is correct, as far as it goes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.7,0)">Central banks do typically refrain from reacting to supply shocks that have opposing effects on output and inflation, so as not to overreact and reinforce the effect on growth, in either direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.77,0)">And that might even be the case when faced with a succession of supply shocks, such as the steep falls in oil prices we have experienced recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.51,0)">Each shock should in principle have a short duration and should not have a persistent effect on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.13,0)">However, since there is always a backward-looking component in inflation developments, the longer inflation stays too low, the greater the risk that inflation does not return automatically to target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.95,0)">Specifically, if agents start to look at the track record of recent inflation, rather than the inflation objective, it affects their benchmarks for wage and price setting decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.88,0)">What happens then is that low inflation feeds into inflation expectations and creates second-round effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.55,0)">In that situation, even what began as a positive supply shock can turn into a negative demand shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.2,0)">As inflation expectations fall, it pushes up real interest rates, producing an unwarranted monetary tightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.69,0)">And the unexpected low inflation raises real debt burdens, which has a negative effect on aggregate demand due to the different propensities to consume and invest of borrowers and lenders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.57,0)">Output and inflation, then move again in the same direction – but this time downwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.78,0)">For that reason, in a context of prolonged low inflation, monetary policy cannot be relaxed about a succession of supply shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.43,0)">Adopting a wait-and-see attitude and extending the policy horizon brings with it risks: namely a lasting de-anchoring of expectations leading to persistently weaker inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">And if that were to happen, we would need a much more accommodative monetary policy to reverse it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In sum, even when faced with protracted global shocks, it is still monetary policy that determines medium-term price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">If we do not “surrender” to low inflation – and we certainly do not – in the steady state it will return to levels consistent with our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.48,0)">If on the other hand we capitulate to “inexorable disinflationary forces”, or invoke long periods of transition for inflation to come down, we will in fact only perpetuate disinflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This is the clear lesson of monetary history, especially the experience of the 1970s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.91,0)">At that time, many policymakers argued that persistently high inflation was structural and central bankers could do little to reduce it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.4,0)">For example, in May 1971, when Arthur Burns was Chairman, the official staff presentation to the FOMC declared – like some of our critics today – that “the question is whether monetary policy could or should do anything to combat a persisting residual rate of inflation … the answer, I think, is negative … it seems to me that we should regard continuing cost increases as a structural problem not amenable to macroeconomic measures”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.79,0)">Similarly, Fed Chairman William Miller observed in his first FOMC meeting in March 1978 that, “inflation is going to be left to the Federal Reserve and that’s going to be bad news.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">An effective program to reduce the rate of inflation has to extend beyond monetary policy and needs to be complemented by programs designed to enhance competition and to correct structural problems”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It was only when Paul   Monetary policy should not try to balance opposing objectives: it is optimal for all parties if it delivers its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And if that creates financial stability concerns, they need to be addressed by other policies more suited to the task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">And in fact there are several policy levers available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Countries can improve their financial regulation and supervision to make their financial systems more resilient to external shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">They can adjust their fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">They can adopt macro-prudential measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">The evidence suggests that such policies can be effective: emerging market countries differ significantly in their sensitivity to global financial developments on account of their policy frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">We also have some anecdotal evidence that macro-prudential measures are working in Asian economies, especially in cooling off the real estate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.1,0)">Finally, these general considerations aside, it is worth questioning whether such arguments about monetary policy spillovers actually hold for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">For example, if we look at spillovers into asset prices, there is no evidence that the announcement of the APP induced a surge in portfolio flows into emerging market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">In fact, empirical evidence suggests that global investors rebalanced out of emerging market bond and equity markets into bond markets of advanced economies, in particular in the euro area, in response to the APP launch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And if we look at foreign currency debt, while low euro area interest rates have led to significant increases in euro-denominated debt security issuance outside the euro area in the past two years, issues in euro still only account for about one-quarter of international bond issuance, while issues in dollar account for two-thirds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">What is more, recent foreign bond issuance in euro is dominated by investment grade US corporates, and among the emerging markets, highly-rated issuers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.08,0)">The evidence of unhealthy spillovers and financial stability risks therefore seems limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">What is special to us So even in the face of common global shocks, central banks have the ability to deliver their mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But in the euro area, that requires a different monetary policy response than for others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.29,0)">That is because we also face a second set of challenges that are largely specific to us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">They result from our institutional structure: conducting monetary policy in a segmented banking and capital market, and without a single area-wide fiscal authority as a counterpart.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">There are two types of challenges in particular that emerge from this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Transmitting the stance The first relates to monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.88,0)">Many central banks have faced impairments in the transmission process during the crisis – that is why, for example, the Fed began intervening in markets for mortgage-backed securities, or the Bank of England launched its funding-for-lending programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.26,0)">But it is clear that those impairments have been more severe in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And moreover, they have had a distinct regional dimension that was not visible in other jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.8,0)">Our specific challenge arises from having an incomplete banking and capital market, which leads to lower sharing of risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.0,0)">Relative to a fully integrated market, portfolios of private assets in the euro area are less geographically diversified, concentrating the effect of local economic slumps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.72,0)">Credit markets are less integrated, making it harder for agents to borrow from other parts of the union to smooth out such shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.4,0)">And institutions for cross-border public risk-sharing are less developed, placing the full burden of dealing with the after-effects on individual sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.58,0)">This has two consequences for monetary transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.79,0)">First, it means that some of the main transmission channels – namely the bank lending channel and the balance sheet channel – are more likely to be disrupted in the event of major shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And second, since private risk and sovereign risk are linked at the national level, it means that financial fragmentation takes place along national lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.23,0)">That hampers the traction of monetary policy in the regions where monetary stimulus is most needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.65,0)">None of this means we cannot fulfill our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.97,0)">But it does mean we have to design our instruments to compensate for it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">That is why, for large parts of the crisis, our measures were also geared towards addressing impairments in the smooth transmission of our policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.44,0)">Early on in the crisis, this meant substituting for the drying up of the interbank market, including at longer maturities, to ensure the flow of cross-border liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Later, we took out unwarranted redenomination risks from sovereign debt markets, helping attenuate the bank-sovereign nexus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">More recently, we have launched a credit easing package which aims, among other things, to ensure that bank deleveraging does not produce excessive dispersion in lending rates across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The evidence suggests that each of these measures has been successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Still, it is clear that fragmentation risks can only be definitively removed by addressing their institutional drivers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">That is why the creation of Banking Union, which is the topic of our conference today, was such a fundamental addition to monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">The Single Supervisory Mechanism provides a framework for a more integrated banking market, which would be less likely to fragment under stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The Single Resolution Mechanism facilitates greater risk-sharing across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">And the commitment to develop a Capital Markets Union is the first step towards greater geographical diversification, especially in cross-border holdings of equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">What is still missing, however, is agreement on the third leg of Banking Union – deposit insurance – which is an essential part of a genuinely single money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">For this reason, the Commission’s proposal to establish a European Deposit Insurance Scheme is welcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">On the one hand, it sets out the ambitious objective of establishing a truly European system of depositors’ protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">That will support the creation of an internal market for deposits in which the fungibility of deposits is assured independently of jurisdictions, and trust in deposits is equalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">On the other, it is realistic in its design and provides a number of safeguards against moral hazard, so that risk-sharing does not become risk-shedding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">“Risk reduction” and “risk-sharing” measures are two sides of the same coin and should be pursued in parallel: they are both essential to protect the stability of the European banking sector and ensure a homogenous transmission of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Expanding the stance The second, specific challenge we have faced in the euro area has come when we needed to expand our monetary stance – specifically, when we shifted from interest rates as the main instrument of monetary policy to asset purchases via the APP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">In part, large-scale asset purchases aim at reducing the risk-free rate by taking out duration from the market for sovereign bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the euro area, however, we do not have a single risk-free rate since we do not have a single fiscal issuer that acts as a benchmark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.34,0)">And there is no national market which could act as a substitute, not only due to volume constraints, but also because no government security in the euro area is truly risk-free.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.62,0)">The prohibition on monetary financing means that every sovereign bond carries a degree of credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In this context, asset purchases of the size we deemed appropriate must inevitably be implemented in multiple markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.42,0)">And that means monetary policy operations may unwittingly impact on credit allocation across regions and types of borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.21,0)">That is not unusual – all monetary policy has allocative consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Nor does it create a limit on us fulfilling our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">But it does require that we aim to mitigate those consequences, under the constraint that we achieve our price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">That can be done in two ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The first is by designing our monetary policy instruments in a way that minimises distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We did this under the APP by intervening mainly in the most “commoditised” asset classes, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">the government bond markets in each country, and by spreading our interventions proportionally across jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">That effectively constructs a diversified pan-euro area portfolio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Second, allocative effects can also be reduced by further integrating the markets in which we intervene, in particular government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">To that end, a robust fiscal framework which is enforced credibly would reduce the risk inherent in individual government bonds in the euro area, which would in turn make the impact of interventions in different markets more homogenous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Still, there can be no doubt that if we needed to adopt a more expansionary policy, the risk of side effects would not stand in our way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We always aim to limit the distortions caused by our policy, but what comes first is the price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">That is the implication of the principle of monetary dominance, which is embedded in the Treaty and which lends monetary policy its credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Monetary dominance means that we can – indeed we should – acknowledge and draw attention to all the consequences, intended or unintended, of our monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But it also means that we should never fail to deliver on our mandate solely on account of those consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.29,0)">Doing so would be tantamount to redrafting our mandate under the law, something we are not at liberty to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Conclusion Let me summarise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.55,0)">There are forces in the global economy today that are conspiring to hold inflation down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Those forces might cause inflation to return more slowly to our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.15,0)">But there is no reason why they should lead to a permanently lower inflation rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What matters is that central banks act within their mandates to fulfill their mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In the euro area, that might create different challenges than it does in other jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">But those challenges can be mitigated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.15,0)">They do not justify inaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Most empirical results that find ageing is disinflationary have focused on Japan, as its transition from aging society to aged society is one of the fastest  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.48,0)">However, a recent BIS working paper by Juselius and Takats   contradicts the prevailing view: looking at low-frequency correlations, they find that a larger share of young or old cohorts is associated with higher inflation, while a larger share of working-age cohorts is correlated with lower inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.31,0)">This highlights how difficult it is to quantify the impact of this structural factor on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.09,0)">"Can demography affect inflation and monetary policy?”, BIS Working Papers 485, Bank for
