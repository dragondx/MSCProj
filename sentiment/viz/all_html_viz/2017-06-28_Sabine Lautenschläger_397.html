    <span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)"> Harmonisation paves the way for a European banking market Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority 15th anniversary event, Bonn, 28 June 2017 There are two questions on the future of European regulation that we have to answer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">First, will regulation continue to be shaped by global standards?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.74,0)">Second, how “European” must regulation in Europe be?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Regarding the first question, I am still a firm supporter of global regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The financial crisis of 2008 showed us the interconnections of the global banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.62,0)">If a bank fails, it can destabilise markets worldwide and nationally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The stability of the system can only be ensured by global rules, and that’s exactly what the Basel Committee is working on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">So once the Committee has concluded its work on Basel III this year, all the major financial markets should implement the new standards – in Europe and elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.94,0)">And in that context I find the most recent proposals by the US Department of the Treasury worrying.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.2,0)">It looks as if elements of the global reform might be postponed or not even implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This involves important areas such as the new rules on the trading book.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In my view, purely national initiatives will not improve the stability of the financial system, quite the opposite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It is all the more important that the EU implements the Basel standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The rules should be harmonised as far as possible for Europe’s banking market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.53,0)">And this brings us to the second question: how “European” must regulation in Europe be?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The single market is a key element of a united Europe, and we also need a single European market for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This involves harmonising the rules for banks – wherever it makes sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">But we should not forget that the European banking sector is characterised by diversity, not least as a result of national specificities, because this diversity contributes to the stability of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">What we need, then, is a balance between harmonisation and diversity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">There are some areas that require greater harmonisation and other areas that require less.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For example, small banks in the euro area need somewhat less harmonisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Taken in isolation, a small bank poses a limited risk to the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">It only becomes problematic if many small banks run into trouble at the same time, and for this eventuality we need sound institutional protection schemes that are ready to be activated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.67,0)">Overall, though, the rules for small banks can be less strict than for big banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And this is already the case: in many respects smaller banks have an easier life than the large ones – for example, in financial reporting and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.74,0)">Should a further easing of the rules be discussed, this would however throw up a difficult question: how big, or rather how small, should a bank be to be considered for this easing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What are the right thresholds?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">In other areas, we need greater harmonisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.54,0)">That becomes apparent when you take a closer look at the European rules – they are neither uniform nor complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Certain areas of supervision which would benefit from a single European rule continue to be determined by national regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let’s take the example of a British bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.09,0)">In the event of a “hard Brexit” the bank could lose its EU passport, which gives it access to the internal market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">In order to continue to do business in the internal market, it would need to establish a base in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Ideally, the country in which it sets up its business should be an unimportant factor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.92,0)">But it is not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Despite the banking union, location still plays an important role in a bank’s life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.68,0)">If a British bank conducts its business via a branch in the euro area, then it is subject to national supervision and national rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.97,0)">This results in the bank having different capital and liquidity requirements, depending on the country where the bank has set up its branch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Of course, the bank will also look closely at the different national recovery and resolution conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.25,0)">And they have only been marginally harmonised, so there is no uniform toolset for crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.71,0)">For instance, I have sorely missed the opportunity to declare a moratorium recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.01,0)">The examples I have mentioned show how many national barriers are still blocking the way to a European banking market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In Europe too the principle for banks should be: same business, same risks, same rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.93,0)">This ensures fair competition and prevents banks from exploiting regulatory differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Ultimately, harmonised rules pave the way for a stable banking market.</span>
