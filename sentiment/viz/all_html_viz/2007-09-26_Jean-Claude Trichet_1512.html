    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)"> The monetary policy implications of ageing Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBABP Conference on Pension Diversity and Solidarity in Europe,Maastricht / Heerlen, 26 September 2007   Ladies and gentlemen,   I would like to thank the ABP Pension Fund for inviting me to this Conference on Pension Diversity and Solidarity in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">It is a pleasure to stand in front of such a distinguished audience to discuss one of the challenges to be confronted by many economies around the globe, a challenge that will be with us for the next decades: ageing and its macroeconomic implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The ageing of the population in most industrialised economies and in the euro area in particular can be best characterised by a number of major demographic developments that have taken place over the last 60 years  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.0,0)">First, the baby-boom generation is moving closer to retirement age, while the fertility rate has almost halved in the euro area since the 1960s and now lies below the replacement rate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">And second, people live longer: more precisely, life expectancy has lengthened by eight years in the last four decades  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">As a result, the old-age dependency ratio, defined as the number of individuals over the age of 65 per working-age person, is expected to almost double in the euro area over the next four decades  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">More importantly, in the absence of significant structural reforms, the old-age economic dependency ratio, which is the number of individuals over the age of 65 per employed person, in the European economies could jump from 0.9 in 1995 to 1.2 by 2050.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.09,0)">These developments could have significant macroeconomic effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.22,0)">For instance, according to estimates from the European Commission and the Economic Policy Committee’s Ageing Working Group, the potential growth rate of output in the euro area could fall from 2.1% on average over the period 2004-2010 to 1.2% on average over the period 2031-2050   accompanied by significant declines in savings and investment rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Not surprisingly, therefore, increasing attention is being paid to the economic implications of demographic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">In Europe, the analysis carried out under the auspices of the Economic Policy Committee’s Ageing Working Group has significantly raised awareness of the effects of ageing on the fiscal burden among policy-makers and amongst the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In my remarks today, however, I will take a different but complementary perspective, and focus on the impact that ageing populations can have on the macroeconomic environment in which central banks operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In this regard, the demographic developments I have just described are not the types of shock that may trigger significant and immediate monetary policy responses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.48,0)">This notwithstanding, financial markets may already be anticipating some of the effects of population ageing on asset prices, which are of indisputable relevance for monetary policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Consequently, in this speech I would like to share with you some thoughts based on the findings of the economic literature regarding, first, the effects of demographic change on the main macroeconomic variables and, second, the implications for the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Abel, A.B.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.35,0)">, “Will Bequests Attenuate the Predicted Meltdown in Stock Prices When Baby Boomers Retire?”, Review of Economics and Statistics 83, pp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.96,0)">589-595.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Abel, A.B.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">, “The Effects of a Baby Boom on Stock Prices and Capital Accumulation in the Presence of Social Security”, Econometrica 71, pp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.57,0)">551-578.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Auerbach, A.J., L.J.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Kotlikoff, R.P.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.57,0)">Hagemann and G.

Summers   estimated that a 0.15% yearly increase in the rate of growth of productivity is needed to avoid a decline in living standards in the United States as a result of increasing dependency ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.06,0)">Bean  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Brumberg and Modigliani  .</span><span style="background-color:

the savings ratio of about 6.1 percentage points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.44,0)">A number of studies have looked into household data   to test whether individual saving behaviour is consistent with the life-cycle theory, and it is generally found that the savings rate of retirees does not fall as much as the life-cycle theory predicts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.74,0)">However, Miles   clarifies that “the mistake here is to count all of pension receipts as income” as opposed to sales of their pension “rights”.</span><span

style="background-color: rgb(255,11.34,0)">At the opposite end of the age structure, the European Commission   estimates that the ratio of education expenditure over GDP in the euro area is likely to decline by around 0.6-0.7% over the next 50 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.04,0)">The OECD   estimates that, between 2005 and 2050, ageing in the euro area could increase public pension costs by 3% of GDP, public healthcare costs by 3.7%, and long-term care costs by 2.2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Börsch-Supan, Ludwig and Winter

interest rate in the European Union, while internal results by Kara and von Thadden   find a slightly steeper fall of around 90 basis points in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The hump-shaped macroeconomic response to post-Second World War demographic events was already anticipated by Auerbach, Kotlikoff, Hagemann and Nicoletti  .</span><span

.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Medeiros   finds that ageing represents an opportunity for future generations to invest in education, since a shrinking labour force contributes to higher capital intensity ratios and thereby higher labour earnings, which boost the returns to human capital investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">De La Croix, Lindh and Malmberg   point out that longer life expectancy raises the expected return from human capital investments and thus creates incentives to accumulate more education and training   An exception is Becker, Murphy and Tamura  , who built a model that endogenises the human capital investment decision and also its link to fertility decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In their model, if the stock of physical capital is relatively large, the returns to education would become relatively attractive   and the cost of raising children would increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.75,0)">Chinn and Frankel   found that US and European long-term real interest rates on government debt depended significantly upon current and expected levels of debt over the period 1973-2003.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Laubach   estimates that a 1% increase in the expected US debt-to-GDP ratio led to an average rise in US long-term rates of 5.3 basis points over the period 1985-2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.23,0)">A different result is reported by Barro and Sala-i-Martin  , who analyse short-term real interest rates in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States over the period 1959-1988, finding that fiscal variables are not significant either for the expected real interest rate or for the domestic investment/saving ratio.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Canton et al  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.39,0)">Holzmann   points out that, if the flow of immigrants does not accelerate, the combined total labour force in Europe, Russia, the high-income countries of East Asia and the Pacific, China, and North America may decline by around 5 million by 2025 and by 181 million by 2050.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In order to keep the labour force constant in the EU25, around 1.5 million immigrants could be needed annually from 2005 to 2050   De Serres et al  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Lane and Milesi-Feretti  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Batini, Callen and McKibbin   find mild responses of the current account to demographic factors when they assume that developing countries cannot quickly absorb large amounts of foreign investment from developed economies: in Europe, ageing could contribute up to half a percentage point improvement in the current-account-over-GDP ratio from 2005 to 2025, but this effect turns slightly negative after 2030  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Börsch-Supan, Krueger and Ludwig   simulate an open-economy model with free capital flows among OECD countries but no flows to non-OECD countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.41,0)">They find that ageing will lead to a relative abundance of capital, with the real rate of return in the OECD countries falling by around 80-90 basis points between 2005 and 2050, and relatively modest capital flows from/to the European Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Economic theory suggests that capital should be flowing from developed economies, characterized by relatively older populations, higher capital endowments and fewer investment opportunities, to emerging market economies, where the population is younger, capital scarcer and investment opportunities relatively more abundant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Empirical evidence suggests that capital is not exactly moving in the expected direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This could be attributed to a savings glut mainly originating in Asia, where demographic and institutional factors could also play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.17,0)">In a panel covering a large number of countries from 1970 to 2003, De Santis and Lührmann   for example find that an increase in old-age dependency ratios has been correlated with capital inflows, challenging the view that ageing may contribute to current-account surpluses in developed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Young  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.52,0)">Bean   argues that longer life expectancy would presumably reinforce this effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Poterba   suggests that families whose head is over 65 years old will hold almost half of all corporate stock and 64% of all annuity contracts in the United States in 2040, up from 33% and 50% respectively in 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">G10  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Miles   points out that the monetary policy multiplier would probably rise with population ageing, mainly as a result of the increased wealth channel and greater price impact of monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">However, he also mentions that an older population is less likely to be credit-constrained, especially when the pension system is reformed towards more funded systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.2,0)">This might reduce the effectiveness of the credit channel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.38,0)">Depending on the relative importance of these channels, monetary policy could, in principle, become more or less effective with ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Miles suggests that the first effect is expected to dominate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Bakshi and Chen   and De Santis and Lührmann  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">G10   and Bean  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">It is likely that, as a significant fraction of wealth is accumulated in real estate and financial assets, households’ exposure to asset price movements will tend to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.89,0)">This might coincide with a situation in which a large fraction of the population – in their old-age dissaving phase – are selling assets in order to finance consumption during retirement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.19,0)">In this respect, some authors have warned that, when the baby-boom generation retires and starts to dissave, excess supply in financial markets could contribute to a significant decline in asset prices, the consequences of which might be felt by the entire population  , Abel   and  , Börsch-Supan and Winter  , and Bean
