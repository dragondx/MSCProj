    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)"> Hearing at the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory statement by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, Brussels, 30 June 2011 Dear Madam Chair, Dear Honourable Members, It is a pleasure to be back in Parliament and your Committee for our regular exchange of views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Once again, our meeting comes at a time when important decisions are being taken but also pending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.99,0)">Of particular concern is the conclusion of the legislative procedure on the economic governance package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Je tiens tout d’abord à saluer les efforts continus du Parlement européen et du Conseil afin de rapprocher leurs positions sur le paquet de gouvernance économique.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Le Conseil des Gouverneurs aurait souhaité que le Conseil européen du 24 Juin dernier fasse un geste d’ouverture envers le Parlement européen sur ce dossier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Le principal point de désaccord – l’extension de la majorité qualifiée inversée dans le volet préventif du pacte de stabilité et de croissance – est d'une importance clé.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">La zone euro a urgemment besoin d'un cadre de gouvernance économique renforcé et ambitieux.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">La crise actuelle démontre, de manière irréfutable, s’il en était encore besoin, les conséquences néfastes de politiques budgétaires et économiques malsaines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Deshalb ist es unerlässlich, zu einer ambitionierten Einigung zu kommen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In der aktuellen Lage wäre eine Einigung besonders begrüßenswert, um deutlich zu machen, dass die richtigen Lektionen aus der Krise gezogen werden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me now turn to the economic and monetary developments in the euro area since our previous meeting in March, as well as the two topics you have asked me to focus on, namely fiscal consolidation and monetary policy on the one hand, and sovereign debt developments on the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Economic and Monetary Developments Let me first turn to the economic and monetary developments in the euro area since our previous meeting in March.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.04,0)">In this context, let me also note that we are now in the purdah period, as the next Governing Council meeting will take place on 7 July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.47,0)">This means that nothing in what I will say is intended or should be interpreted in any respect in terms of future monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Incoming information since I last spoke to you has confirmed a positive underlying momentum of economic activity in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">We expect the continued expansion of the world economy and domestic demand from the private sector as the main driver of economic growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The latest Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections are in line with this assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">They foresee the economy to grow between 1.5% and 2.3% for 2011 and between 0.6% and 2.8% for 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In our view, the risks to this outlook remain broadly balanced in a context of elevated uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.45,0)">As regards price developments, we are observing continued upward pressure on prices, especially in the earlier stages of the production process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.55,0)">Inflation in the euro area stood at 2.7% in May, after 2.8% in April.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.74,0)">The inflation rates seen over the past few months largely reflect higher energy and commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Going forward, inflation is likely to stay clearly above 2% over the months ahead, mainly due to energy and commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.23,0)">The Eurosystem staff projections indicate inflation ranging between 2.5% and 2.7% for 2011, and between 1.1 and 2.3% for 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It is of paramount importance that the current relatively high inflation rates do not translate into second-round effects, via higher wages and price-setting, and thereby do not lead to broad-based inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.19,0)">Risks to the medium-term outlook for price developments continue to be on the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Notably, energy prices could increase faster than currently expected, and indirect taxes and administered prices might be raised faster with a view to reducing budget deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">In addition, increasing capacity utilisation may exert stronger upward pressure on domestic prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">As regards our monetary analysis, we see the underlying pace of monetary expansion gradually recovering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">At the same time, monetary liquidity remains ample.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This has the potential to accommodate price pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">As you are aware, we are strongly determined to secure that inflation expectations remain firmly in line with our aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Against this background the Governing Council raised the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points in April, in order to adjust the very accommodative monetary policy stance in the light of upside risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Since then we have kept the rates unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">At the same time, as I said in the press conference after the last Governing Council, we see the monetary policy stance as still accommodative and risks to price stability on the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Accordingly, I said that we are in a state of strong vigilance and that we stand ready to act in a firm and timely manner to avoid that recent price developments give rise to broad-based inflationary pressures over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">As regards our non-standard measures, the Governing Council earlier this month decided to maintain its fixed rate tender procedures with full allotment in its refinancing operations up to the third quarter of 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">II Fiscal consolidation and monetary policy Let me now turn to the topic of fiscal consolidation and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.4,0)">In a monetary union, the central bank when setting interest rates has to take an area-wide perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.54,0)">In the same manner the US Federal Reserve do not and cannot tailor its interest rate to the specific economic conditions in individual US states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Setting the policy rate with a clear focus on the euro area as a whole does not, however, mean ignoring the diversity in financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">Since the financial crisis erupted, the ECB has adopted a number of non-standard measures to foster as much as possible a smooth functioning of the monetary policy transmission throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.81,0)">The current major challenges faced by a few euro area countries are mainly the result of some governments not conducting sound policies and not implementing reforms that would benefit their citizens and the European public as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It is essential that euro area countries fully assume the responsibilities at the national level that derive from their participation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Past experiences of fiscal consolidation episodes demonstrate the long-term benefits of reducing sizeable fiscal imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">There are at least three reasons why well-designed fiscal consolidation is beneficial in the current circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Accompanied by appropriate structural reforms, it promotes long-term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">For those economies with large fiscal imbalances, it is indispensable to bolster confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">And for all economies it helps create buffers that would be essential to deal with unforeseen events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">It is also for this reason that the ongoing negotiations on the governance package should produce an ambitious outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">I have been emphasising time and again why we are very much in agreement with the European Parliament on this – the need for a quantum leap in economic governance through the currently discussed legislative package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">At this stage, I would like to recall two points: First, we should not be content with a stronger Stability and Growth Pact only at the later stages of an excessive deficit procedure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.74,0)">We need to halt any fiscal excesses early on and correct them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The obvious way is a higher degree of automaticity early on in the procedures, that is, more reverse qualified majority voting in the preventive arm of the Pact; and therefore the prospect of more timely sanctions, possibly of a reputational nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Second, we would benefit considerably from an equally ambitious macroeconomic imbalances framework that detects imbalances early on, through a well focused and rigorously applied scoreboard; and then corrects them, again in a timely fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.29,0)">Here, we need to focus on those countries that ultimately pose a risk to other euro area countries through in particular persistent and excessive competitiveness losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">Sovereign debt developments Let me now turn to the current sovereign debt developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.45,0)">As you know, at the euro area level, we see that fiscal consolidation in many countries is ongoing, and will, according to the European Commission’s Spring 2011 Forecast, bring the euro area general government deficit down to 3.5% by 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">This is an encouraging prospect, especially by international comparison.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.56,0)">Also for the current year the euro area fiscal deficit is somewhat less than half of that of the US and Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.95,0)">However, selected euro area countries are currently still facing high debt and deficit levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The ECB has always made clear that the best way to cope with the current sovereign debt positions is a determined and disciplined implementation of agreed fiscal consolidation paths and the structural reform agenda to promote medium term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">For the euro area countries under an EU/IMF programme, a determined implementation of those programmes is of utmost importance to get back to a sound economic situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">This call has been echoed by the European Council, which at its recent meeting urged the national authorities, especially but not only in Greece, to continue implementing rigorously and with the highest resolve the necessary adjustment efforts to put the country on a sustainable path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">To that end, national unity and cross-party consensus are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.01,0)">As to the possibility of debt action, let me recall what I have said many times on this matter, on behalf of the Governing Council: We strongly advise against all concepts that are not purely voluntary or that have elements of compulsion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We call for the avoidance of any credit events and selection default or default.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me add that I am from time to time surprised by the narrow view of private sector involvement that is generally taken in the present debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">We should not forget that private capital is also mobilised when embarking on privatisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Privatisation is a good way of mobilising private capital and is something that we have encouraged considerably, particularly in the case of Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">It is an effective way of mobilising private capital and has positive consequences not only on the financing of the country, but also in terms of positive structural effects on growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Finally, the private sector involvement that everybody is aiming at is to go back as soon as possible to private sector market financing.</span>
