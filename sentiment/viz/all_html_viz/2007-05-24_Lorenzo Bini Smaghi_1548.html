    <span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)"> With or Without Prejudice to Price Stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB at the Barclays Capital Annual ConferenceLondon, 24 May 2007 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, It is an honour and a great pleasure for me to address you this evening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I would like to take this opportunity to discuss one of the issues that has puzzled me and, at times, concerned me the most during my two years on the ECB’s Executive Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.92,0)">It is the issue of the so-called “secondary objective” of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">As you well know, the Treaty establishing the European Community states that, “ without prejudice” to the overriding objective of price stability, the ECB shall support the general objectives of the Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">These objectives are spelled out in Article 2 of the Treaty, namely: “… a harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activities, a high level of employment and of social protection, … sustainable and non-inflationary growth, … and economic and social cohesion …”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And these objectives are all put at the same level, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.31,0)">there is no specific hierarchy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">However, when it comes to the part concerning monetary policy and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks, the Treaty clearly states that the primary objective of monetary policy is price stability, and that the other objectives, such as sustainable growth and employment, should only be supported “without prejudice” to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This wording used in the Treaty seems to imply that there are two different ways through which monetary policy can support sustainable growth and employment: one that is without prejudice to price stability and the other that, instead, may constitute a prejudice to the primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This therefore raises the question: what contribution can monetary policy make to the harmonious, balanced and sustainable development of economic activities that does not prejudice price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.98,0)">This is not a new question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Even before I came to the ECB, at my hearing before the European Parliament, I was asked: “ Without prejudice to the objective of price stability, how in your view should the ECB fulfil its secondary obligation under the Treaty   and what instruments could the ECB use to do so?”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Interestingly the same question has been put to all past and subsequent candidates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Perhaps one day somebody will finally give the “right” answer!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.94,0)">But, joking aside, why is this issue so puzzling?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Well, maybe it is because the answers provided by central bankers and most academics expert in monetary and financial economics are quite different from those of commentators and politicians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.33,0)">Bankers and economists, for example, would say that the best contribution that monetary policy can make to sustainable growth is to promote price stability; whereas certain politicians and commentators argue at times that central banks, including the ECB tend to focus too heavily on inflation, to the neglect of growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.56,0)">How can we rationalise and explain the reasons for such different views?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">How can we hope to lay the ground for a common understanding?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Personally I am tempted to adopt a quite provocative line of reasoning and ask: well, what would happen if we set, as the primary objective of monetary policy, the achievement of “harmonious, balanced and sustainable growth” rather than price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Would monetary policy be substantially different from the one of a central bank pursuing price stability as its primary objective, as is the case of the ECB?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Would it all make a difference?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The answer depends on the underlying model of the economy that one has in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.79,0)">I will contend that those who think that monetary policy has a choice between output stability and price stability base their view on a very specific assumption about the way the economy functions, and in particular about how agents form their expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Once these assumptions are relaxed, and a more realistic view of the world is adopted, it can be demonstrated that monetary policy has no choice, if it wants to support growth, but to consistently promote price stability over the medium term in a credible fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I would like to structure my remarks as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I will start from a simple mainstream New Keynesian model of the economy, and then consider more complicated, but more realistic, models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Based on this analysis, I will then explain what the general consensus is among central bankers virtually worldwide, independently of what their central bank statutes formally state, and provide some relevant empirical evidence on the issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Finally, I would like to discuss briefly some of the risks involved in an environment of price stability, mainly in terms of the complacency of both policy-makers and market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And then I will conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.29,0)">The simple theoretical model Let me start from a simple theoretical model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.25,0)">In the standard New Keynesian framework, with rational expectations and full information by the central bank, the existence of a trade-off between output stability and price stability depends on the nature of the shocks hitting the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Demand shocks do not pose any dilemma for monetary policy, since the interest rate reaction aimed at stabilising inflation is consistent with that aimed at stabilising output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.43,0)">By contrast, cost push shocks   are a dilemma for monetary policy, since the interest rate reaction to stabilise inflation is of an opposite direction to that required to stabilise output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.2,0)">For these shocks, the central bank must make a choice between stabilising inflation or output, or a combination of both.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.75,0)">In this analytical framework, the way in which the central bank reacts to a cost push shock entails a choice between two competing objectives: the stabilisation of inflation variability or the stabilisation of output variability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.75,0)">Indeed, a central bank aiming primarily at stabilising output would have to compromise on inflation stability and vice versa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It would thus make a difference, in terms of price stability or output stability, whether the central bank had as its primary objective the former or the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This explains the interest of observers, market participants and politicians in trying to understand and, in some cases, also to influence, central bank preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The key assumptions of this model is that the central bank has full knowledge of the structure of the economy and of the shocks affecting it and that agents are fully rational and know perfectly the objectives and preferences of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In this full-information and fully-rational context, there is a well-defined and stable trade-off between output and inflation variability  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The central bank has to choose a point along an efficiency frontier and ensure that its behaviour is consistent with, and therefore validates agents’ expectations in a repeated game context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Based on this analytical framework, the literature has developed normative prescriptions on the optimal behaviour of the central bank, which can be described according to an optimal policy rule, conditional on the structure of the economy and the shocks hitting it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">This type of model is certainly useful, largely because of its simplicity and thus its ability to derive simple policy rules for the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.9,0)">However, the gap between model and reality may be a bit too wide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me emphasise one key assumption that underpins the model, which might be   unrealistic: in these models, central banks are considered as some sort of gods, in which all economic agents fully believe, just like religious fanatics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In such a world, the issue of central bank credibility does not arise, by definition, because the central bank has full knowledge of the economy and always behaves optimally, hitting whatever target it is given.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.98,0)">There is only one Phillips curve, along which different equilibria are determined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The central bank has just to decide the point along the curve that it decides to target and then achieve it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.04,0)">However, although being likened to gods may be flattering for central banks, it is unfortunately somewhat exaggerated and removed from reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.33,0)">Economic agents, especially market participants, certainly do not believe unconditionally in central banks and tend to behave rather like St Thomas: see first, then believe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.74,0)">Thus, central bank credibility cannot be taken for granted: it is continuously tested, and rightly so, by the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.93,0)">This suggests that some of the assumptions underlying the theoretical models used to analyse monetary policy might be too simplistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">More realistic models Substantial research has been carried out in recent years to model inflation expectations in a more realistic way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.5,0)">Models of learning, imperfect knowledge and bounded rationality are becoming increasingly widespread in monetary economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.99,0)">In short, these models are based on a “signal extraction” problem, whereby economic agents learn, albeit slowly and in an imperfect manner, the underlying   central bank preferences, including the inflation target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.27,0)">They do this by observing the behaviour of the target over time, when there is one, and by looking at the resulting inflation performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.66,0)">And inflation expectations tend to be particularly sensitive to sustained deviations between observed inflation and its   target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.75,0)">In such models, when the economy is hit by a shock that temporarily increases inflation, agents consider that the objective of the central bank might have changed, and possibly increased above previous expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.87,0)">Divergences between inflation expectations and the inflation target affect the persistency of inflationary pressures following an exogenous shock, thereby making it more costly   for the central bank to bring inflation back to the target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.97,0)">In these models, there is no single trade-off between output and inflation variability, but a multiplicity of trade-offs, depending on the way inflation expectations are formed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.23,0)">If inflation expectations rise, for whatever reason, the efficiency frontier between output and inflation stabilisation is shifted outwards, raising both output and inflation variability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.29,0)">The higher the level of inflation expectations is, the higher the level of output variability is for any given level of inflation, and vice versa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">That is why it is so important for inflation expectations to remain as close as possible to the target, especially after an exogenous shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">It is a way to keep the inflation-output trade-off as favourable as possible and thus minimise both output and inflation variability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In more sophisticated models, the anchoring of inflationary expectations to their target is essential, not only in the face of cost push shocks, as previously examined, but also in the face of demand shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.55,0)">Given that there are lags between the impact of demand shocks on output and the impact on prices – the former generally being quicker than the latter – the dynamics of inflation might differ substantially from those of output growth, especially at turning points in the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.91,0)">This poses a challenge to monetary policy in the presence of less-than-perfect foresight/rational expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.98,0)">For instance, as the economy reaches a cyclical peak, the slowdown in economic activity would normally tend to precede the adjustment in price dynamics, as inflationary pressures might continue for some time, especially in the presence of labour and product market rigidities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In the ideal world of perfect anchoring of inflation expectations and full central bank credibility that I considered initially, there would be no problem for monetary policy: inflation expectations are always aligned to the target, and observed inflation adjusts rapidly to the cyclical conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Under such circumstances, monetary policy can follow quite closely the cyclical pattern in output and easing takes place as soon as the economy slows down, thus supporting economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There is no contradiction between the two objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.25,0)">If, instead, inflationary expectations are not fully aligned with the target, the central bank may well face a dilemma.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.84,0)">As the economy slows down, the central bank might decide to reduce interest rates, ignoring inflationary pressures and expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.15,0)">However, this might create the suspicion by economic agents that the central bank has changed its inflation target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.16,0)">The divergence between inflation expectations and the target might further increase, adding to inflation persistence and volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.64,0)">To bring inflation down, the central bank will ultimately have to maintain a tight stance for a longer period of time, despite the economic slowdown, and this will add to output volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.41,0)">If inflation expectations are allowed to be disanchored, monetary policy will turn out to be much more restrictive than would be the case with anchored expectations; inflation volatility will come at the price of greater output volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The more inflation expectations are aligned with the target, the quicker monetary policy can be adjusted to the underlying economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This is why central banks communicate publicly that their primary focus is price stability, even as the economy slows down, so that they can anchor expectations and therefore align as quickly as possible their interest rate policy with the underlying macroeconomic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To sum up, in a world in which credibility is not taken for granted, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.32,0)">central banks are not infallible, the trade-off between price stability and output stability is greatly diminished, both under cost and demand shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">For monetary policy to support growth, it has to ensure price stability in a credible way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Central banks’ views Central banks in the industrial world follow an approach that derives from the more realistic models I have just described.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">They do not consider themselves to be infallible, but rather see their ability to anchor expectations as a key asset; one that takes a long time to build up, but also one that can be lost very quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Under such conditions, maintaining price stability is necessary to foster sustainable development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me give you three recent quotes by three different Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">I leave it up to you to guess where they come from  : “By keeping inflation on track to meet the 2% target in the medium term, thus ensuring price stability, the Bank is providing a platform of macroeconomic stability which is the best contribution monetary policy can make to the objectives of high and stable levels of economic growth and employment.”   “Experience shows that low and stable inflation and inflation expectations are also associated with greater short-term stability in output and employment, perhaps in part because they give the central bank greater latitude to counter transitory disturbances to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In sum, achieving price stability is not only important in itself; it is also central to attaining the other mandated objectives of maximum sustainable employment and moderate long-term interest rates.”   “Price stability is an indispensable prerequisite for realizing sustainable growth, and the Bank is responsible for realizing price stability through an appropriate conduct of monetary policy.”   What is interesting about these three quotes is that they reflect a common view, independently of the institutional framework in which the three Central Banks operate and also of the underlying stage of the cycle in the various countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">This was also reflected in the most recent G7 communiqué of 13 April 2007, which stated that: “ We   continue to be committed to maintaining price stability as the best contribution that monetary policy can make to sustained global growth”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">So there is a striking degree of consensus in policy-making circles that price stability and output stability are two sides of the same coin, and that there is no exploitable trade-off between these two objectives, at least not over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">The evidence There is a substantial amount of evidence confirming the result derived from the more realistic models, which indicates that the more inflation expectations are anchored, the more monetary policy can be supportive of economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.39,0)">Economic history has shown that inflation was more persistent during the period of Great Inflation in the 1970s and much less persistent during the period of stable prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.43,0)">According to some studies, inflation appears to have been less persistent in Germany   than in other industrial countries, although there is some debate surrounding this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Moreover, although there are many explanations of the Great Moderation, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.92,0)">the radical reduction in output growth volatility experienced in the last two decades,   it is generally accepted that the Great Disinflation was accompanied by a marked decline of output volatility, not only in the United States, but also on a global scale  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">There is, on the other hand, no evidence that lower real GDP growth volatility has been obtained at the expense of somewhat higher inflation volatility; in fact, if anything, the opposite seems to be true, also if we look across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">In addition, there is significant empirical support for the proposition that inflation negatively affects long-term growth, even at relatively low levels of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.46,0)">Finally, there is also some evidence that banking crises are more frequent in countries with high and variable inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.47,0)">Furthermore, we might have to reconsider the view that the high macroeconomic stability in the United States in the period following the mid-1980s might be attributed to increased monetary policy activism, known as “the resurrection of fine-tuning”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There is recent evidence that the so-called period of Great Moderation is a global phenomenon which occurred at the same time as the Great Disinflation and the beginning of the period of stable prices, although there is not necessarily a direct causal link between the two.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.18,0)">The reduction in output growth volatility after the mid-eighties   was, in fact, not limited to the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Moreover, the evidence that output growth volatility actually picked up at the onset of the Great Inflation reinforces this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.03,0)">Long and short-term interest rates the world over have also become significantly less variable and lower in real terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The evidence would seem to confirm that it is the focus on price stability and the anchoring of inflation expectations which have contributed to reducing output volatility, rather than increased activism on the part of the Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.96,0)">In any case, recent research shows that differences in the institutional structure, the mandate or even the environment do not lead central banks to behave differently in their attempts to combat inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">A recent study, for instance, compared the behaviour of the ECB and the Federal Reserve against the background of a similar structural model, estimated respectively on euro area and US data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The results show that, had the ECB followed the same estimated monetary policy rule as the Fed and applied it to the euro area economy, its contribution to economic growth in the period 2001-06 would not have been greater; actually the opposite holds true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.19,0)">Another paper, using a different estimated model for the euro area and the United States, found that differences in the type, size and persistence of shocks explain the different interest rates between the two areas, rather than differences in the monetary policy reaction function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This would suggest that comparisons between different interest rate levels at different times in different countries do not necessarily lead to concluding that a central bank assigns a greater weight to supporting economic activity than another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.15,0)">Looking at the most recent period, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that short-term interest rates in the euro area are currently significantly lower than in the United States, by over 100 basis points, despite GDP growth being stronger on this side of the Atlantic, for over a year now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.36,0)">This might be partly linked to the fact that inflation expectations have been systematically lower and more stable in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The same holds true in a comparison with the United Kingdom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">We need to understand why inflation expectations have remained relatively low and stable in the euro area, and market participants are among the best placed to answer this question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">I would contend that the reason is that the ECB has acquired over the years substantial credibility as an inflation fighter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.06,0)">This is the main reason why interest rates are relatively low in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">This confirms that promoting price stability is fully consistent with, and actually the best way to promote, sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">To sum up, evidence suggests that central banks aim to stabilise output growth primarily by stabilising prices and anchoring inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">This is consistent with the models examined previously, which show that achieving price stability is instrumental in sustaining economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.92,0)">Anchoring inflation expectations In the introduction I provocatively asked the question of whether monetary policy would differ if growth, rather than price stability, were the primary objective of a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.83,0)">The arguments presented so far would suggest a negative answer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.52,0)">Since price stability is a way to achieve the ultimate objective of stable and sustainable growth, why do central bank statutes mention price stability as their main goal, rather than growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.79,0)">Well, there are several reasons – one is accountability: growth depends on many things, price stability being one of them, and monetary policy should be held accountable only for what it can deliver over a certain period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Consider the following: the ultimate objective of a good diet is to be healthier and to live longer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">However, any diet sets clear and unambiguous goals, in terms of a number of kilos or pounds that can be easily monitored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Another reason is very much linked to the features of the economic model previously described, and the importance of anchoring agents’ expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.87,0)">We know very little about how inflation expectations are formed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.53,0)">Expectation phenomena are likely to be abrupt and non-linear, as studied for example in the finance literature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.15,0)">They may be triggered by apparently irrelevant events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.7,0)">Moreover, once expectations go off mark, it may be hard to bring them back under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.03,0)">Nor can we assume that inflation expectations of households and firms are the same as those of financial market participants, which sometimes receive more attention.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">It has been shown in the literature that, in the presence of learning and bounded rationality, the optimal weight of inflation in the reaction function of the central bank must be higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This is one of the reasons why it is important to have a clear quantitative definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In this context, an institutional framework safeguarding central bank independence and a clear indication of a quantitative definition of price stability, to which the monetary authority may be held accountable, are very helpful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.55,0)">Ultimately, however, there is no substitute for a track record of being able and determined to maintain price stability; in fact, there is evidence that long-term inflation expectations have traditionally been lagging, rather than leading, indicators of actual inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">All in all, if fostering sustainable growth is what matters, it pays off for society as a whole to have central bankers who are a bit obsessed about inflation!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The risks I am nearing the end of my address, but I would just like to mention very briefly one risk that may arise in an environment of apparently solidly entrenched price stability, which is what we currently witness in most industrial and also developing countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.55,0)">The risk I am referring to is complacency: complacency by both the central banks and the private sector, primarily market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">For monetary authorities the risk is to forget that keeping well-anchored inflation expectations and low inflation persistence requires, above all, a forward-looking and decisive reaction to inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.5,0)">The central bank may occasionally have a hard time in convincing market participants and public opinion that monetary policy action is required, at times, to keep inflationary pressure under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.44,0)">For market participants, the risk is that inflation expectations, for example those embedded in bond yields, progressively lose information and are not adequate to price, and protect against, possible risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.44,0)">The absence of an adequate assessment of, and possibly insurance against, sudden shifts in inflation expectations could in turn aggravate the actual turmoil created by these phenomena, which are notoriously unpredictable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Thus, central banks have to move along a fine line between being credible and avoiding instilling too much complacency in market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">From a longer-term perspective, we should not forget that the remarkable macroeconomic stability that we have witnessed in the past two decades has been rather exceptional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.25,0)">History is replete with periods of apparently unshakeable stability and prosperity being suddenly broken by instability and depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">For example, and with due regard to the different proportions, the instability following the First World War was preceded by a period of stability and progress during the belle époque which at the time seemed almost “natural” and ever lasting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.07,0)">The same can be said for the two decades after the Second World War, which were followed by 15 years of economic and financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">We have learnt from these episodes to develop institutions, most notably independent central banks, with the task of safeguarding price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">These institutions can, however, adequately perform their functions in the long run if they have the continuous support and attention by market participants and the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.58,0)">We also know that circumstances can become more adverse than they have been over the recent past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.48,0)">To sum up, the risk is that we all forget that inflation, even when dormant, is itself always a risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Even at the cost of sounding boring – and this is ultimately our goal - it is the task of central banks to remind society of this risk, and to act to counteract such a risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.57,0)">This creates a catch 22.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Central banks must mention and explain the inflationary risks underlying the economy that might justify their policy actions, but they must also reassure markets and agents that their actions will counteract such risks so that, ultimately, price stability is ensured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.08,0)">The two messages are not necessarily easy to get through.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.71,0)">A typical example of this difficulty is the question that is often put to central banks: why are you talking about inflation risks if inflation is low?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Why are you raising rates, if there is price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.18,0)">The answer, which is not always fully understood, is that inflation is low because central banks act to ensure price stability, and they act based on their projection of underlying inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As history and analysis have shown, preventing central banks from playing such a role, of warning and acting to prevent inflation, does not produce more growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.21,0)">The main risk of central banks is to become themselves victim of the so-called Goodhart law, which says that if you target successfully a variable with a given instrument, the observed statistical correlation between that instrument and the targeted variable tends to vanish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.01,0)">If the central bank’s interest rate policy is successful in ensuring price stability, there will be over time little or no observable correlation between interest rates and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.28,0)">This certainly makes central banks' task of explaining their policy a bit challenging, and certainly not boring!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Conclusions To conclude, let me just reiterate what I would call a “central bank consensus”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">A strong focus on price stability is the best contribution monetary policy can make towards sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Being focused on inflation over the medium term, rather than on a combination of inflation and output stability, helps to anchor inflation expectations and keep inflation persistence low and thus to foster output growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Therefore, a central bank focused on price stability does exactly what a central bank aimed at promoting sustainable growth would do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">I know that this consensus is widely shared by a large part of the academic world and certainly by financial market participants, who are those that ultimately assess the credibility of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.44,0)">However, we have to recognise that this consensus is not yet fully shared by all, and still questioned in particular by some observers, commentators, politicians, sometimes social partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.75,0)">Why is it the case?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.36,0)">The answer that I tried to give is that many of these outside observers are influenced by economic models that are based on very restrictive assumptions, which might not be entirely realistic, especially concerning the way in which interest rates are determined in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">One of these assumptions is that central banks have full knowledge of the economy and are not only infallible but also believed by market participants to be infallible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.8,0)">This raises a series of paradoxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.49,0)">The first is that these models, and their underlying hypothesis of infallible central banks, are often used in the intention to put into doubt central banks infallibility and to criticize them for being stubborn inflation fighters, instead of growth promoters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.02,0)">A second paradox is that if central banks followed what these critics suggest, and aimed at the wrong target, for sure market participants will start doubting their infallibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.96,0)">If this happens, the central bank would be incapable of exploiting any trade-off and would end with higher inflation and higher output variability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.26,0)">The third paradox is that when central banks’ credibility is put into question, maybe because of the criticisms of those that would want a more expansionary policy, the only way for central banks to regain credibility, in order to support growth, is to focus even more on fighting inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">That is why central banks’ statutes mention price stability above all other objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And that is why central bankers are paid not only to worry about inflation risks, but also to make sure that these risks do not materialise, in particular by acting in a “firm and timely” fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span>
