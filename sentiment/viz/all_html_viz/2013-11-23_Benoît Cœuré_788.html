    <h1> The political dimension of European economic integration </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, At the 19th Université d'automne de la Ligue des droits de l'Homme, Paris, 23 November 2013 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)"> The political dimension of European economic integration Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, At the 19th Université d’automne de la Ligue des droits de l’Homme, Paris, 23 November 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen  , Before I start, let me thank the Ligue des droits de l’Homme for inviting me to speak today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">As we approach the 100th anniversary of the First World War, it is worth remembering that the European project emerged from a moral imperative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Following two tragic episodes of self-destruction and the abandonment of the most fundamental humanistic values, Europeans acknowledged that, in the words of Robert Schuman 50 years ago: “Serving mankind is a duty demanded of us equal to that of national loyalty”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Europe thus became our common political project, a project of peace, democracy, freedom and economic reconstruction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">And in fact the European Union has succeeded on each of these accounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The people of Europe have also expected European integration to promote convergence towards high standards of living and social protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">An enlarged European Union has welcomed poorer countries which fully belong to the European project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.34,0)">The resulting dispersion in income levels has been a first challenge to the convergence process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.68,0)">The crisis has then reversed this process across Europe, with states having to launch debt reduction programmes accompanied by structural reforms, and rising unemployment bringing widespread social hardship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.94,0)">Faced with the costs of this adjustment, many people are tempted to turn their backs on Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">And the more they do so, the further we are from a solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.68,0)">It is, I think, acknowledged that the crisis had its roots in a flawed vision of European integration that should now be corrected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">But this reconstruction work will only be legitimate if it creates the conditions for growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">So I want to consider three issues today: First, I’d like to make a case for the EU and the euro’s achievements, which are too often overlooked in the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">Second, I’ll explain how policies at European and national levels can help to restore growth and reduce unemployment, with a focus on what the European Central Bank   can – and cannot – achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Finally, explore ways to strengthen the political legitimacy of our Economic and Monetary Union   and revive the political dimension of the European project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">The benefits of European integration European integration has been our quest to achieve a common civilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.9,0)">Today, we frequently forget how much it has contributed to the reconstruction of Europe – morally, politically and economically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.42,0)">In what ways?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">European integration means peace in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Not only did it end the long-standing Franco-German confrontation, it also reunified the continent after the Cold War – a point which resonates even more strongly for people of my generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.24,0)">There is however a creeping temptation to take this achievement for granted and to underestimate the risks posed by nationalist tendencies being stirred up by the crisis in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">European integration has contributed to the spread of democracy, freedom and the rule of law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">For the founding countries, the European project was a unique chance to anchor democracy on this side of the Iron Curtain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The enlargement of the European Union has helped to strengthen democratic principles in countries that suffered years of dictatorship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">European integration supported post-war economic reconstruction in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.2,0)">For Europe’s founding fathers, making war impossible meant making Europe resistant to another Great Depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">This was obtained by way of a “ de facto solidarity”   based on the pooling of coal and steel production, and the gradual creation of a single market, and subsequently complemented by cohesion policies and the creation of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Let me also say a few words on the benefits of our common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">The euro is the most visible and most internationally known symbol of a united Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Surveys show it has become the first element of the European identity: when asked to identify the most important elements that make up that European identity, 50% of respondents in the euro area first mention the common currency, just ahead of democratic values  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Moreover, the euro is the world’s second reserve currency after the US dollar: in 2012, around 24% of declared foreign reserves were held in euros.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">With the euro, we enjoy the benefits of price stability, which preserves the value of incomes and savings, especially for the most fragile in society, who hold their savings as cash or bank deposits and can’t protect themselves against inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Since the creation of the euro, inflation has risen on average almost exactly 2% per year in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">By comparison, inflation from 1961 to 1991   averaged over 10% in Portugal, Greece and Spain, but also 6.6% in France and 3.4% in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">The euro reduces transaction costs for producers, their employees and end clients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">It facilitates price comparisons and bank transfers, while eliminating currency risks in intra-euro area trade and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Finally, and above all, the interdependence and shared responsibility implied by the euro create a European solidarity imperative in the face of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">This “ de facto solidarity” is the greatest challenge that the European Union faces today, against the background of a greater disparity across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">If I may turn Schuman’s formula on its head, it now calls for “concrete achievements”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.56,0)">The temptation to go it alone in economic affairs, so evident in the past   is no longer appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This does not preclude countries from having different views or different interests, but it creates a duty to overcome these differences and act together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.77,0)">Reducing unemployment The current crisis, with its associated fall in incomes and rise in unemployment, has however bred misunderstanding and sometimes anger in many parts of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.96,0)">Unemployment in the euro area stood at 12.2% in September 2013, compared with 7.6% at the beginning of the financial crisis in the second quarter of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.01,0)">Young people have been hit especially hard: more than 3.5 million persons under 25 are now without a job in the euro area – that’s almost one in four.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.79,0)">In Greece and Spain the youth unemployment rate is over 50%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.4,0)">Absent a strong push for growth, there is a tangible risk to create a “lost generation”, as Europe has done in a more tragic way in 1914-1918.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.79,0)">This situation is undermining trust in national and EU institutions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.14,0)">And it is worrying because we cannot resolve this problem by resorting to the nationalist solutions of the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Only a joint effort can reduce unemployment in a sustainable manner, using both national and European instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Our first objective must be to reduce financial fragmentation in the euro area, which is illustrated by the different borrowing conditions in the various euro area countries and which has contributed – among other factors – to a divergence of investment and unemployment rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.82,0)">Stressed economies are also those where investment has decreased the most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.34,0)">As a result, the average unemployment rate now stands above 18% on average for the group of countries hit by financial stress  , whereas it is below 8% on average in non-stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.32,0)">Interestingly, these average unemployment rates were essentially the same before the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Against this background, what can European institutions do?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.94,0)">The ECB has reduced its key interest rate, the rate at which banks refinance themselves every week, to a historic low of 0.25%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.36,0)">We have said that, in view of the subdued outlook for inflation, we expect interest rates to remain at current or lower levels for an extended period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Additionally, we have taken several measures to ensure that euro area banks can pass on these low interest rates to the real economy, in particular where they are needed the most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">The measures include providing banks with as much liquidity as they need – against adequate collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">We have offered them the possibility of depositing additional collateral consisting of credit claims from their clients   directly with the ECB and have announced that we would intervene via Outright Monetary Transactions   to remove unwarranted risks to the integrity of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Such support has benefited directly to the stressed economies, even though they ultimately benefit the entire region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">These measures have been entirely in line with the ECB’s primary mandate of medium-term price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.78,0)">Contrary to what is sometimes said, this objective has in no way constrained our ability to act and support the euro area economy at a time of crisis, when downward pressures on prices have appeared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">These measures will however be efficient only if banks pass on to their clients the favourable financing conditions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The priority is to re-establish trust in the strength of the European banking sector and its capacity to finance the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">With this aim in mind, the ECB will become the single supervisor of around 130 of the most significant euro area banks in November 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Until then, it will conduct a comprehensive assessment of their balance sheets to create greater transparency in respect of the risks and ensure, should the assessment reveal excessive risks or insufficient capital, that they take prompt corrective action when warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Rules recently adopted or still under discussion in the European Union also ensure that shareholders and creditors will have a strong interest in banks avoiding excessive risk-taking, for a simple reason: they will now be first in line to absorb possible losses, rather than taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.63,0)">Let me be clear on this: the time when taxpayers were first in line to bail out banks is behind us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.69,0)">Banks’ senior managers will also be held responsible: the new framework sets a cap on executive remuneration as long as a given bank is undergoing restructuring or relying on state support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">These new principles complement all the international rules adopted under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board and which aim to put the financial system on a sounder footing, as well as other measures under discussion, such as the separation of banks’ proprietary trading, on which the European Commission will shortly submit a proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.31,0)">For many European citizens, these reforms take too much time and they question the reassuring words they can hear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.85,0)">I understand their impatience, but this is about changing a system as a whole, and it takes time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">While making the financial system sounder is key to recovering investment, further steps are needed to support job creation in a sustainable way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">These measures are the responsibility of states, either individually or in a coordinated way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">The euro area economies can become fairer and more competitive, for instance, by removing the barriers to entry in the labour market, which protect those with a job but reduce opportunities for the unemployed, especially the young.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Likewise, it is also possible to reduce barriers to entry in goods and products markets, which maintain artificially high prices for the benefit of a few, and create obstacles to entrepreneurship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It is a matter of both efficiency and fairness, and imposes no burdens on public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is necessary to create a climate that favours business investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.07,0)">Given the above figures, there will be no sustainable recovery in employment without a pick-up in productive investment, and that pick-up is also likely to rebalance growth in Europe, which is weak today because it relies too much on demand from the rest of the world, which is uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Our social model  are only as sustainable as our public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.6,0)">We therefore need to rebalance fiscal revenues and expenditures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.03,0)">This rebalancing will undoubtedly weigh down on growth over the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.44,0)">But not keeping public debt and deficit in check would be tantamount to accepting that an ever greater share of fiscal revenues is channelled towards servicing debt instead of financing collective action – which comes down to accepting a loss of sovereignty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.54,0)">It is also as if the state, in the future, gives up performing its function of consolidating the economy during a slowdown or a crisis – but there will be other downturns and other crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.06,0)">When debt does not result from crisis action or from socially valuable investment, it is unfair to future generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.69,0)">We cannot build future growth on new debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">This consolidation will promote growth sooner or later only if it is used as a lever to make public spending more efficient, notably in the form of investment in R&D, and education and training.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">These adjustments to our social model are not forced by the crisis, and even less so by Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.3,0)">In all the large countries, the crisis has simply revealed trends that were unsustainable, encouraged by an unchecked financial environment which allowed the financing of untenable promises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">In the five years preceding the financial crisis, the annual rate of growth of public spending exceeded that of GDP by 0.25 points in the euro area, by 1.5 points in the United States and 2 points in Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For each of these steps, there is both a national and a European dimension: each Member State has to act in the knowledge that what happens domestically has direct implications for the rest of the monetary union, while recognising that what happens in the rest of the union will also impact on its own situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This is the only way we can create the basis for shared responsibility and solidarity in EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">This leads me to my third point: if we are to strengthen responsibility and solidarity in EMU, we need a strong political dimension to accompany financial, economic and fiscal integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Reinstating the political dimension of the European project Together, we Europeans have created and developed public goods that make us stronger, such as the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">These are our shared res publicae.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">To be properly managed, they need a well-functioning and legitimate political system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In words which will be familiar to us, the res publica needs a republic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The European “republic”   in my view does not mean a European state, but rather a widely shared agreement on the scale and management of the goods we have in common, with a view to contributing to our ultimate goals: peace, democracy and shared prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">So what could be the pillars of a renewed political project for Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, a common culture It is often suggested that Jean Monnet said “if I had to do it again, I would first start through culture”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Given the emphasis on social and economic policies in European integration, a shared European culture should include common economic and social understanding and values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In this respect, and limiting myself to the economic domain, if something can be learnt from the crisis, it is that we share responsibility for preserving financial stability in the light of spillover effects and interlinkages within Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.8,0)">In addition, growth should not be pursued at all costs, and certainly not on the back of unsustainable policies leading to debt overhang and macroeconomic imbalances, which inevitably lead to costly adjustments in terms of activity, employment and social protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">At the same time, risk-taking must be at the service of entrepreneurship, not of financial speculation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Common values imply exemplary institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.65,0)">This is true in terms of ethics; in this respect, EU institutions in general and the ECB in particular have enacted strict codes of conduct for their staff members and senior executives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">This is also true in terms of offering equal opportunities and promoting diversity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In the words of Jorge Semprun, “Europe cannot be based on the exclusion of diversity; it must be built on the essential unity of diversity”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">The ECB has recently launched an initiative to promote gender diversity, including detailed targets at management level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">These efforts would be significantly complemented if Member States were also to promote this diversity in the ECB’s top decision-making body, the Governing Council – which consists solely of men.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">A second pillar should be European cohesion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">From the domestic perspective, cohesion entails having a common understanding of fairness and showing solidarity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Cohesion also – and notably – means clarifying the rights and responsibilities between member countries so that it is based on mutual trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">It also implies that Member States should submit to stronger fiscal, economic and financial governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Once trust is established, the social contract between member countries – solidity with solidarity – can be expressed in a variety of ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">One way is by having public and private mutual insurance against shocks: the European Stability Mechanism already provides a public safety net, while Europe-wide insurance mechanisms financed by banks would allow the costs arising from the resolution of banks to be covered   and, ultimately, depositors to be protected  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Another way is to combine resources for the provision of public goods at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">For instance, shared public investment in research and development   and network infrastructures help to “denationalise” industrial policy, thereby aiding the functioning of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Any steps beyond that would imply identifying common sources of funding, either in the form of common tax resources or of common issuance of public debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.53,0)">Tax or financial techniques are, however, no substitute to politics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Such common sources of funding could only be envisaged after the establishment of a genuine fiscal union among euro area Member States that includes a sharing of fiscal sovereignty and proper accountability vis-à-vis the European Parliament and national parliaments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.89,0)">Without that framework, the fiscal union would not be democratic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">This does not imply that it will never happen: for instance, it could start on a limited scale around common projects, jointly financed and aimed at enhancing long-term growth in the region in a way that benefits to all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There is also an external dimension to cohesion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">It is in our relationship with the world that we become aware of our European identity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">When asked in Eurobarometer surveys which policies they would want to see transferred to the European level, a majority of Europeans point to foreign policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.14,0)">However, the external dimension of the European project has so far remained underdeveloped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Strong external powers were transferred to the European level only as regards trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">More could be done, with a view to bringing together scarce resources, defending European interests globally and pushing the European agenda in respect of “global common goods”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This is not only about selling products that create jobs in our economies, but also about being able to exert influence on the future course of globalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Europe, if it were to speak with one voice in international financial fora, would be in a stronger position to shape global policy outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">In this regard, creating a unified euro area representation in global economic fora would be consistent with the very high level of economic and financial integration in EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The two euro area countries that each have a permanent seat on the IMF Executive Board, France and Germany, could lead by example and merge their seats.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">The third pillar would be the strengthening of democratic accountability at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Trust in EU institutions rests on both input legitimacy   and output legitimacy  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Concretely, this means citizens must be confident that EU institutions are democratically accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">For the ECB, this means fulfilling its democratically assigned mandate of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.04,0)">It also implies resisting the temptation to act in ways that are not compliant with this mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">To give a few examples: it is within our mandate to provide liquidity to banks so that they can fund the economy, but it is not in our mandate to provide them with capital in place of their shareholders and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is within our mandate to eliminate financial market distortions that hamper the effectiveness of our monetary policy, but it is not in our mandate to ensure the solvency of states or to aim at distributing wealth between countries in place of democratically elected governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.41,0)">There is sometimes a thin line between these choices, which call for the monetary authorities to show judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Hence, we need transparency and accountability vis-à-vis the general public and the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This takes the form of a monthly press conference, extensive reporting, public hearings in the European Parliament and replies to MEPs’ written questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB will also be examining how it can enhance the transparency of its decision-making processes and how it could publish an account of its monetary policy discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This will also be the case for the new bank supervisory tasks that the ECB will assume.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In this regard, the ECB has agreed to an Inter-Institutional Agreement with the European Parliament that foresees extensive information and reporting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Ensuring a high degree of democratic accountability is also key for European political institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This is particularly important given the increase during the crisis of the degree of European intrusion into national economic and fiscal policies, which have re-distributional consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.93,0)">For instance, concerns have been voiced that European support to countries under stress, and the conditions on which it is granted, are decided only by the Eurogroup, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.73,0)">by governments of euro area countries, themselves subject to parliamentary controls of very different kinds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Stronger involvement by the European Parliament could be a way to alleviate such concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">It would be similarly important for European issues to feature more prominently in national parliamentary affairs and in national conversations so that citizens can allow their voices to be heard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">But above all, only in a truly European public space can common solutions emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">We can witness today a renationalisation of European politics, including when it comes to protest against European policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.05,0)">This renationalisation carries with it the seeds of an erosion of our common values.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.4,0)">Conclusion In 1935, the German philosopher Edmund Husserl warned us that “Europe’s greatest danger is weariness”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">History has proved him right already and risks proving him right once again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">To counteract that danger, we should continuously reaffirm our commitment to improving institutions and policies in Europe, in line with our common values.</span>
