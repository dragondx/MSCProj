in line with the Commission - support the work of the European Payments Council for a Single Euro Payments Euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">On ownership, further integration has been expected - for some time - but more seems likely to happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.9,0)">The desire to realise scale economies, fear to fall behind the US, excess capital and limits reached in domestic consolidation will be the main drivers for cross-border takeovers and mergers in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.62,0)">What can policy makers and researchers do?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">They can identify the fields for action, prepare the ground for change and explain the process to the actors involved and the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.52,0)">This is our daily life in market operations, payment services, security and settlement services and in the regulatory debates that we are engaged in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.05,0)">The Single Passport and the single currency opened the gate, but the race started with some delay: domestic consolidation took place first – the number of banks in Europe was reduced by a quarter from 8600 to 6600.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Nevertheless, there are already some results: With the single currency, the European unsecured money market is now perfectly integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The active support of the ECB for standardisation has had positive impact, for example, on the short-term paper market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.28,0)">Underwriting fees for corporate bonds have reacted to the creation of the larger market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We have seen the reduction in the cost of capital and the valuation of large firms in the euro area has increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The euro has become the preferred international debt issuance currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In the first quarter of 2005, sixty-three percent of the total net international debt issuance was denominated in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The ECB recently took some first steps towards the introduction of a single list for the collateral, which market participants use for the ECB credit operations – 300 billion every week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The aim of the single list is to replace the current two-tier system of eligible collateral, in order to enhance the level playing field in the euro area, to further promote equal treatment for counterparties and issuers, and to increase the overall transparency of the collateral framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">For short, the Single List will improve European financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Most advances from the introduction of the euro on European financial markets I just reported are micro-financial in nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Micro-financial research has an important role at the ECB, as we are called upon to contribute to the broader debate on the post FSAP strategy, to shape the best financial environment for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Still the core business of the ECB is to conduct monetary policy for the euro area, to which macro-financial research can contribute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For instance, research on the yield curve for instance brings information on how expectations are changing across the business cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Combining both the micro and macro financial research, Philipp Hartmann, Head of the Financial Research Division of the ECB, will now present a paper on “The impact of the euro on financial markets”, co-authored with Lorenzo Cappiello, Peter Hördhal, Arjan Kadareja and Simone Manganelli.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Their research focuses on stock and bond markets, a segment yet unexplored with regards to the impact of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.0,0)">They investigate correlations among euro-area equity returns   and changes in government bond pricing  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The paper will be discussed by Professors Xavier Vives and Bruno Gerard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.68,0)">Xavier Vives is Professor of Economics and Finance at INSEAD.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.04,0)">He is also a Research Fellow of the Center for Economic Policy Research   and served as Director of its Industrial Organization Program in 1991-1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Bruno Gerard is Professor of Finance at the Norwegian School of Management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">He is also a Professor at CentER, the financial institute of Tillburg University in the Netherlands.</span>
