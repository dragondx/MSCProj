    <span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)"> TRANSCRIPT Q&A at UBS event Transcript of Q&A session following a fireside chat with Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at an online UBS event on the European economic and policy outlook, conducted on 30 October 2020 4 November 2020 President Lagarde stressed in yesterday's decision that there had been unanimity in the analysis, and also in the need to take action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.86,0)">But, of course, no action was taken yesterday, and so it wasn't entirely clear to me what exactly there was unanimity on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.35,0)">And also, given the pre-announcement, isn't there a risk of raising expectations too much and underwhelming them in the end?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There was unanimity insofar as everyone agreed that we are facing high uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Looking backwards we were quite confident that all the measures taken, not only on the monetary policy side but also on the fiscal side, at the national level, at the European level and on the regulatory side, were showing strong effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We will see an uptick in economic activity in the third quarter, maybe even going into double-digits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">And so looking backwards we have reasons to be satisfied with the performance of the different policymakers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.1,0)">However, looking forward, the situation has suddenly taken a turn for the worse, even if in our baseline it was already foreseen that there would be a second wave.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.31,0)">A second wave was firmly part of our forecast, but what is new is the extent of the deterioration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.69,0)">Now, the reaction of the different governments to this second wave has been quite different from the generalized lockdowns that we experienced during the first wave.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.68,0)">And therefore, before we can see what the economic consequences of this second wave are, we need to take into account the scope of the shutdowns that are being engineered in the different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">But we also need to take into account the additional fiscal support that is being discussed and decided upon every day in the member states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Before having clear indications on the direction and the consequences of this second wave, it would have been surprising to be able to properly design and engineer a monetary policy response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But we signaled that we are ready to to look at our toolbox, to recalibrate or to rectify or to adjust – whatever term you want to use – all our instruments in order to take into account the new situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">And we are all in agreement that in the new situation we need to recalibrate what we have been doing, and recalibration also means assessing the efficiency of the instruments in the new circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">So in terms of the effectiveness of the policy response so far, which of the tools that the ECB has deployed do you think have been most effective?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And which instruments you see mostly likely to be used going forward?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In order to measure effectiveness, you have to be in agreement what you are talking about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">We acted on two fronts: One was providing a backstop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.71,0)">We had market turbulence which we needed to bring to a halt with a sufficient amount of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">From that point of view, I think both our pandemic emergency purchase programme, PEPP, and above all our liquidity provisioning instruments, PELTRO and TLTRO, were quite effective in providing the necessary liquidity to the different markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">I think this backstop has been extremely effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">But we also have the asset purchases both under the regular programme, which has been continuing, and the new programme with an increased amount of flexibility allowing us to be much more surgical and to maintain the monetary transmission mechanism throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">And that was also a signal for our monetary policy stance overall, where the PEPP has been supportive too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">So looking backwards, I think there is agreement in the Governing Council, I would say unanimous agreement, that in the first wave the reaction of monetary policy was highly efficient and effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Now, of course, we are entering a new phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The reaction is different this time, and we have to take into account the reaction on the fiscal side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">There is probably a need for more fiscal action in these circumstances since it is not for monetary policy to extend credit to individual companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">That is a fiscal task, and we have encouraged the fiscal side to expand this intervention in view of the challenges that we are facing in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Your Governing Council colleague Robert Holzmann this morning said that the ECB may think of new instruments by December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Coming from a person who is seen as very much on the hawkish side of the spectrum, I guess people took note of that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">What is your view in terms of things that haven't been tried yet like purchasing bank bonds, bank loans, or even equity ETFs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Is it the time to get more creative?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.46,0)">In my opinion it's certainly not the time to launch an auction of who says more and who goes further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We'll do an examination within the existing framework of the committees of the ESCB, the European System of Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">And we will assess the existing instruments that are already operating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">We will see to what extent each of these instruments are considered to be efficient, and especially marginally efficient, because some of these instruments have been there for a prolonged time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.02,0)">And there might also be a discussion whether their marginal efficiency may be waning over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.58,0)">And this has to be discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We also have to be very open to discuss potential negative effects or secondary effects that might accompany some of these instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And as always we have to be legally sound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">That means we have to look at our instruments in order to assess whether they are 1) necessary, 2) appropriate, and 3) proportionate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This work will be done in the coming weeks, also on the basis of the fiscal response in the different member states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And let me add another element.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">It is also important that the confidence boost from the European action is being extended by a rapid implementation of the decisions that have been taken at the highest level in the European Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.6,0)">We cannot be losing time now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.47,0)">The other thing that has been much talked about following yesterday's ECB communication is rate cuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We have now almost four basis points of cuts priced for December, and for next year about 12 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.68,0)">Do you see a scenario where yet deeper negative rates would make sense?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We have always said that the primary instrument of a central bank are interest rates, and that we still have this instrument available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But at the same time – as I have just said – we also have to assess potential negative effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">And we have also to assess efficiency, not only short-term but also medium-term, because for some of the instruments there are quality effects insofar as negative rates would have to be extended to the retail sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.91,0)">This would obviously be a very uphill struggle in terms of defending the reputation and confidence with European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">All this has to be factored into our discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">So nothing is ruled out, but nothing is a given.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In terms of asset purchases, conceptually there's a difference between PEPP, which is an emergency pandemic program, and regular asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.96,0)">If there was a decision to buy more assets, is it obvious that that would still be under the pandemic program?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Or if the monetary stance needs to be made more accommodative should it be regular asset purchases?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This will without any doubt be part of our discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">What is the most appropriate response and what are the most appropriate instruments under present circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">To some extent that depends also on the forcefulness of the new fiscal measures that are being decided and implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.16,0)">And it depends on the time axis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.33,0)">This pandemic will probably be a little bit longer with us than had been foreseen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.49,0)">That obviously would then have to be reflected in the timeline of the instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.33,0)">So one possibility is the extension on the time axis of some of the instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">The other is an increase in pace and scope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.65,0)">And then you can have tweaks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">You can make the instruments more surgical and more targeted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.77,0)">So all of our instruments will be under examination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Rather than a step-by-step approach, we decided to have a comprehensive answer at our next monetary policy meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.17,0)">Yields and peripheral spreads are close to records lows, does that mean that further asset purchases actually aren't that powerful anymore, and maybe not the right instrument given that the market may have gone as far as it can?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Well, most of the asset purchases have taken place in the sovereign sector and there is a huge amount of new debt coming forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.9,0)">So if you maintain your existing fire power that would mean that in relative terms it might diminish compared to the overall economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So all these factors will have to be weighted in terms of their efficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">I also think that we will have a discussion on the need of using the flexibility associated with some of our emergency instruments compared to our normal unconventional instruments, like for example, the Asset Purchase Program   compared to the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program   which allows increased flexibility in terms of the assets we buy, the scope and the jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">We do not seem to have such a big issue anymore with the monetary policy transmission mechanism.Thishas allowed us to allocate our purchases much closer to our benchmark, the capital key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">So all of this will again be discussed to see what is the most appropriate way to address the weaknesses in our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">And for the moment, fiscal policy seems most appropriate because of the issues on the demand side, of consumers being affected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.33,0)">These are issues which are much better addressed by direct fiscal policy, especially also if there is an increase in unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.73,0)">Just one more question on asset purchases, and specifically the legal situation: There's always a lot of debate among investors regarding self-imposed constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">We see the Bank of England, for example, apparently feeling comfortable buying up to 70% of any issues while the ECB has put a much more narrow 33% limit on itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Could these limits be pushed higher?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We are bound not by self-imposed limits but by red lines which are of a constitutional nature and which are in the treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The self-imposed limits only serve to respect those constitutional limits, which are not at our disposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The European Court of Justice has reconfirmed that if we enjoy a broad degree of discretion, this discretion must be exercised in a way that allows continued judicial scrutiny of what we are doing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.83,0)">Otherwise, discretion is at risk of becoming arbitrary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We therefore always have to establish a framework that is publicly available and allows judicial scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.32,0)">That is the reason why we have what some people call self-imposed constraints.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.39,0)">And the 33% limit has to do with the fact that we do not want to be involved in a potential debt restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">You compare us to the UK, but the Bank of England buys government debt, not local debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.42,0)">I don't know any other jurisdiction which uses local debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I think in Switzerland the SNB would not buy cantonal debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.88,0)">In the US, the Fed does not buy state debt, they buy federal debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">That is why we are buying a much higher percentage of what we call the supras, the supranational debt of European institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">The Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme has disenfranchised itself of some of these constraints in response to the consequences of the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But it still keeps a certain amount of constraints, like for example the benchmark of the capital key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And this remains part of our programme and of our framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">We are committed to this framework because in a democracy we are subject to judicial scrutiny and the rule of law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In Europe, most of the funding of the economy is done via the banking system, unlike in the US for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.74,0)">But broadly speaking the European banking system is in a weak state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">What could the ECB do to further help the banks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.47,0)">This week your colleague Andrea Enria, the head of the ECB Supervisory Board , argued for a bad bank as a potential solution?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">We are very much focused on having the banking system continue its intermediation and capital allocation role to the most productive parts of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.64,0)">The banks also have to take the decision which parts of the economy are beyond what is considered viable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is not something that should be exercised by the public sector, because that is not a part of a functioning market economy, which again is a constitutional obligation for us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.23,0)">Banks by nature are to some extent pro-cyclical, and that is exactly the reason why in the first wave of the pandemic we flooded the whole system with an enormous amount of liquidity to maintain the credit flow to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">This was extremely efficient as the amount of credit to the economy, according to the latest statistics, still stood at 7% of GDP in September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.12,0)">But it is inevitable that if you have an economic slowdown there will be a deterioration of asset quality and an increase of NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Part of this has been attenuated and mitigated by moratoria and public guarantees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.19,0)">And that is why we have not seen such the surge of non-performing loans as in the financial crisis of 2008-2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.34,0)">But there will inevitably be a deterioration of asset quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We have also provided the banks with regulatory and operational relief.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">And those measures, all in all, have been equivalent to more than three times the total profits that were paid out by European banks in the last year before the pandemic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">So there have been many measures on the regulatory and supervisory side, and on the monetary side, to have the banks continue providing liquidity and credit to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We have to see whether some of the fiscal measures – moratoria and public guarantees – will be prolonged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.95,0)">In some countries, they were supposed to slow down or come to an end this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.66,0)">In other countries they have already been extended until the middle of next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.32,0)">So we have to see in the coming weeks what the European response will be as that will have an immediate effect on the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">We want to avoid a financial amplification of real economy issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There are always proposals how we could take the next step before the previous step has been accomplished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">And for me, the most important step is to accomplish the banking union and to have a deposit guarantee scheme throughout the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">For me that is a precondition for considering anything like an asset management company.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.58,0)">A second issue that has to be discussed in relation to this proposal is whether we see a market failure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">If so, governments have to step in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And then a third element, according to the treaties – again, I’m always going back to the treaties – is that what can be done at the national level should be done at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Why transfer onto the European level problems that originate at the national level?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Once we have not only a single supervisor, but also a common deposit insurance scheme, a common resolution scheme, and a capital markets union, an asset management company for cross-border banks' assets would also make sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But we have a long way to go.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">And maybe as a first step we could start with having a common database - that would already be very helpful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.09,0)">If the ECB saw bank lending getting worse, how would you further incentivize the banks to take up even more TLTRO funds, how low and how long would you be prepared to go with negative rates that the banks can benefit from?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Again, we should always weigh the very short-term benefits with the medium/long-term costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And if we forced the banks to twist their risk assessment in order to increase bad loans on their balance sheet, we would risk to alleviate the real economy problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">There would be financial amplification of economic problems in the medium and long-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">We have to make sure that the financial intermediation system is safe and resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.11,0)">That is the task of the supervisor and its regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Monetary policy can make sure that there is no shortcoming of either collateral or liquidity available for banks to continue to support viable borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.12,0)">But we will not force the banks to willfully deteriorate their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.68,0)">We have written to the banks recently that they must not be in a situation where they don’t know anymore whether the loans are not being repaid because of moratoria or because of deteriorating underlying credit quality of the borrower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.24,0)">In the latter case, such loans have to be reclassified as unlikely to be repaid once the moratoria come to an end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">It's very important that the banks continue to make a proper assessment of the credit worthiness of their borrowers and debtors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">They must continue to remain in close contact with and monitor their clients in order to avoid a loss of visibility of the quality of their future assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.16,0)">One specific question is on the dividend ban.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">What can you tell us about potential future scenarios in terms of a Fed model, payout cap, delay, catchup?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.68,0)">Let me say first that a dividend ban is a blanket instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.81,0)">It's an exceptional measure that has to remain temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.06,0)">Having said that, if you receive public money then it is not to pay out private shareholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Now there are different possibilities to arrange things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The Swiss have found quite an interesting way to try and accommodate both objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">We have done it differently, and we have many people taking a very keen interest, from the European Parliament to the ESRB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.73,0)">When the pandemic stroke, the lockdowns imposed were very general and across the board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.35,0)">The dividend ban was also general and across the board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This time around in the second wave, we see that the reactions are much more targeted, even surgical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I think there are arguments to remain very conservative as to the principle of dividend distribution, avoiding public support being privatized and paid out to private shareholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">But there are also situations which would warrant a return to more normal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.57,0)">If for example the capital available and the distance to the maximum distributable amount was very big, a certain amount could be resumed for dividend payouts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.28,0)">But this is a discussion that has to be continued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We will not take a decision until we have further evidence from the economic fallout of the second wave, like for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That is the reason why we will only have this discussion in mid-December when we have the renewed certainty of what is the economic fallout, and also what is the quality of capital planning of the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And if there is the same amount of uncertainty, that will of course not encourage us to revert too rapidly to what I would call the normal situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">But as always in life, we will probably have to follow a middle way, taking into account what is the evolution of the world around us and employ our instruments accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.53,0)">One more question on the exchange rate side: if currency strength was a problem, how would you look at asset purchases versus further rate cuts?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Do you see a difference in terms of exchange rate impact, and could this play a role?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">From a purely analytical point of view, you will have seen the studies which make the distinction between the different instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But we do not design our instruments to target exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Our objective is price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Exchange rates do not drive the design of our instruments, but they are an element that we continue to monitor because it influences other variables which are very important for our price stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.26,0)">I would call it a secondary effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Looking a little bit further out towards the strategic review: how much inspiration do you take from the Fed in terms of their change of the strategic framework, and is average inflation targeting something that you could see for the ECB as well?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.28,0)">The Fed has different objectives and operates in a different structural environment of the economy than is the case in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.31,0)">We are a much more bank-financed economy, and capital markets play a lesser role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">We also do not have a dual objective, we have a single priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">That is what is driving us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">We of course take note of the Fed's adjustment, but we will follow what we have in our constitution, our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">We have to obey the treaty and our statutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">And we also want to be understood by our

go for an attitude of make-up?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.76,0)">If you have 20 years of below target, does that mean you need 20 years above target?</span><span
