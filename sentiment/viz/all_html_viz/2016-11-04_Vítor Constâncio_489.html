    <h3> Speaker: Vítor Constâncio </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)"> Challenges for future monetary policy frameworks: A European perspective Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, at the 19th Annual International Banking Conference, “Achieving Financial Stability: Challenges to Prudential Regulation”, Chicago, 4 November 2016 Luncheon speeches should be thought-provoking and entertaining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.3,0)">Unfortunately, that’s a dual mandate that’s beyond the ability of this central banker to deliver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">But if I cannot provide entertainment, allow me to at least provide some thoughts to hopefully provoke some discussion over our meal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">To do this, allow me to deviate a little from the main theme of the conference and turn to another topic of common interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.3,0)">In a cursory and compressed way, I would like to make some remarks on the ongoing debate about the future of monetary policy frameworks, a subject that has become quite topical here in the U.S. We are now nine years after the beginning of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Considering the role of an overstretched monetary policy to stave off a deeper recession, the following questions were bound to emerge: has monetary policy done enough, should it continue along the same path?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.54,0)">Are low, or even negative, rates a permanent feature of monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Should the size and composition of the central bank balance-sheet continue to be used as an unconventional tool?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Should the flexible inflation targeting regime continue to be the dominant framework?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Should the target for inflation be increased, or should we adopt a nominal GDP or price-level target instead?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Should monetary policy closely follow a concrete rule like, for instance, a Taylor Rule?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.44,0)">Should we assume a neo-Fisherian framework and admit that there are multiple economic equilibria and that rates should be increased to avoid leaving the economy stuck in a low level one?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Should the operational implementation of monetary policy go beyond short-term market rates or beyond banks as counterparties?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.68,0)">Finally, have these questions a different meaning when addressed from Europe or from the U.S.?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These questions are at the forefront of central banking discussion at present, as evidenced by the Jackson Hole gathering this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.94,0)">They are also debated by academia, the blogosphere and at official conferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.22,0)">Be reassured, though, I will not address most of them at this occasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.3,0)">The topic is too vast and my remarks would be scattered and incomplete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Instead, I will focus on the questions surrounding the choice of target and the choice of instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">The debate is, unsurprisingly, more advanced here in the U.S. than in Europe, given the stronger recovery and policy normalisation already under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.23,0)">Logically, this raises questions about the future use of unconventional instruments and the efficiency of policy regimes to deal with a possible future recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The debate is embryonic in Europe, as the recovery remains moderate, with economic growth and inflation only recently starting to gain momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Furthermore, the debate will necessarily be more constrained given that the ECB’s hierarchical mandate, defined in primary law, confers absolute primacy to price stability over other secondary objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In fact, the debate about the dominant monetary policy regime – Flexible Inflation Targeting   – started immediately after the emergence of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.74,0)">There were doubts about whether the narrow objective of monetary policy had allowed the crisis to develop by not reacting to the signs of financial instability and asset price booms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The question about the integration of financial stability concerns into the objective function of monetary policy has stayed with us, in spite of the fragile consensus that such concerns should be the purview of macroprudential policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.94,0)">More recently, further doubts about FIT arose over the inability of monetary policy to engineer a quicker recovery, strong enough to bring the economy back to its previous trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.66,0)">Besides placing too much faith in monetary policy, this also opens the discussion about the targets of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Changing central banks’ targets In that discussion, a popular proposal is to adopt a target for nominal GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">There are clear merits to nominal income targeting from a theoretical perspective, since it is a close approximation to the optimal policy prescribed by standard macroeconomic models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Under perfect credibility, such a target is fully consistent with maintaining price stability in the medium run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">The proposal made by Meade, back in 1978, has had many illustrious supporters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">It offers the rationale to accommodate cost or supply side shocks that impact inflation and would have led to more expansionary policies since the crisis to counter the growing GDP deviation from the previous growth trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.5,0)">The proposal faces, however, considerable practical difficulties: from GDP data that is untimely and prone to revision to the demanding task of communicating to the public about a concept they do not directly experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.21,0)">Another implementation obstacle relates to uncertainty over potential output, which risks nominal GDP targets delivering higher inflation without any benefit for real economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.19,0)">That said, as shown for instance by Charles Bean  ,  the practical difference between nominal GDP targeting and inflation targeting is not substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">FIT permits policymakers to look through short-term supply shocks, monetary policy would be similarly accommodative in the case of aggregate demand shocks under either type of target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Long ago, Lars Svensson showed how FIT, by aiming to return to the target only gradually, is equivalent to the use of an objective function with both inflation and the output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Finally, it is not easy for monetary policy to deliver a nominal income target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The enthusiasm of the supporters of the market monetarism school - believing that monetary aggregates could do the job – stands out as empirically unfounded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.77,0)">So while a nominal income target may be theoretically superior, I remain very sceptical of its practical use, above and beyond the legal constraints that inhibit its adoption in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">A concept that seems close to a nominal income target is the adoption of a type of Taylor rule to conduct monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.52,0)">Lars Svensson would insist on the distinction between a targeting rule and an instrument rule, which is a formula for setting the central bank’s instrument rate as a function of target variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.12,0)">He has pointed out the shortcomings of the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.64,0)">Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe    have also showed how Taylor rules combined with a zero lower bound would lead to multiple equilibria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.16,0)">It is not by chance that no central bank has ever committed to following an instrument rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">The problem of the lower bound on interest rates led some economists  to propose an increase in the inflation target to create more room above the lower bound to respond to future recessionary episodes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.75,0)">However, changing the inflation objective at a time when outcomes have been below the current objective for a number of years, risks damaging central banks credibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Changing the objective, say to 4%, would only be effective if inflation expectations were successfully re-anchored at the higher level, which would be unattainable in present circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Changing the policy instruments: negative rates Turning now to the domain of instruments, let me start with negative interest rates, which have been used across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.16,0)">The central bank deposit rate is negative in the euro area, Switzerland and Sweden, with the main Swedish policy rate also negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Negative rates have been effective in lowering the whole spectrum of short-term rates, and also at longer maturities via expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">In this perspective, it has been a good complement to quantitative easing  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">The intention behind the policy has always been temporary – to boost aggregate demand, closing the output gap more quickly, helping to normalise inflation and subsequently interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Only if central banks were to allow prolonged deflation could negative rates be considered a permanent instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.16,0)">Outside such an environment, the accumulated negative spillovers of negative rates on the profitability of financial institutions, and the interference on the role of monetary and financial assets as a store of value, would be unacceptable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.15,0)">The long-term consequences of an environment with low but positive inflation and negative rates would become too severe for the financial sector, savers and pensioners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In the short term though, ECB research has shown that the effect on the profitability of financial institutions has been overall positive, as they benefited from capital gains associated with asset price increases and, in the case of banks, from lower funding and impairment costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.94,0)">These effects, however, decline with time and are likely to fade out at some point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In spite of these shortcomings, there are several economists supporting the idea that negative rates should be used practically without limit, and for that to be possible, they propose to abolish cash altogether,  which has some theoretical benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Monetary policy would no longer be constrained by the lower bound, providing ample room for manoeuver to counteract severe cyclical downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Banks would be free to reduce their deposit rates, without the fear of customers withdrawing their money, and to increase their net interest margins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.3,0)">Abolishing cash would also hamper some illegal activities and improve transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Finally, society would benefit economically from eliminating the non-trivial costs of storing and using cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.17,0)">Also theoretically, as all economic agents are supposed to think in real terms, further decreasing negative rates should be equivalent to reducing positive rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Money illusion however, is more widespread than economists presume.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.36,0)">There are important drawbacks that raise concerns about this proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.84,0)">While eliminating certain illegal activities is desirable, people should have the right to privacy on their legal activities, on which full transparency to governments and, more importantly, to businesses would be unwarranted and intrusive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Furthermore, as already mentioned, money should continue to perform its function of store of value, which the ability to impose negative interest rates clearly violates outside continuous deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">In the light of all these uncertainties, a prudent policy maker would advise to be very cautious before proceeding with these radical proposals, even if digitalisation may gain ground and finally prevail – as we start to observe in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Changing the policy instruments: size and composition of balance-sheets Traditionally, central banks used short-term interest rates to steer the economy and the pre-crisis wisdom was to use as lean a balance sheet as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The rationale behind the lean balance sheet was to minimise the intermediation role of the central bank and related potential market distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.51,0)">At the limit, financial assets should simply mirror banknotes on the liability side of the central bank’s balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But institutional arrangements do matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.04,0)">Prior to the crisis, the Federal Reserve   dealt with a small number of counterparties and mostly held Treasuries directly on its balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">By contrast, the lack of a single fiscal issuer and a fragmented banking sector along national lines required that the ECB carried out repos with a broad range of counterparties against a broad range of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Irrespective of the different operational arrangements, central bank balance sheets on both sides of the Atlantic have grown rapidly since the onset of the crisis, and the reasons behind this growth provide useful lessons for the post-crisis world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Beyond the justifications provided by the crisis for the use of the size and composition of central banks’ balance sheets as policy instrument, there are good arguments to preserve the instrument in the policy toolkit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.49,0)">They stem from some structural changes that have occurred in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In particular: the increased role of secured money market transactions; the importance of a broad set of market rates beyond the overnight rate, in view of imperfections in arbitrage; the growing relevance of non-bank institutions in market-based finance; and finally, the scarcity of safe assets that affects the functioning of markets and the management of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">These developments are behind proposals recently presented in Jackson Hole by Duffie and Krishnamurthy   and by Greenwood, Hanson and Stein   which stress the importance of the Fed’s reverse repo programme  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">In the first paper, the programme would be used to involve more counterparties and affect several interest rates, thereby contributing to a better transmission of monetary policy, in view of the limits to arbitrage hampering the pass-through from short- to long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.24,0)">Recent internal work at the ECB also detects similar pass-through imperfections in European markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In the paper by Greenwood et al.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">, RRP is considered a way to create very short-term safe assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">It would foster financial stability by avoiding the unsuccessful attempts by the private sector to fulfil that role, as we saw before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Both arguments deserve careful consideration although they are, from a European perspective for the moment, less relevant or less urgent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In fact, the enduring predominantly bank-based nature of the European financial system allows us to consider the possibility of going back, once the situation is normalised, to lending to banks as the main channel for managing liquidity and steering short-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Nevertheless, the structural changes that I just mentioned are also growing in Europe and we have to reflect on the possible limitations of monetary policy transmission by only influencing the very short end of money-market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Better benchmark rates are needed, ideally relying on actual transaction data to improve their reliability and robustness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.97,0)">Yet, moves to improve benchmarks suffer at present from the challenge of declining transaction volumes in the unsecured interbank market although the ongoing work points to a successful conclusion of the reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The discussion of which interest rates to focus on is closely intertwined with the issue of central bank counterparties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The ECB has traditionally granted a broad range of financially sound credit institutions access to monetary policy operations.That approach enabled us to swiftly provide liquidity to various financial market segments during the crisis where more active central bank intermediation was warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Nevertheless, non-banks are beginning to play a greater role in the European financial landscape, and are likely to take an even greater role as the Capital Markets Union deepens and broadens financial markets in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Such consideration is not neutral for market rates in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.18,0)">Secured money market rates, backed by high quality collateral, have for a while been trading well below the ECB deposit facility rate, which normally sets a floor for short-term money market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.2,0)">In part, this discount is explained by non-banks’ activities that – not having access to central bank facilities – are accepting interest rates below the deposit facility rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.57,0)">The discount is, of course, also attributed to the Asset Purchase Programme which has reduced the availability of high quality collateral at the same time as market demand for that collateral has increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Nonetheless, understanding these drivers is crucial for the central bank when making decisions about future counterparty eligibility and the choice of money market rates used to assess monetary policy transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In this perspective, the path followed in the US will be of great importance for our reflections on the other side of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">A number of potential changes to monetary policy frameworks could be necessary to meet the challenges of the new economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.74,0)">I provided my thoughts on some of them, but omitted many others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.07,0)">Other challenges stem from a prolonged period of low, albeit not negative, interest rates resulting from the decline in potential growth and the demographic effects on savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.56,0)">Indeed, the apparent difficulties to reach higher levels of inflation and real equilibrium interest rates may hamper the capacity of monetary policy to deal with future recessionary episodes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.74,0)">Some economists maintain that monetary policy can do almost everything, even if it would require the use of very negative rates, either because they are against the use of fiscal policy or because they genuinely believe in some form of new monetarism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Central bankers should, however, avoid such hubris and accept that, at present, the contributions of fiscal, regulatory and competition policies are necessary to foster investment and improve the supply side of our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In view of the dimension of the challenges the world faces, I think this word of humility is a good coda for a central bank talk.</span><span
