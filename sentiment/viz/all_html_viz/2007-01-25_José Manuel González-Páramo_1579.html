    <span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)"> The challenges to liquidity management in the euro area: the perspective of the ECB Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB30th Annual European Treasury SymposiumBerlin, 25 January 2007 Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a real pleasure for me to be given the opportunity to talk at this Treasury Symposium, which over the years has become one of the major events of its kind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">And as it is already the 30th Annual European Treasury Symposium, I would like to congratulate and thank the organisers for all their efforts to make this event what it is today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The organisers have asked me to discuss the “challenges to liquidity management” and to convey the views of the ECB on this very interesting issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Of course we all know what is meant by “liquidity management”, or more precisely we all have a view on what it is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But it would perhaps be worth clarifying the concept and its implications for both the treasury departments and the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.59,0)">In short, liquidity management essentially consists in managing the short-term assets and liabilities influenced by a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">On the one hand we help to increase the need for short-term funding by imposing reserve requirements, while on the other hand we provide precisely the funding required through our monetary policy operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Although credit institutions can refinance themselves in the interbank market, it is ultimately the central bank that ensures that there is sufficient liquidity available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For the Eurosystem, as for any central bank, liquidity management goes beyond this simple and fairly mechanical approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We use liquidity management to make the monetary policy decisions taken by the Governing Council of the ECB a reality in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Indeed, like most central banks nowadays, we aim to steer short-term interest rates to bring them to a level in line with the monetary policy decision, by adjusting the supply of central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.93,0)">This raises two questions: How do we know the amount of liquidity missing in the money market?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And how do we make use of this information to influence short-term interest rates and spreads?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Answering these two questions in detail is not possible in just a few minutes, but I can at least comment on some aspects, in particular two main challenges I currently see for the Eurosystem’s liquidity management: the forecasting of autonomous factors; and the steering of short-term interest rates or – more precisely – of short-term money market spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.49,0)">The first challenge: forecasting autonomous factors First of all, what do we mean by autonomous factors?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.59,0)">These are simply those items in the central bank balance sheet that are neither monetary policy operations nor current account holdings of credit institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.18,0)">We call these factors autonomous as they are, in general, not under the control of the central bank, or at least not entirely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">To illustrate this point further, let us take a brief look at the most important autonomous factors; important in terms of their volume but also in terms of their evolution over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The first autonomous factor we should consider is the amount of banknotes in circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.58,0)">This is typically an autonomous factor because it has its own life: the quantity of banknotes in circulation is the result of the demand for banknotes by the general public, which is not under our control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Another factor is the volume of government deposits with the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.43,0)">The movements on these accounts are dependent on the payment obligations or tax collections of central or local governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.87,0)">Although there are agreements in place between national central banks and their respective treasuries to reduce the uncertainty in government deposit holdings, movements on these accounts are not under the control of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Of course, we have very precise ex post knowledge of the evolution of these autonomous factors, but because our main refinancing operations   have a one-week maturity, it is not enough to know them ex post.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">So we have to anticipate them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">That is precisely where the first challenge lies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.5,0)">In order to illustrate this point, let us take a look at a simplified, consolidated end-of-day balance sheet for the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.26,0)">In this example, we are at the end of June 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.64,0)">The balance sheet is grouped into three categories, namely: monetary policy operations; current account holdings; and autonomous factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.9,0)">Incidentally, it is the same balance sheet format we publish on a daily basis on both the ECB website and wire services  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.93,0)">The net autonomous factors are net liquidity-absorbing, which means that the banking sector faces a lack of liquidity, mainly owing to the high amount of outstanding banknotes in circulation  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.25,0)">In other words the banking system is operating within a liquidity deficit against the Eurosystem which is further enforced by reserve requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.73,0)">Autonomous factors need to be forecast and – as is the nature of forecasts – are thus uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">What we need to ensure in the Eurosystem is that these forecasts are unbiased, so that the likelihood for us to over or underestimate autonomous factors is broadly equal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.8,0)">Autonomous factors, reserve requirements and excess reserves   represent the demand for central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In order to avoid systematic recourse to standing facilities, the liquidity-providing operations – namely the MROs – need to be adjusted to this demand for liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The benchmark amount aims at balancing, on average, the demand for and supply of liquidity over one week, while at the same time correcting liquidity imbalances that have accumulated in the previous week.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.49,0)">As we publish the benchmark amount with every tender allotment, market participants can see immediately whether the ECB deviates from the benchmark, and this avoids misunderstandings regarding the allotment policy of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.82,0)">We aim to provide the benchmark amount, but from time to time we see the need to deviate from this concept.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In order to understand the underlying complexity of the autonomous factors’ forecasts, one needs to bear in mind that the Eurosystem’s balance sheet is composed   of 14 individual balance sheets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.97,0)">Each balance sheet has its own characteristics which can affect the development of autonomous factors in a different manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Some national central banks hold a relatively high share of deposits by their central government and need to be experienced in forecasting movements on these accounts on a day-to-day basis, while other national central banks focus only on their potential purchases and redemptions in their own investment portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Forecast expertise is distributed throughout the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.91,0)">This is a chart showing the evolution of banknotes in circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.26,0)">Before 2002, the graph naturally refers to the banknotes denominated in the old legacy currencies but expressed in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">When looking at this graph, one immediately recognises a time series with strong seasonalities and growth components: The main seasonalities in the graph are in particular a strong increase over the Christmas period and a gradual relative increase over the summer months during the main holiday season in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">These seasonalities are very difficult to forecast with accuracy but have the advantage that they have not changed with the cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The patterns of the past can still be applied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We can observe a modest growth of banknotes since 1999, interrupted only by the decline occurring during the euro cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">We also see the strong impact of the frontloading of banknotes on the first days of January 2002, when the euro banknotes in the vaults of commercial banks were converted from paper into legal tender literally overnight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">After the cash changeover, however, we observed growth rates in banknotes that did not resemble any previous experience in banknote development  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">For 2006, the annual growth rate in banknotes was 11%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.43,0)">The main explanations for this different behaviour in the growth of euro banknotes are as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.06,0)">First, they are used much more abroad than the euro area legacy currencies; and secondly, the general low level of interest rates has kept the opportunity costs for holding banknotes low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.06,0)">The Eurosystem makes use of these patterns when making its forecast of banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">These are based on both expert knowledge and econometric modelling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.06,0)">The other important autonomous factor, which is very difficult to forecast, is government deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.5,0)">The movements on these accounts are mainly dependent on decisions taken by respective Ministry of Finances in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.17,0)">And although national central banks are in close contact with their respective Treasuries, the forecasts they receive are themselves based on many assumptions, such as the expected amount of a forthcoming tax collection or the uncertainty of the amount issued at a bond auction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Although there are some other autonomous factors, banknotes and government deposits are by far the most important in the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Now that I have explained some of the difficulties in making good forecasts of autonomous factors, it is time for the crucial question: how good are we in forecasting autonomous factors?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.56,0)">The chart on the left is taken from a recent article in the November 2006 issue of the ECB's Monthly Bulletin on our fine-tuning operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.55,0)">It illustrates how the accumulated forecast errors increase with the time horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.51,0)">The measure chosen is a simple standard deviation and for a horizon of six business days – the normal MRO horizon – this standard deviation amounts to €9.20 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">This increase of forecast errors with the time horizon became relevant after the changes to the operational framework in March 2004, as the average MRO horizon increased from an average of four business days under the old framework to six business days under the new framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.08,0)">This also meant an increase in the likelihood of having large liquidity imbalances during the last week of a maintenance period; when this actually materialised, the ECB started to conduct fine-tuning operations on the last day of the maintenance period on a more regular basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As we emphasised earlier, our forecasts of autonomous factors have to be unbiased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But are they?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.18,0)">The chart on the right shows the probability density function of accumulated errors over six business days in autonomous factors from 2004 to 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">The empirical distribution is actually close to normal and the statistical tests confirm that the mean forecast error is not statistically different from zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">So, with some relief we can assure you that our forecasts of autonomous factors are unbiased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.07,0)">However, we still experience large forecast errors from time to time, in particular during special periods such as Christmas or the end of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In order to make the implementation of monetary policy even more credible, we will need to further improve our forecasts of autonomous factors, in particular banknotes and government deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.22,0)">And this is one of the main challenges for the liquidity management of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.43,0)">The second challenge: steering short-term interest rates Nowadays, most central banks   aim at steering a short-term interest rate, which is either defined explicitly as a target rate   or implicitly as a signalling rate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This operational target is in many cases an overnight rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.12,0)">Central banks can steer short-term interest rates because they are the monopolistic suppliers of liquidity and are therefore able to lay down the terms for supplying it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In simple terms, our aim in the Eurosystem is to provide the liquidity needed by the banking community, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">the amount that helps banks to fulfil their reserve requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The standing facilities set a corridor of interest rates and if we supply the amount of central bank money needed by the banking community, then short-term interest rates should be close to the middle of this corridor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Reserve requirements help to reduce volatility in short-term interest rates by giving commercial banks a buffer for unexpected liquidity flows on their accounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.17,0)">To date, the Eurosystem has not had an explicit short-term interest rate target  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Owing to its large reserve requirements and the averaging provision, the Eurosystem can afford to supply the missing amount of central bank money once a week via its MROs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">So even when the actual figures for autonomous factors turn out to be different from those forecast, the large amount of reserve requirements serves as a buffer that stabilises short-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.56,0)">An explicit interest rate target would require more frequent open market operations from the Eurosystem and this was not the intention when the operational framework was designed back in 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.51,0)">Instead, the MROs – which nowadays are conducted as a variable rate tender – have a signalling rate attached, a minimum bid rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The message of such a signalling rate from the perspective of a central bank is that short-term interest rates should not deviate too much from the signalled rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.89,0)">The measure of such deviations is, of course, the spread between short-term interest rates on the one hand and the minimum bid rate on the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.91,0)">Informative spreads in this regard are the tender spread   and the EONIA spread  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">When talking about spreads, it should first be remembered that they are in fact very natural.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.54,0)">The main reason for the existence of spreads is operational differences between transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Borrowing against collateral will always be cheaper for the borrower than unsecured borrowing, as the borrower provides the lender with some protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">So it cannot come as a surprise that the spread between EONIA, for example – which is an average index of unsecured lending – and the minimum bid rate of an MRO – whereby the Eurosystem provides central bank money only against eligible collateral – is positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The credit standing of a counterparty will furthermore determine the premium other banks will charge when refinancing in the interbank market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The positive tender spread in the Eurosystem’s MRO can be easily explained with the design of the variable rate tender: a counterparty cannot be sure that it will receive funds at the minimum bid rate, as other counterparties may bid more competitively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In order for a money market to function efficiently, spreads are essential to distinguish between different operational features, credit standings and the pricing of uncertainty; in short: the pricing of risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.17,0)">Naturally, there will always be special seasonal patterns or calendar effects where spreads do not behave regularly – for example around special periods like Christmas or the end of the year – but as long as short-term spreads return to their previous levels, they may be considered as stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.71,0)">Although we do not have an explicit target spread when implementing monetary policy, we now have more than eight years’ experience to assess whether or not short-term money market spreads are deviating from their long-term averages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.57,0)">We are not too concerned about when deviations occur gradually or if they follow a seasonal pattern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">The revised operational framework, which has been applied since March 2004, has been a great achievement to ensure transparency and simplicity for both the Eurosystem and market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Balancing the supply and demand of central bank money, which is inherent in the benchmark concept, will in the long run deliver an equilibrium spread.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">We may not be able to explain all components of this spread, but as long as our forecasts of the demand are not biased, such an equilibrium spread will emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">What actually concerns us is when these changes develop their own “unusual” dynamics, as that is when we try to calm the market by countering elevated movements in short-term spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is clear by now that we influence short-term interest rate spreads via the amount of liquidity we supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">However, it is worth looking in a little more detail at how the underlying mechanism works.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.18,0)">The Eurosystem imposes reserve requirements on credit institutions which are remunerated at the average marginal MRO rate over a maintenance period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.08,0)">Reserve requirements in the Eurosystem have a buffering function, so when aggregate liquidity imbalances occur, banks are relatively relaxed at the beginning of a maintenance period as regards whether they are on schedule for fulfilling their reserve requirements or whether they are off target, simply because they can easily correct these imbalances in the remaining days of the maintenance period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.49,0)">During the beginning of a maintenance period, short-term interest rates hardly respond to underlying liquidity imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.99,0)">However, the situation changes towards the end of the maintenance period, in particular on the last day of the period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Credit institutions can no longer postpone their fulfilment of reserve requirements and will react very sensitively to changes in the aggregate liquidity supply, as interest rates respond strongly to liquidity imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.6,0)">Deviating from the benchmark will therefore have a greater impact on interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Let me finalise my intervention with a word on the evolution of the spreads in the new operational framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.82,0)">Looking back at the liquidity policy we followed in the autumn of 2003, the spreads were at an unusually low level at the start of the new framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">They did, however, increase during the summer of 2004 and, in autumn 2005, both tender and EONIA spreads seemed to follow a slight upward trend, which was not fully in line with our previous experiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The ECB communicated its uneasiness about the trend with short-term interest rate spreads and began an allotment policy, whereby it allotted above the benchmark in all MROs, with the exception of the final operation in a maintenance period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">At first, this succeeded in containing spreads, but in spring 2006, when money market spreads again showed an increasing trend, the ECB started to allot above the benchmark in the final MRO as well, which, as mentioned above, is the time when interest rates are more responsive to liquidity imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This measure actually succeeded in reducing both the tender and the EONIA spread and has been implemented frequently since.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.92,0)">We are still investigating the underlying causes for the upward pressure on short-term interest rate spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.62,0)">Owing to the fact that the magnitudes are, after all, very small – we are talking about a few basis points – and the sample period is short, it is very difficult to identify the exact causes with analytical tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">One of several factors we are investigating is the possible impact of the large volumes in each MRO, which have grown four-fold since the beginning of 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Half of this increase was caused by the shortening of the MRO maturity from two weeks to one week in March 2004, while the other half reflects the continued expansion in the liquidity deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.81,0)">As shown earlier, there have been occasions on which spreads drifted upwards in a way which could be misperceived by some as us implementing an implicit rate hike by letting spreads “drift”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.05,0)">Although this was a minority view, the ECB cannot take these allegations lightly, as it may undermine its credibility in implementing the monetary policy stance decided by the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The challenge for liquidity management in the Eurosystem remains to identify conditions – also via its allotment policy – that ensure stable short-term interest rate spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Since the introduction of the revised operational framework, experience has actually shown us that we are able to do this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">I am optimistic that the operational framework will remain robust against the forthcoming challenges that we will face in the future.</span>
