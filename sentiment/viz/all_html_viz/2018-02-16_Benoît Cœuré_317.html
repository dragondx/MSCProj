    <span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)"> Trade as an engine of growth: Prospects and lessons for Europe Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, NBRM High Level International Conference on Monetary Policy and Asset Management, Skopje, 16 February 2018 I thank you for inviting me to speak here in Skopje today .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">I would like to take this opportunity to discuss an issue which I believe is key for the economic future of Europe and particularly relevant here, in the Western Balkans: the prospects for trade as an engine of growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">For several years now, global trade growth has puzzled many observers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.56,0)">While global trade grew at about twice the rate of GDP before the crisis, it has slowed measurably since then and has often grown at the same rate as, or even below, that of global output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">However, in 2017, world import growth once again outpaced world GDP growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">The euro area is benefiting from this recovery, with export growth the highest in many years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.06,0)">In my remarks this morning, I will argue that the rebound in trade mainly reflects cyclical factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Accommodative monetary policies worldwide have succeeded in boosting growth and investment and, with them, global imports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.6,0)">Structural headwinds remain, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Maturing global value chains, geographical shifts in trade and an accelerating push towards more automation make it less likely that trade can again expand at the pace observed during the pre-crisis boom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">To the extent that trade helps lift growth, policymakers have a role to play in providing an environment that is conducive to trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">At the same time, they need to ensure that appropriate systems are in place to support workers affected by secular shifts in both trade flows and labour demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Rebound in world trade Let me start with a few facts and charts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Last year, global imports expanded by 5%, the strongest growth in seven years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">On the left-hand side of my first slide you can see that the rebound in global trade was broad-based, with both emerging and advanced economies contributing in roughly equal proportions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">On the right-hand side you can see that this by and large reflects the fast broadening of the global economic expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">At the end of last year, 75% of the economies worldwide experienced growth above their three-year averages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.88,0)">In 2016, this share was below 30%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">So, the global economy is in a much more robust state today than it was just a few years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The breakdown of extra-euro area exports also shows that the current synchronous expansion is fertile ground for a strong rebound in trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.65,0)">You can see this on the left-hand side of my next slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">By the end of last year, euro area exporters had expanded their business with virtually all of our main trading partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Growing demand from China, and emerging Asia more generally, as well as recovering demand from commodity exporters are once more contributing to, rather than subtracting from, export growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.62,0)">One exception to this benign picture is the United Kingdom, where Brexit repercussions might already be showing through in the data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Trade has also gained momentum within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.25,0)">You can see this on the right-hand side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Although intra-euro area export growth is currently somewhat weaker than extra-area growth, we can see that exports are today contributing more evenly to growth across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">It is no longer only a few Member States that are benefitting from a booming global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In particular, structural reforms and internal devaluation in formerly stressed economies, together with a protracted period of weak domestic demand during the crisis years, have prompted more firms in these economies to improve their competitiveness and thereby profit from a rise in foreign demand, both inside and outside the currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.34,0)">This is perhaps best illustrated by the share of exports in GDP on the left-hand side of my next slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Last year, compared with the period 2000 to 2007, this share rose strongly in Ireland and Slovenia, while Portugal, Greece and Cyprus also managed double-digit gains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This supported the economic recovery and helped to reduce unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">A natural side effect of these changes was a notable widening of the euro area’s current account surplus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.25,0)">You can see this on the right-hand side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.59,0)">Almost all Member States that entered the financial crisis with large current account deficits are today reporting current account surpluses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.36,0)">Of the euro area’s 19 Member States, 13 have current account surpluses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">But the chart also illustrates clearly that the rebalancing has remained limited to formerly stressed economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Up until recently, current account surpluses have continued to rise in Germany and in the Netherlands, the two export powerhouses in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.13,0)">While these surpluses undoubtedly reflect strong underlying fundamentals in terms of competitiveness, they also reflect an imbalance between domestic savings and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Higher domestic investment would therefore be a constructive way to address large current account surpluses and, at the same time, to prepare for future challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Now, does the current trade recovery bode well for the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">What are the prospects for global and euro area trade?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Will we return to an environment where trade growth persistently outpaces GDP growth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.62,0)">In answering these questions, I will distinguish between cyclical and structural factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.32,0)">Cyclical factors affecting trade growth As for the cyclical factors, empirical evidence suggests that economic growth alone is often not a sufficient condition for strong trade growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Indeed, trade did not start to lift off before we saw a nascent recovery in global investment, which had weakened significantly after the Great Recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.6,0)">On my next slide you can see that in advanced economies the share of public and private investment in output declined sharply with the advent of the crisis and has remained well below pre-crisis levels since then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">For emerging markets, the investment share had been rising but it has plateaued in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">So, the composition of growth matters for trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">Investment in particular has a relatively high import intensity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.89,0)">As a result, a slowdown in investment demand typically has a disproportionately large adverse impact on trade, relative to other GDP components.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">It is therefore no coincidence that the recovery in trade last year was led by exports of capital goods and intermediate goods, both key inputs to investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">You can see this clearly in the case of the euro area on the right-hand side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The implication is that future trade growth will depend to some extent on the sustainability of the current investment recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">For sure, continued accommodative financial conditions and business optimism will continue to support investment and hence trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">The United States has also just lowered its taxation of capital, which can be expected to further boost growth in capital formation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">In the euro area, investment is expected to remain robust due to rising corporate profits, high levels of expected earnings, and an increasing need to modernise the capital stock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Indeed, according to Eurosystem staff projections, investment in the euro area is expected to increase by just over 10% until the end of 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">So, overall, we can be confident that investment growth, and the current broad-based economic expansion more generally, will continue to support international trade in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.77,0)">Structural factors affecting trade growth Yet, while the cyclical pick-up in trade remains supportive, structural headwinds may prevent rates of trade growth returning to the levels we observed in the two decades prior to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.65,0)">In short, empirical evidence suggests that the factors that have supported extraordinary trade growth rates in the past were special and are likely, by and large, to have run their course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">For example, rapid financial deepening in emerging economies, and better access to capital markets, has helped boost trade growth in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.62,0)">But research suggests that there are likely diminishing marginal effects of finance on trade growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In other words, there appears to be a threshold – when private sector credit reaches around 100% of GDP – beyond which financial deepening no longer contributes meaningfully to trade growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">But by far the strongest factor behind the boost in trade growth prior to the crisis, but which now appears to be waning, is the international outsourcing of production processes via so-called global value chains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I would like to focus on this factor in the remainder of my remarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Global value chains involve production processes being split into a number of intermediate steps, mainly in order to exploit international factor income differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">As a result, production has become dispersed across countries, and mechanically increased the amount of trade that took place for a given final output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">You can see this clearly on my next slide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">In the past, we have seen a close relationship between global value chain growth and the share of imports in total output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The global integration of China, for example, not only increased its exports to developed economies, but it also increased its imports of raw materials and intermediate goods from neighbouring emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This boosted overall world trade relative to output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.93,0)">However, as you can see on the same slide, since the crisis we have seen a levelling-off of participation rates in global value chains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">In other words, the share of global value chain related exports and imports in total trade has stabilised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.98,0)">This means that the support for world trade from global value chains has recently faded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.98,0)">The important question to ask then is whether this levelling-off will be temporary or more permanent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.56,0)">In the view of ECB researchers, there are at least three factors that suggest that the slowdown in global value chain formation is likely to persist, at least in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The first factor relates to supply-chain risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.4,0)">You will recall that the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan caused severe supply disruptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.01,0)">Some companies discovered, the hard way, that supply chains were not transparent, rather like the fault lines in securitisation that caused the great financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.54,0)">In short, suppliers hired sub-contractors, who themselves hired sub-contractors, and so on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">As a result, an OECD report suggests that supply chains are increasingly designed to contain risks as well as costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.0,0)">Often, this implies shorter and more transparent value chains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">And given the intimate relation between digitalisation and trade, this trend could be amplified further in the future by rising cyber risk and risks to data integrity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The second factor relates to shifts in comparative advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In the past, wage differentials for unskilled labour made the international fragmentation of production processes worthwhile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Some of those wage differentials are now less marked as emerging economies continue to devel   , The Great Convergence: Information
