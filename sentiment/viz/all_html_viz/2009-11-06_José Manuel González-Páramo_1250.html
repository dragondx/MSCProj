    <span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)"> Non-standard monetary policy: Five questions about the exit Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBSeminar at the European Economics and Financial Centre,London, 6 November 2009 Introduction   I would like to thank the European Economics and Financial Centre   for organising this conference and giving me the opportunity to speak in front of such a distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is the second time I have had the honour of participating in the EEFC series of seminars; the first time being back in September 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is always a pleasure to be invited to address an audience again because it allows you to resume the dialogue already started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Back in 2006 my speech focused on the many challenges that uncertainty poses for the design of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.93,0)">Today, I would like to focus on some questions related to the exit from the ECB’s non-conventional monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.3,0)">There is no need for me to recall the start of the crisis in early August 2007, when tensions originating in the US sub-prime mortgage market spread to international money and credit markets, nor its intensification in mid-September 2008, following the filing for bankruptcy protection by Lehman Brothers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.85,0)">While the full cost of the crisis has yet to be assessed, the output contraction and job destruction observed so far   have been on a scale unseen for more than half a century.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In order to contain the impact of the crisis on the real economy and preserve price stability, central banks have engaged in an aggressive cutting of policy interest rates and have introduced a number of non-standard monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">At the same time, governments have adopted large fiscal stimulus measures, while also making vast public funds available to provide support to their banking and financial industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Recent data suggest that the massive response to the crisis by public authorities is bearing fruit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.21,0)">The threat of a continuing free fall in activity in our economies has now receded and there are signs that the global slowdown may be bottoming out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.91,0)">However, the crisis has certainly not come to an end: uncertainty remains high and the economic data remain volatile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Based on the information currently available, we expect the recovery to be gradual and, at least in the short term, to continue to rely on a number of temporary factors, such as past discretionary stimulus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Even though the crisis is not yet over, during the last year we have developed the set of principles and contingent courses of action that will govern the gradual and progressive exit from the set of non-standard measures currently in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Indeed, no orderly departure from the current set of policies can be achieved in the absence of a well-designed and clearly communicated exit framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Moreover, if current public policies are ultimately to be successful, the development of a credible exit strategy is almost as important as the nature and magnitude of the policies themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It goes without saying that discussing the appropriate design of an exit strategy should not necessarily be interpreted as signalling imminent policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I would like to structure my speech today around five specific questions related to the exit from the set of non-conventional monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">First, I would like to discuss “whence” we are exiting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For this purpose, I will briefly recall the main characteristics of the Eurosystem’s approach to non-conventional monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.24,0)">Then, I would like to elaborate on “why” we need to exit such policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I will then say a few words on “whither” we will exit, particularly as regards the monetary policy implementation framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I will then discuss “how” we are going to exit the set of measures currently in place and, finally, “when” we will do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.4,0)">Whence?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.81,0)">Following the intensification of the financial crisis in the autumn of 2008, inflationary pressures rapidly receded, prompting the ECB to undertake a series of aggressive cuts to its official policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.69,0)">Between October 2008 and May 2009, the ECB’s central policy rate – the interest rate on the main refinancing operations – was lowered by a cumulative 325 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The speed and extent of the monetary loosening experienced over this period are without precedent since the ECB took responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.03,0)">This is, of course, a rather short period, just over a decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">However, even if we look at the much longer historical experience of the national central banks forming the Eurosystem, such as the Deutsche Bundesbank, it is not possible to find anything similar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The severity of the economic contraction, with the ensuing downside risks for price stability, prompted the ECB to introduce additional measures that allowed it to ease monetary conditions above and beyond what could be achieved through the interest rate instrument alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Thus, the ECB adopted the comprehensive set of non-standard liquidity measures that together form what we call our “enhanced credit support” approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">The enhanced credit support programme relies on four key types of measures, which I would like to describe briefly: 1) Full accommodation of private banks’ demand for central bank liquidity at a fixed rate   and the conduct of additional longer-term refinancing operations  , in particular – and for the first time – six and twelve-month refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The outstanding amount of LTROs increased from €150 billion in June 2007 to over €600 billion at the end of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Over the same period the total amount of outstanding liquidity almost doubled, peaking at €850 billion on 2 January 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The 12- month operation conducted in June 2009 was, at EUR 442 billion euro, the largest single refinancing operation ever conducted by a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">It attracted the widespread participation of counterparties, namely 1,100 financial institutions, which may also have been a record.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">2) The regular provision of liquidity in foreign currencies, notably the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Since October 2008, these operations have been conducted with full allotment at a fixed rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Again, this is unprecedented in central banking history, and illustrates the close coordination and effective cooperation between major central banks over the last two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">3) The expansion of the list of assets eligible to be used as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In this respect, the Eurosystem was very different from other major central banks, as it entered the financial turmoil with a broad list of eligible collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">This also explains why a further extension of collateral eligibility was not required until October 2008, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.38,0)">after the collapse Lehman Brothers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In a financial crisis, the importance of the ample availability of eligible collateral accepted by central banks can hardly be overstated – after all, the most forthcoming of central bank refinancing operations can be used by counterparties only to the extent that they hold eligible collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">4) Outright purchases of covered bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.89,0)">The covered bond market, which has historically been an important source of funding for banks in large parts of the euro area, had suffered heavily from the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.8,0)">The total sum allocated to the purchase programme – €60 billion, representing about 5% of eligible outstanding covered bonds – may appear modest compared with the size of the portfolios of government and private sector securities built up by other central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">However, it reflects the ECB’s purpose to support market functioning and to act as a catalyst for this market rather than as a market-maker of last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">As is widely recognised, the goal of market reactivation has been achieved, and maybe even more rapidly then expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">During the first four months, the Eurosystem bought covered bonds for a total of over €20 billion, with the total of up to €60 billion being targeted for June 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">These measures were designed with the objective of providing support to the banking sector by:   helping the functioning of the money market,   easing funding conditions for banks, and   improving market liquidity in segments of the private debt securities market   that represent an important source of funding for euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Through these measures, the ECB aimed to mitigate the risk of systemic illiquidity in the euro banking sector and to guarantee a steady flow of banking credit to euro area households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is sometimes said that the secret of success for a policy stimulus is that it must be T-T-T: timely, temporary and targeted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.93,0)">Let me briefly elaborate on these three Ts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">It is generally recognised that since the start of the tensions, the ECB’s response to the crisis has been timely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Indeed, when widespread tensions threatened to bring the money market to a halt in early August 2007, the ECB reacted rapidly by injecting €95 billion in an overnight operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">After taking a number of additional measures in the course of the following year, the ECB again responded swiftly to the intensification of the crisis in October 2008, by announcing further exceptional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Similarly, the rapid and pronounced cuts in interest rates after October 2008 represented a timely response to the occurrence of large contractionary shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.83,0)">While repeatedly recalling its commitment to maintaining non-standard measures for as long as needed, the ECB has always stressed the temporary nature of its non-conventional policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The temporary character of these measures reflects their extraordinary nature and scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Indeed, the exceptionally disruptive effects of the crisis required equally exceptional policy responses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">However, measures that prove effective and appropriate in a crisis may not be needed when normal conditions are restored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Even more importantly, the temporary nature of the non-conventional measures is an important device to ensure the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Finally, the ECB’s liquidity measures were specifically targeted to the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">While in the course of the crisis some central banks have decided to bypass the banking system and lend directly to the real sectors of their economies, the Eurosystem has chosen to use the banking sector as an intermediary in order to support the euro area economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The reason for concentrating on the banking sector stems to a very large extent from structural features of the euro area economy, particularly the fact that its financial system is still predominantly bank-based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Indeed, bank loans account for a much larger share of financing to households and firms in the euro area than in the Anglo-Saxon countries, where non-bank financial institutions and capital markets provide alternative sources of funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">For instance, in 2007 the ratio of bank lending to the private sector to GDP amounted in the euro area to almost 150%, compared with 63% in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">By contrast, the ratio of outstanding debt securities issued by the euro area private sector relative to GDP was about 80% in the euro area, while it was more than twice as much in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The fact that the euro area financial system is predominantly bank-based implies that the health of the banking sector plays a major role in determining the orderly functioning of economic activity and the maintenance of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Thus, by easing funding conditions in the banking sector, the central bank can effectively pursue its target of guaranteeing steady access to credit for households and companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.25,0)">Moreover, disruptions to the inter-bank money market and to the banking system may have implications for the stability of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, potentially preventing the central bank from implementing its desired policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Following the implementation of the enhanced credit support framework, the size and complexity of the Eurosystem balance sheet has significantly increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In June 2007, just before the start of the crisis, total assets of the Eurosystem amounted to around 10% of area-wide GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">By January 2009, the size of the balance sheet had almost doubled, reaching 19% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Subsequent improvements in money market conditions have led to a reduction in the amount of total assets, but they remain at a higher level   than in the pre-crisis period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The expansion of the Eurosystem balance sheet was driven by changes in autonomous factors, as well as by the introduction of non-standard measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">It is difficult to assess the impact of our non-conventional policy precisely, but there are some clear signs that the measures are having positive effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.89,0)">In particular, the spreads between unsecured term interest rates and overnight interest rate swaps in the money market have declined significantly since last autumn and are now back at levels last seen before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.25,0)">Together with the policy rate cuts, this has contributed to a substantial decline in interest rates on loans to households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Also, banks have benefited from the tightening of spreads in the market for covered bonds, while issuance in the primary market has increased dramatically since the summer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">At the same time, we have to admit that growth in aggregate lending has not turned around.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Although there have been recent signs that the slowdown in lending to households has come to a halt, the growth rate of loans to non-financial corporations has continued to moderate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.31,0)">Indeed, loans to firms tend to lag GDP growth by about three quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">This may be related to the fact that non-financial corporations usually see their cash flows improve early in an economic upturn and thus tend to finance working capital and fixed investment with internal funds first, and only later with external financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.72,0)">In addition, when macroeconomic conditions are weak, the dynamics of bank loans are affected by demand-side factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.89,0)">Having said this, it is important to closely monitor developments in credit in order to assess to what extent supply-side constraints may play a role in limiting credit availability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.63,0)">Why?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">As I mentioned earlier, the exceptionally disruptive impact of the crisis has required extraordinary responses from public authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">However, as economic and financial conditions normalise, it is important to withdraw the currently exceptional degree of monetary accommodation, implemented through both historically low key policy rates and enhanced credit support measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.51,0)">Indeed, should a significant improvement in the outlook for economic activity not be accompanied by an adequate adjustment in the policy stance, the current monetary stance may become excessively accommodative, thereby giving rise to risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.4,0)">The experience of the past decade has led many economists to conclude that protracted accommodative monetary conditions, especially when they become widespread at the global level, may make access to credit in international financial systems too easy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.66,0)">Easy credit availability can in turn depress interest rates across the maturity spectrum and lead to severely distorted financial asset prices as agents engage in increasingly speculative behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.52,0)">Thus, preventing the monetary policy stance from becoming excessively accommodative is important not only to directly preserve price stability, but also to avoid the emergence of financial imbalances that may – if they prevail for too long – eventually give rise to episodes of macroeconomic instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Moreover, the long-term success of non-conventional policies depends on the policy-maker’s ability to pull off a difficult balancing act: to provide massive stimulus to the economy in the short-term, while keeping long-term private sector inflation expectations firmly anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.72,0)">The failure to preserve the anchoring of long-term inflation expectations would be self-defeating for non-conventional policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.43,0)">In such a case, the beneficial effects on the economy of the latter policies could be neutralised by an array of adverse factors, including increased inflation risk premia, interest rate volatility and Ricardian effects on consumer spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.34,0)">In addition to these considerations of a more macroeconomic character, there are other reasons - related to distortions in the functioning of markets and the behaviour of individual agents - why central banks should not retain non-standard liquidity measures once financial and market conditions render them unnecessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">First, the protracted provision of central bank liquidity may reduce the incentives for commercial banks to resume their market-based funding activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Indeed, as a result of the non-standard liquidity provision in euro and other currencies   during the crisis, the Eurosystem has significantly increased its involvement in financial intermediation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In fact, the Eurosystem effectively intermediates liquidity flows between banks in order to mitigate the effects of dysfunctional money markets on the funding liquidity of solvent banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">While justified by the severity of the crisis, this increased intermediation role is, of course, not fully consistent with the principles under which a market-oriented economy like the euro area should normally operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">Thus, with the return of the economic and financial preconditions for normal market functioning, incentives for interbank lending should be restored, so that banks can resume their core functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.59,0)">More generally, the protracted provision of central bank liquidity at favourable conditions may end up propping up banks that are unable to fulfil their funding needs, even under normal market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.47,0)">This may give rise to concerns about whether the necessary adjustments and restructuring in the banking system have taken place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Some considerations can also be made with regard to the collateral framework and to certain practices on collateral use that have emerged over the past two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">As mentioned earlier, the Eurosystem has always accepted a broad range of public and private securities, including unsecured bank bonds and asset-backed securities  , as collateral in its refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Having an extensive definition of eligible collateral has proven very useful during the crisis to mitigate refinancing risks for several classes of assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.49,0)">Indeed, in the course of the crisis counterparties have made active use of the refinancing opportunities provided by the Eurosystem’s refinancing operations and have deposited as collateral some eligible assets for which market liquidity had basically dried up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.68,0)">In particular, many ABS transactions have not been placed in the public market, but have been retained onto the balance sheet of the originator and/or privately placed to be used as collateral in central bank facilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">At the same time, banks have economised on the use of the most liquid categories of assets   in order to save them for private repo transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">As market conditions normalise, banks will need to make efforts to overcome the present large-scale use of self-originated ABS as collateral in Eurosystem credit operations, and instead place these securities with investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">This requires efforts to meet investor standards, in particular by improving the transparency, simplicity and the degree of standardisation of transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The Eurosystem is prepared to contribute as far as it can to the reactivation of the ABS markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The eligibility criteria and risk control measures of the Eurosystem’s collateral framework are an important tool in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Reactivating ABS markets would be, first of all, in the interest of banks as it would restore a major source of funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">It would also benefit the Eurosystem, as it would reduce the extra financial risks resulting from the inevitable links between counterparties and the self-originated ABS submitted as collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The ECB is aware of these risks, and has already mitigated them through a number of specific measures, such as the prohibition of some types of close links, the raising of the rating threshold for ABS, an increase in valuation haircuts and the phasing-out of multi-layer securitisations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Still, we consider that the reactivation of the ABS market and the associated reduction in the use of self-originated ABS would be ultimately the only way forward in this context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.91,0)">Whither?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.69,0)">Interest rates are currently at historically low levels, reflecting rapid and deep cuts between the autumn of 2008 and the spring of 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Once economic activity normalises and the outlook for price stability starts pointing to upward risks, adjustments in the stance of monetary policy in line with the maintenance of medium-term price stability are to be expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">While there is no doubt that the return to normality of our economies will need to be accompanied by a normalisation of monetary conditions, the key question is what we mean by “normal” in the post-crisis environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.58,0)">Indeed, there is significant empirical evidence showing that financial crises tend to have large and long-standing costs in terms of output and employment and tend to be followed by persistent declines in asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.05,0)">In the specific case of the current crisis, there are increasing concerns that its cost in terms of lost financial, physical and human capital all over the world may prove very substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.17,0)">As a result, the crisis may end up having a protracted impact on the rate of potential growth of a number of economies, including the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Therefore, in the post-crisis world, we may operate in an environment in which the dynamic properties of our economies are persistently affected, so that returning to “normality”, as we knew it before, will take a long time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.68,0)">As a side effect, the statistical regularities underlying the estimates of models and indicators   often used for policy analysis may not be as stable as in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.86,0)">At the ECB we have traditionally been reluctant to rely exclusively on models and summary indicators of the monetary policy stance, so we are not concerned about the reliability of any specific indicator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.22,0)">Yet, we share the more general concern that in the future decisions will be taken in an environment characterised by high uncertainty and reduced reliability of the monetary policy maker’s conventional information set.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Faced with increased uncertainty, central banks are at their best when they clearly commit to a well-defined goal and pursue it consistently and independently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In the case of the ECB, our strategy includes a specific quantitative definition of price stability: annual inflation of below, but close to, 2% in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This definition sets a clear benchmark against which decisions must be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Thus, in a period of increased uncertainty it is crucial for the ECB to set its interest rate instrument at any point in time at the level which is appropriate to ensure the achievement of its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">The assessment of the risks to medium-term price stability based on a comprehensive and robust set of indicators will prove essential in guiding monetary policy decisions in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In this respect, the ECB’s choice of a full-information approach resting on two complementary pillars  , with its advantages in terms of robustness is likely to prove very beneficial in providing insurance against increased model and paradigm uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Turning now to the monetary policy implementation framework, we should recall that prior to the escalation of the financial crisis in September 2008, the operational framework worked well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Hereafter, many exceptional measures were taken to support the availability of liquidity and the recovery of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Looking ahead, as conditions in the financial markets normalise further, not all these liquidity measures will be needed to the same extent as during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Therefore, one should envisage a situation in which the main operational features that were in place prior to the crisis are restored, while of course also bearing in mind the lessons learned from the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In particular, we seek to revert to a situation in which the one-week main refinancing operation is the main tool for steering money market rates and we act as “rate-takers” in the longer-term money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.97,0)">In addition, under normal circumstances, central banks also do not provide liquidity in foreign currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.55,0)">This does not mean, however, that contingency or emergency measures to be activated under extraordinary conditions cannot remain in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.42,0)">Finally, the use of using self-originated paper as central bank collateral should be considered as an anomaly under normal market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">How?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.58,0)">The stance of monetary policy, as reflected in short-term interbank interest rates, can obviously be tightened through an increase in key policy rates, or through a tighter liquidity supply, or through a combination of both.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.11,0)">It is too early at present to say which approach, or combination of approaches, should be followed, as it will depend on the circumstances prevailing at the relevant moment in time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.13,0)">With regard to the withdrawal of non-standard liquidity measures, it is useful to distinguish again between the main different types of measure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">First, for the non-standard refinancing operations, there is an obvious built-in mechanism that facilitates their removal, as the operations mature at pre-specified dates and can then be replaced by conventional refinancing operations, if needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Second, as with non-standard euro refinancing operations, the provision of foreign currency liquidity does not need to be renewed when it is considered that it is no longer warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.33,0)">In this context, let me remind you that the exit from this specific measure has already started: owing to lack of demand, we have already discontinued foreign currency-providing operations with longer maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.24,0)">Third, it has been made clear that the widening of the collateral framework is temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">More precisely, its remaining into effect is linked to the conduct of 12-month LTRO in December 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.23,0)">Hence, the widening of the collateral framework will be naturally phased out in December 2010, unless otherwise decided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.88,0)">Finally, in relation to the covered bond portfolio, there is no particular need to dispose of the purchased bonds at any future moment in time, as it does not interfere with monetary policy implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.21,0)">We could therefore decide to hold the portfolio until maturity and let it gradually shrink over time as a result of redemptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Alternatively, the portfolio could be disposed of in a gradual way that would make it possible to avoid market distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In any case, the alternative options can be considered again once the entire portfolio has been established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Regardless of the specific modalities adopted for the exit strategy, key principles of “how” to phase out existing measures should in any case be timeliness and gradualism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">Indeed, the stance of monetary policy should be normalised and the non-standard measures withdrawn in parallel with the gradual improvement in economic and financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Let me also stress that there are no technical obstacles to the implementation of our exit strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">In any case, we have the instruments to allow us to actively withdraw liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Longer-term liquidity-absorbing operations could be envisaged in a scenario where it is clear that the need to absorb persists for a certain period of time, and where a significant tightening in monetary policy is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">In this case, long-term liquidity absorption could be used to quickly restore a deficit situation along with an increase in interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">It may be recalled that many central banks worldwide constantly and successfully implement monetary policy through liquidity-absorbing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.27,0)">When?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In discussing when to exit non-conventional monetary policy, we may distinguish here between the traditional interest rate instrument and the multiple non-standard liquidity measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">For the stance of monetary policy, the answer to this question is simple – at least in theory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Given the institutional policy of the ECB, the obvious point in time to tighten the policy stance is when, based on the analysis of the outlook for economic activity and inflation, there is evidence of emerging upside risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">At that stage, the interest rate should be increased at the pace necessary to ensure price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.72,0)">However, identifying the right moment in time to start a tightening phase is difficult under normal conditions and even more so when the assessment of risks is, as in the current environment, surrounded by heightened uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.77,0)">Besides being technically difficult, identifying the exact moment when the balance of inflationary risks shifts could be complicated by the “noise” introduced by public utterances and pressures aimed at influencing the decision of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">At the ECB, we still have memories of the difficult environment we faced in 2005 when, after leaving the central policy rate unchanged at 2% for two and a half years, we decided to start tightening the policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">With hindsight, it is generally recognised that our decision was appropriate and that it served to anchor long-term inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">A past record of getting turning-points right is, however, no guarantee of success in the present context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.34,0)">Exceptionally high uncertainty implies that the exit from the current non-conventional monetary policy measures will need to be based on the analysis of a broader set of indicators than usual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.85,0)">Nevertheless, no matter how large the number and variety of indicators, one cannot exclude the risk of exiting from the non-conventional measures too soon or too late.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.48,0)">Both situations would be dangerous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.95,0)">If a central bank starts exiting prematurely, it will be hard for it to reverse its course, should a deterioration in economic conditions materialise again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Indeed, historical experience shows that there is a certain element of irreversibility in the removal of non-conventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.4,0)">This is because the effectiveness of non-conventional policy depends to a large extent on how long the policy is expected to stay in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">For instance, if an exceptional measure to increase liquidity supply to the banking sector is expected to be short-lived, banks are unlikely to extend additional credit to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.77,0)">More generally, even the appearance of a lack of commitment to its non-conventional measures   can prove self-defeating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.82,0)">It has been argued that, despite the announcement that the zero interest rate policy introduced in 1999 would be maintained until deflation was over, signs that the Bank of Japan was uncomfortable with this policy   prolonged the Japanese deflation unnecessarily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">At the same time, and here is the tricky issue, if the commitment is to be credible, it must also be realistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.93,0)">Indeed, unless severe deflationary pressures become deeply entrenched in expectations, the public may not believe that public authorities are seriously committed to pursuing non-conventional measures when these measures are of such a large magnitude as to appear untenable for the balance sheet of the central bank or for the sustainability of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.4,0)">So much for the risk of exiting too early.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.78,0)">There is also the opposite risk of exiting too late.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.95,0)">Exiting too late is dangerous because the public may lose faith in the central bank’s commitment to low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.91,0)">We know – from our own historical experience in the 1970s and early 1980s – that, once public sector inflation expectations have become destabilised, it is extremely difficult and costly   to bring them back under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">By contrast, a credible commitment to an explicit inflation objective helps to anchor inflation expectations to the desired level of inflation, and this anchoring contributes in itself to delivering price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">It is clear, then, that, as long as they remain well-anchored at the desired level, expectations can greatly facilitate the task of a central banker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.32,0)">A recent survey among market participants shows that only a small minority of respondents   are at present concerned about the implications of excess liquidity for future inflation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This, together with the fact that long-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored at levels consistent with price stability, suggests that market participants are confident in the ability of the ECB to withdraw its non-conventional measures at the right point in time and at the appropriate pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In this context, let me mention that, when assessing whether or not the non-conventional liquidity measures have achieved their objectives, we need to be aware that such measures have been introduced for systemic purposes and not to address problems at individual institutions, which fall within the sphere of competence of national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Therefore, concerns about the costs or difficulties faced by individual institutions, once the exceptional provision of liquidity is discontinued, should not act as a constraint on the timely implementation of an exit strategy from non-conventional monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">It should be recalled, though, that a necessary condition for central banks to be able to do their job of delivering price stability is the sustainability and credibility of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In the institutional set-up of European Monetary Union, this requires full compliance by national governments with the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, a fundamental component of the policy framework for area-wide macroeconomic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The fiscal costs of the crisis – stemming from discretionary stimulus measures, the use of automatic stabilisers and measures in support of the financial sector – are likely to be considerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.08,0)">These costs, together with the expected adverse fiscal impact of population ageing, pose considerable risks to future fiscal sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">In the aftermath of the crisis, many countries may not be able to rely on sustained GDP growth to smoothly reduce their debt burdens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">This means that ambitious plans for structural fiscal consolidation need to be developed and communicated in order to guarantee the public’s trust in the sustainability of public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.73,0)">Conclusions Over the past year our economies have undergone a period of severe financial crisis and major disruptions to economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.81,0)">While the full cost of the crisis has yet to be assessed, the magnitude of output and job losses experienced so far is considerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.49,0)">In order to contain the impact of the crisis on the real economy and preserve price stability, central banks have aggressively cut policy interest rates and introduced a number of exceptional liquidity measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Although the financial crisis is not yet over, we have carefully and thoughtfully developed the strategy that will govern the progressive exit from the set of non-standard measures currently in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">This should not be seen as a none-too-subtle signalling device about imminent policy actions, but rather as a demonstration of the central bank’s commitment to engineering a smooth and orderly departure from the current extraordinary and unprecedented policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Indeed, developing, communicating and eventually implementing in a timely manner a well-designed exit strategy is essential to preserve the contributions from the non-conventional policies to the maintenance of macroeconomic and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">I am grateful to John Beirne, Ulrich Bindseil, Alessandro Calza and Simone
