    <h2> Introductory Statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECON committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 24 September 2018 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)"> Hearing of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of the European Parliament Introductory Statement by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the ECON committee of the European Parliament, Brussels, 24 September 2018 Mr Chairman, Honourable members of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee, Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be back at the European Parliament before your Committee.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.07,0)">Ten years ago, the euro area entered a severe recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.48,0)">That crisis exposed structural weaknesses and forced us to address them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.13,0)">The work is not yet over, but we are reaping the benefits of our efforts: growth has been positive for more than five years, and the unemployment rate is at its lowest level since November 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In my remarks today, I will discuss the current economic environment and the role that the ECB’s monetary policy plays in it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">At the request of your Committee, I will also discuss central bank communication, which nowadays forms an integral part of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The euro area outlook The information that has become available since my last visit in July broadly confirms an ongoing broad-based expansion of the euro area economy, which grew by 0.4% in the second quarter of 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.5,0)">Despite some moderation following the strong growth performance in 2017, the economy continues to exhibit high levels of capacity utilisation, and labour markets are tightening with signs of labour shortages in some countries and sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.15,0)">This is reflected in the unemployment rate in the euro area, which stood at 8.2% in July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Since reaching a trough five years ago, euro area employment has increased by about 9.2 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">On account of the improving labour market and overall conditions, households’ disposable income in the euro area is currently growing at the highest rates observed in the last ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Higher income supports private consumption, which is expected to increase by 1.5% in 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">These factors, together with business investment being fostered by the favourable financing conditions, rising corporate profitability and solid demand, continue to support spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Looking ahead, the latest ECB staff macroeconomic projections confirm the outlook for continued broad-based growth of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.35,0)">Average annual growth is foreseen to be 2.0% in 2018, 1.8% in 2019 and 1.7% in 2020, with a slight downward revision for 2018 and 2019, mainly reflecting weaker global trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Risks surrounding the euro area outlook can still be viewed as broadly balanced, although the threat of protectionism, vulnerabilities in emerging markets and financial market volatility have become more prominent recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.91,0)">Fiscal policies in several euro area countries might be less neutral than we expected some time ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.56,0)">Regarding inflation developments, HICP inflation stood at 2.0% in August, down from 2.1% in July.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Headline inflation remains somewhat higher than in the first months of the year, reflecting the strong increase in oil prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Measures of underlying inflation remain generally muted but have been increasing from earlier lows as domestic price pressures are strengthening and broadening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Underlying inflation is expected to increase further over the coming months as the tightening labour market is pushing up wage growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">For example, annual growth in negotiated wages in the euro area increased from 1.5% in 2017 to 1.7% in the first quarter to 2018 and to 2.2% in the second quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This supports our confidence that the pick-up in wage growth will continue, as wage agreements often last two years or more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Looking forward, annual rates of HICP inflation are likely to hover around current levels in the coming months and are projected to reach 1.7% in each year between now and 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.32,0)">This stable profile conceals a slowing contribution from the non-core components of the general index, and a relatively vigorous pick-up in underlying inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Reflecting these dynamics, the ECB projections foresee inflation excluding food and energy reaching 1.8% in 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy and its effectiveness Overall, recent developments vindicate the Governing Council’s earlier assessments of the medium-term inflation outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Accordingly, at our last meeting the Governing Council decided to maintain the significant monetary policy stimulus in its present configuration and, in line with the conditional plan announced at our press conference in June in Riga, to reduce the monthly pace of net asset purchases to €15 billion from October until the end of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.5,0)">We anticipate that, subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, we will then end net purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This doesn't mean that our monetary policy will cease to be accommodative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">For our baseline expectations of a rising inflation path to materialise, we need to remain patient, prudent and persistent in calibrating the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">In line with this approach, we will continue to provide substantial monetary stimulus by combining three policy measures: first, our enhanced forward guidance on the key ECB interest rates, which we expect to remain at present levels at least through the summer next year, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued convergence of inflation towards our aim; second, the residual net asset purchases that we will be conducting until the end of this year; and third, the reinvestment of the sizeable stock of acquired securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Our monetary policy measures have made a very substantial contribution to the positive economic developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.08,0)">If we consider all the policy measures taken since mid-2014, our staff estimates show that the overall impact on euro area real GDP growth and euro area inflation is – in both cases – around 1.9 percentage points cumulatively between 2016 and 2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Importance of central bank communication Let me now turn to the topic of central bank communication that you suggested for today’s meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Regarding this topic, forward guidance has indeed become an important instrument for all major central banks as conventional monetary tools have reached their effective lower bound, and the ECB is no exception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Forward guidance on our policy interest rates has evolved considerably over time, since we first introduced it in July 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Roughly speaking, it has gone through three phases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">When we first gave forward guidance in 2013, our goal was to insulate euro area financing conditions, and especially the near-term segment of the term structure of money market interest rates, from the heightened volatility emanating from the US money market as a result of the “taper tantrum” episode of May-June 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">During the second phase, our forward guidance served to reinforce the effectiveness of the net asset purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">By expressing the Governing Council’s expectations about the likely future path of interest rates, we ensured that the downward impact that the asset purchases were exerting on longer-term yields was not counteracted by unanchored market expectations of short-term interest rate increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.53,0)">Since June 2018 we have expressed our expectation that, subject to incoming data confirming our medium-term inflation outlook, net purchases will likely end after December 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">As we had for some time tied the horizon for our rate path to the end of our net purchases – giving indications that interest rates will remain at their present levels “well past the end of our net purchases” – announcing a conditional plan for terminating net purchases by a certain date made it necessary for us to re-anchor the rate guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Steering expectations of the policy rate path was critical because the path of inflation that the Governing Council viewed as moving closer to the objective of a sustained adjustment was – and still is – conditional on a term structure of interest rates that embodies expectations of constant policy rates over an extended period of time after December 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">It was important for us to retain firm control over the signalling implicit in our monetary policy announcements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">At that critical juncture, we had to reassure investors and the public that the likely change in the course of our asset purchases will not stymie the recovery and frustrate progress toward inflation normalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">With this in mind, in June 2018 we said that we expected interest rates to remain at their present levels “at least through the summer of 2019, and in any case for as long as necessary to ensure that the evolution of inflation remains aligned with our current expectations of a sustained adjustment path”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This rate guidance, which we reasserted back in July and also this month, actually contains two parts: first, the “through the summer of 2019” formulation is a calendar-based element, which refers to when we anticipate conditions that might warrant a first rate increase; and second, a state-dependent component, indicating our expectation that rates will remain unchanged in any case for as long as necessary to ensure the continued sustained convergence of inflation to levels that are below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">As it turned out, the realignment of market expectations with those of the Governing Council was immediate and smooth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The new formulation has helped market participants to better understand our reaction function and adjust the outlook on which they base their plans accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Of course, steering financing conditions – by guiding the expectations of market professionals – is only part of our task.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">We are responsible for ensuring price stability for the 340 million people of the euro area who use the euro and make economic decisions every day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Reaching out to citizens is the key to maintaining public confidence in their central bank, and in the appropriateness and efficacy of its policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In this respect, hearings before the European Parliament are a fundamental – absolutely fundamental – channel through which we can explain to the people of Europe the reasons for our decisions and how those decisions impact their lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The ECB and the European Parliament, building on the framework enshrined in primary law, have responded to the demand for stronger scrutiny that arose during the crisis and have ensured a high degree of accountability throughout it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Nevertheless, this should be no reason for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">We are well aware that maintaining people’s trust in the ECB calls for tireless efforts on our side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Facing challenging times, we have sought to enhance understanding of our decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.73,0)">For instance, since January 2015 the ECB has been publishing regular accounts of the Governing Council’s monetary policy discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">As the exchanges and conversations we have in this room testify, this additional set of information enables you – and anyone who is interested in the conduct of monetary policy – to enhance scrutiny of the ECB’s policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">At the same time, this has provided us with greater opportunities to explain our decisions and demonstrate that we are acting in accordance with our democratic mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Over the past few years, we have also stepped up our efforts to overcome the key communication challenges posed by the euro area structure, namely reaching out to citizens in 19 countries, who naturally have different expectations regarding the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">We have thus enhanced our communication strategy, directly addressing a wider range of audiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In addition to our institutional activities, my fellow Executive Board members and I have participated in about 180 events over the last two years, a quarter of them in centres of education.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">If I include think tanks, foundations, non-profit organisations and governmental bodies, we delivered more speeches to these fora than at the ECB and the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">ECB staff members have complemented these efforts with a dedicated outreach programme aimed specifically at secondary schools and universities which goes into the functions and purpose of a central bank in an advanced economy, and also explains the financial crisis and the ECB’s role in alleviating its effects on the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">We have covered similar ground in our expanded website, which now features videos, explainers and charts that describe complex issues in an accessible way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">We have started using new tools, such as YouTube and LinkedIn, as well as Twitter, where we have almost 440,000 followers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Conclusions The European Parliament, which represents EU citizens, is the key to fostering people’s understanding of and trust in ECB decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In this sense, it contributes to the effectiveness of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But your contribution, as parliamentarians, does not end here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">You, as co-legislators, have a role to play in making sure that Europe is well prepared if the risks I mentioned in my introduction were to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">We have seen that, far from damaging growth, a strong regulatory framework is essential in ensuring strong long-term economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Today, ten years since the start of the financial crisis, there is still important unfinished business when it comes to improving the EU financial legislative framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">As we are approaching the end of this legislative term, we need to seize the opportunity now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">I thus count on the Parliament’s support to make sure that the framework provides the necessary stability to the markets, thus protecting EU citizens, as customers, workers and taxpayers.</span>
