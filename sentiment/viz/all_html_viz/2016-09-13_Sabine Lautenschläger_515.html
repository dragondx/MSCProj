    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.78,0)"> Monetary policy in uncertain times – the ECB and the crisis Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Parliamentary evening in Strasbourg, 13 September 2016 All beginnings are difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It’s true of monetary policy as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let’s consider for a moment Europe’s first central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.86,0)">In 1656 Johan Palmstruch founded Stockholm Banco, introduced paper money and triggered an economic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.26,0)">What happened?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">At the outset Stockholm Banco conducted normal banking operations: it took deposits and made loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.12,0)">The deposits at that time mainly consisted of copper coins, and the most common denomination weighed almost 20 kg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But in 1662 the Swedish state issued new coins which contained less copper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The old coins stored at Stockholm Banco thus became more valuable and the depositors asked for them back.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.63,0)">The bank then found itself with a serious liquidity problem because the desired coins had been issued as loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.61,0)">Faced with this situation, Johan Palmstruch had an idea – an idea with consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.14,0)">Those who asked for their coins back received paper money instead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.35,0)">This paper money was backed by the copper coins, which had not disappeared but had simply been lent out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The people and the state accepted the paper money; the crisis was averted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">At the same time, Stockholm Banco could now make loans in the form of paper money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It then did that, but somewhat too generously: it produced more paper money than were backed by the coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.02,0)">The people lost trust in the value of the paper money and Sweden experienced inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.48,0)">To control it, Stockholm Banco stopped issuing loans and paper money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.0,0)">This in turn led to an economic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.52,0)">In 1667 the Swedish state shut down Europe’s first central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">In the 350 years since, we have gained theoretical knowledge and practical experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.17,0)">Today any first-year economics undergraduate could warn Stockholm Banco about the dangers of its policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">While monetary policy was more art than science in the early days, now it is more science than art.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.49,0)">But all that experience and all that knowledge cannot prevent monetary policymakers even now suddenly finding themselves in difficult terrain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">For it’s not only monetary policy that has a major influence on economic growth and other important factors for the central bank, but also businesses, banks and other market participants as well as governments; thus, they too influence price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.96,0)">Uncertain times Looking back over the recent past, we see a decade of crisis and uncertainty; we see a whole series of “black swans” – events that could not be foreseen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.49,0)">We see how the insolvency of an American investment bank triggered a global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.13,0)">We see a global economic crisis, a European sovereign debt crisis and we see how the people of the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.17,0)">Brexit was an event that few people had reckoned with, surely; an event that has heightened economic uncertainty and that may damage the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Although it is still too early to draw any definitive conclusions about the effects of Brexit on the economy, our current forecasts are incidentally offering an encouraging picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The impact seems to be smaller than many had feared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But it is in everyone’s interest to pass through this phase of political uncertainty as soon as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.37,0)">Crises now seem to have become part of everyday life and the improbable has become the norm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In such times of uncertainty monetary policy serves as an important anchor of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.29,0)">However, the crises of the last few years have also pushed monetary policy into uncharted territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">To achieve the goal of stable prices, it has followed new paths.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Monetary policy in uncertain times – finding new ways to the old goal The journey started in a way that is far from new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.77,0)">Following the failure of Lehman Brothers in autumn 2008, banks found themselves to be objects of deep mistrust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.25,0)">They could hardly assess their own risks, let alone the risks of other banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.11,0)">As a result, they stopped lending to each other and even solvent banks could no longer refinance themselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">At this point, the ECB jumped in and became the lender of last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Basically, this is not a new role for a central bank, but one of its original tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.48,0)">It goes back to 1873 and Walter Bagehot, who wrote that “to stem a financial panic,   the central bank should lend freely at a penalty rate to solvent institutions against good collateral”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The ECB has done that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">It has offered the banks unlimited liquidity and extended the maturities of the relevant loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">At the same time, it has expanded the list of eligible collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">As a lender of last resort the ECB managed to help the banking system get through the first phase of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.17,0)">When the crisis started, the ECB also reduced interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Initially, this wasn’t a new path either, but standard practice for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The lower interest rates are, the more attractive it is for companies to invest and for people to consume.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Demand goes up and so do prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.86,0)">The ECB entered unfamiliar territory in June 2014 when it reduced the deposit rate for banks to below a level previously regarded as a barrier: the “zero lower bound”, as it is called.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.01,0)">A slow economic recovery and persistently low inflation had made that necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.24,0)">Banks are therefore now having to pay interest on their deposits at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.16,0)">It may seem strange to many people to have to pay someone you’re lending money to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">And that’s exactly what it’s all about: the individual bank should have an incentive to lend its money elsewhere, for example to companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.12,0)">This is one effect of negative interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.47,0)">The second effect concerns investors’ expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.2,0)">They now know that short-term interest rates can fall below zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.65,0)">Knowing this, they adjust downwards their interest rate expectations for the future and long-term interest rates fall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This boosts the desired effect on investment and consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">However, it is precisely these negative rates that have triggered a lively debate in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.37,0)">There is much talk of “penalty rates” which are hurting savers and thus undermining monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I can make four comments on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.46,0)">In the first place, the ECB does not set interest rates in an arbitrary fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.6,0)">Interest rates always reflect the economic situation – and that is influenced by things other than monetary policy, by labour market policy, tax policy and fiscal policy, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.87,0)">Raising interest rates in the current situation would benefit nobody, ultimately not even savers or banks: the recovery in Europe would slow down, unemployment would rise and inflation would fall further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.46,0)">This would not only worsen the banks’ situation, but also increase the risk of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The second point applies to savers: a 3% interest rate with 3% inflation is exactly the same as a 0% interest rate with 0% inflation, although for many people it might feel different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.0,0)">It’s what remains at the end that matters, and that is the real interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.5,0)">The real interest rate is that part of the interest rate which is not absorbed by inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">And if we look at real interest rates, the current situation is not that unusual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.61,0)">Real interest rates in Germany between 1974 and 1981 and between 1989 and 1994 were almost always negative – it just felt different because the interest rates on paper were positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.39,0)">Third, savers are naturally not very enthusiastic about the return on their savings – I feel the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">However, we shouldn’t overlook all those who should be pleased to have very low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Anyone who takes out a loan to build a house or to invest in a business idea benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">With rising interest rates the opposite would be true – savers would gain and borrowers would bear the burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.25,0)">Currently, the overall effect is neutral: the average net interest income of households in the euro area has not changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.85,0)">Fourth, in fact, not only savers, but also banks are affected by the low interest rates – their interest income is coming under pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.24,0)">It is argued that this effect could ultimately undermine the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.65,0)">When the income accruing to banks falls too sharply, they could have no alternative but to issue fewer loans or demand higher interest rates on loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.12,0)">That would be the opposite of what monetary policy is trying to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.42,0)">This brings us to the absolute lower limit for interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.7,0)">This limit is reached once the desired effect of the negative rates goes into reverse – either because lending suffers or because banks and individuals start to hoard cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.29,0)">But we don’t seem to have reached the absolute lower limit yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Since mid-2014, borrowing conditions for businesses and households have improved, and loan growth is recovering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At the same time, the money supply is showing no signs of cash hoarding by individuals or banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.61,0)">But should we feel obliged to cut interest rates even more, just because the absolute lower limit has not been reached?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.27,0)">I don’t think so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Conditions on the financial markets have significantly improved and economic growth is back on track – the slight effect of Brexit shows how robust the recovery is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.73,0)">Against this background I have my doubts about the benefits of further interest rate cuts – especially when we compare the benefits with the costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.69,0)">Negative interest rates have both a desired effect and undesired side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.84,0)">These include not only the burden on savers, banks and insurance companies but also the risk of reducing the pressure to reform on policymakers as well as the risk of creating asset price bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Such measures should only be taken as and when it is really necessary and the cost-benefit analysis is still positive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">To sum up, despite these risks and side effects I still consider negative rates to be justified at the moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.3,0)">But going beyond that I’m sceptical about further interest rate reductions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.46,0)">The ECB has been stepping into unfamiliar territory with another instrument – how have things been going in that respect?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">When, in the second half of 2014, the medium-term outlook for the economy worsened and inflation expectations fell back, the Governing Council of the ECB decided to purchase bonds – initially government bonds and then also corporate bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">This programme is intended to support the other measures by additionally lowering long-term interest rates via various channels and at the same time it gives a signal that monetary policy is committed to its goal of stable prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">What we are already seeing is that the bond purchases have helped to further improve borrowing conditions for businesses and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.16,0)">It is however too early to analyse statistically the unfolding effects on growth and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">But analyses based on theoretical models have shown that the programme may have an effect – even though the degree of effectiveness is uncertain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">But here too it’s true that strong medicine has side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.49,0)">Particularly in Germany many people are understandably worried that the side effects could be greater than the intended effects, especially over the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.45,0)">The critics of the purchase programme are saying that it distorts debt markets, reduces the pressure on governments to reform, blurs the boundary between monetary policy and government financing, and threaten financial stability in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">As I said, we will therefore need to be patient for a while before being able to make a final assessment of the purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">What matters now is to give the measures time to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.83,0)">That’s why I see no reason at the moment to change the key design elements of the purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.99,0)">Concluding remarks Ladies and gentlemen, the crises of the past few years have thrust monetary policy into unknown territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.03,0)">But we are far from the times of Banco Stockholm, when there was no clear objective for monetary policy, no theoretical basis and no experience of such matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Yes, the crisis has pushed monetary policy into uncharted territory, but we have a clear objective and we know where we are thanks to theory and experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">However, in recent years we have done a lot for the first time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The key question is whether our package of measures works – and it’s only as a package that the effect can be assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Have we come nearer to our objective of bringing inflation back to a stable level of close to, but below, 2%?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">What we are seeing is that conditions on the financial markets are improving – I mentioned that earlier with regard to the individual measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">And when the conditions on the financial markets improve, the ground is prepared for a return to higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">So monetary policy is working.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">We are approaching our goal, albeit by following new paths.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But we must not overlook two things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.84,0)">First, the individual measures cannot be continued indefinitely – at some point, for example, interest rates will hit their absolute lower limit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.69,0)">Second, the measures cannot be continued indefinitely – at some point the effect of the measures will get weaker and the risks will predominate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In my view instead of new and always more extreme measures we need a little patience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">We should not forget that returning inflation to just under 2% is a medium-term goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.0,0)">Our current projections see inflation in 2018 back at 1.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, price stability is a necessary condition for growth and prosperity, and the ECB is doing everything to ensure it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.39,0)">But monetary policy alone cannot build factories or create jobs or balance national budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It can only create the right conditions for these things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Ultimately, it’s up to governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">They have to complete the necessary economic reforms, strengthen the institutional foundation of Economic and Monetary Union and bring these times of uncertainty to an end.</span>
