    <span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)"> Opening remarks to the press briefing: Presentation of indicators of financial integration in the euro area Speech by Lucas Papademos, Vice President of the ECB,Frankfurt am Main, 30 September 2005 Ladies and Gentlemen, Welcome to the European Central Bank and thank you for attending this press briefing on “Indicators of financial integration in the euro area”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We will start with some introductory remarks from my side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">My colleague on the ECB’s Executive Board Ms Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell will then present the indicators of financial integration in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">With us on the podium are the Director General Statistics, Mr Steven Keuning, and the Deputy Director General Economics, Mr Philippe Moutot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">All of us will be available to answer any questions that you might have regarding this publication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">The publication of the indicators for financial integration in the euro area is a first for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">For this reason, and also in order to underscore the importance which the ECB attaches to European financial integration and to highlight the particular informative value of these indicators, we considered it appropriate to mark the publication of this report by inviting you to this event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me begin by addressing some fundamental questions which might be asked in this context: Why did the ECB decide to produce such a set of indicators?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.94,0)">What is the purpose of this publication?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">The ECB seeks to foster further integration in European financial markets in various ways and through a number of initiatives for the following reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">First, financial integration is important for the smooth and effective implementation of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">It also facilitates and speeds up the transmission of the effects of monetary policy on the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Moreover, a financial system with well-developed capital markets, being intrinsically forward-looking, can provide us with useful and timely information about future economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Second, financial integration has implications for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">As you are certainly aware, the Treaty  ) calls upon the Eurosystem to contribute “to the smooth conduct of policies pursued by the competent authorities relating to the prudential supervision of credit institutions and the stability of the financial system”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">To this end, an understanding of the links between financial integration and financial stability, and, in particular, of the implications of financial integration for financial stability is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">On the one hand, deeper and more integrated financial markets offer better opportunities for financing and risk diversification, and thus also help to improve the capacity of the economies to absorb shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">On the other hand, intensified cross-border financial links also harbour the potential that shocks could be transmitted more rapidly through the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.46,0)">A potentially increased risk of financial contagion alters the challenges to financial stability that we are facing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Against this background, the monitoring of progress towards more fully integrated markets – as we are seeking to do with this new set of indicators – is useful for our assessment of the outlook for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Finally, and more generally, financial integration can help to promote the development and modernisation of financial markets, institutions and infrastructures, thereby helping, through various channels, to support economic activity and raise the potential for economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Deeper and wider markets encourage savings, offer more and better investment opportunities, reduce the cost of capital and intermediation, and facilitate a more efficient allocation of financial resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">In this way, they contribute to higher growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">It is for this reason that the objective of fostering financial integration in the European Union is a key aspect of the Lisbon agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In fact, financial integration has arguably been one of the most successful components of the Lisbon strategy and further progress towards more integrated financial markets is undoubtedly desirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The ECB has taken a proactive stance towards, and has been involved in several initiatives aimed at fostering, financial integration, given its importance not only for the performance of the basic tasks of the Eurosystem but also for the welfare of European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">It goes without saying that we are also in close cooperation with the European Commission in our efforts to promote financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The pertinent initiatives of both institutions support and complement each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Regarding the specific fields of activity and expertise of the ECB and the Eurosystem, we distinguish between four kinds of contribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">First, public authorities can make a contribution by fostering collective action to overcome possible coordination problems in the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Right from the start of Monetary Union, the ECB has sought to play this “catalyst role”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The most recent example in this respect is our support of the initiative for a Single Euro Payments Area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">Second, we provide central banking services that are conducive to financial integration, most prominently by operating Europe’s leading large-value cross-border payment system, TARGET.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Third, we offer advice on the legal and regulatory frameworks for the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">For example, the Eurosystem recently commented on the review of the Lamfalussy process  and on the European Commission’s priorities for financial services policy over the next five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Finally, the ECB also seeks to provide economic analysis and research on financial integration, in order to raise the awareness of economic agents and policy-makers about the benefits of financial integration for the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">The ECB is in a unique position to produce in-depth economic analysis and comprehensive statistics for the euro area as a whole, by drawing on the expertise of its staff, by relying on direct interaction with major financial players and by building on its role as a supranational institution at the helm of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The publication we are presenting today belongs to this fourth type of initiative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.9,0)">In discussions on European financial integration, the relevant arguments are often of a qualitative nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">However, in order to properly monitor and assess the state of financial integration, quantitative information in the form of indicators – as contained in our report – is not only useful, but essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">We wanted to devise a way in which to capture, in quantitative terms, the various dimensions of financial integration and to have a toolbox at our disposal to monitor developments, measure progress and assess the state of integration of the different components of the European financial system, that is, financial markets, financial institutions and financial infrastructures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The indicators that we have compiled focus on markets and cover the main financial market segments of the euro area, ranging from the money market to retail loans and wholesale equity trading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The statistics indicate that the degree of integration varies greatly depending on the market segment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The unsecured money market has been fully integrated since shortly after the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The repo market is also highly integrated, albeit to a lesser extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Government bond markets have integrated significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The indicators for the corporate bond market, which has grown considerably since the introduction of the single currency, also point to a high degree of integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Progress has also been made in the integration of euro area equity markets, in which equity returns are increasingly determined by common factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.33,0)">However, banking markets are generally much less integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">These general findings – and I only wanted to refer to them very briefly – already demonstrate that the indicators contained in the report will contribute to enriching the discussion on the progress of financial integration with tangible evidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I would now like to give the floor to Ms Tumpel-Gugerell, who will present in greater detail these new indicators and the report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Thank you very much for your attention.</span><span style="background-color:
