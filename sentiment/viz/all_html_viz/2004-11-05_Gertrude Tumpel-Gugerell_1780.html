    <span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)"> Six Years after the Euro: Success and Challenges Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBAnnual Conference of the Association of Private Client Investment Managers and Stockbrokers  , Paris, 5 November 2004 Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, It is a great pleasure for me to be with you here in Paris today and to share some thoughts on the European Monetary Union with such a distinguished attendance gathered at this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">I believe that after almost six years with the euro, it useful to look back at the experiences we have made and also to look ahead towards the new challenges facing us on the horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">These challenges will remind us central bankers that we need to adapt not only to the normal fluctuations of the economy, but also to a number of more fundamental structural changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This is perhaps particularly true for central bankers responsible for the conduct of monetary policy in the changing environment of a monetary union that is likely to grow in the not-so-distant future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">The historic expansion of the European Union earlier this year highlighted that the European project is a dynamic process, and that it, from time to time, will bring about great changes to the framework in which we operate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Conditions for successful currency unions I would like to start my talk here today by discussing the monetary union and a number of conditions that are necessary for a successful currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">While the implementation of EMU certainly was a giant undertaking and a unique project, I think that one should remember that the concept of a currency union is not a new idea.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.77,0)">In fact, one can go back all the way to the Roman Empire, or the Quin and Han dynasties of China around 200 B.C.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">to 200 A.D., to find early examples of universal currencies being introduced, although the institutional framework arguably was different from the one in today’s euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">A number of more modern examples exist, some successful, some less so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">As you know, in the case of EMU, the Maastricht Treaty of 1992 specified a number of convergence criteria that Member States needed to meet before entering into the monetary union, in order to ensure a successful monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">These criteria, which included convergence towards price stability, sound public finances, exchange rate stability and low and stable long-term interest rates, are still in place for future applicants to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Setting aside the specific case of EMU for a minute, what can we say in general about the conditions necessary for a successful implementation of a monetary union?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">A key ingredient is that the political will to go through with the project exists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Moreover, once implemented, a common currency area requires a single monetary policy and a common central bank, as demonstrated by historical examples of failed currency unions in the absence of these ingredients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">With respect to economic criteria, I would like to stress the need for flexibility in labour, product, and capital markets as important ingredients for a successful currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">In addition, mechanisms for effectively dealing with asymmetric shocks should be present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.34,0)">Finally, let me mention one further condition, which to my mind, sometimes does not receive the attention it merits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">This is the need for a sufficient degree of cohesion among the societies participating in the currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.83,0)">Without common values and shared goals, the construction of a stable and successful monetary union will always be a difficult undertaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.49,0)">Early on during the build-up of EMU, as you may recall, a great deal of scepticism towards the idea of a common European currency surfaced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.96,0)">This was often related to criticism that Europe did not satisfy the conditions for a successful currency union I just mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.99,0)">Specifically, some argued that Europe could not be considered an optimum currency area, and that a “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy will lead to imbalances as a result of asymmetric shocks and a low degree of factor mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.3,0)">Critics also claimed that the EU did not have sufficient mechanisms in place to deal with asymmetric shocks through fiscal transfers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.05,0)">Some doubted the political determination to realise the entire project, while other sceptics argued that the nations in Europe did not share similar goals, and that a monetary union therefore inevitably would result in disagreement and conflict.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.64,0)">The experience of the past six years Looking back at the experience over the past six years with the euro, I am inclined to say that the sceptics were wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">As we all know, the euro was successfully introduced on 1 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">At the same time, a completely new monetary policy framework was introduced, with the European Central Bank in charge of a single, stability-oriented monetary policy for the entire euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This, in combination with the convergence of general economic policies that took place during the run-up to the introduction of the euro, provided an environment supportive of greater macroeconomic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Another important result of monetary unification was the improved resilience against crises in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Without a common currency, I am convinced that a number of countries – in particular some of the smaller ones – would have experienced more pronounced adverse effects in times of turbulent market conditions, than was the case in the last six years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">One of the most profound economic changes in Europe over the past few years has been the deepening integration of financial markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">This has been the result both of the elimination of intra-area exchange rate risk, and of private and public initiatives to foster financial integration through harmonised regulations and institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This has led to enhanced breadth and efficiency of European financial markets, which in turn is conducive to a more efficient allocation of capital, and ultimately supportive of greater potential growth in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Before turning to economic developments during the last six years in some more detail, let me point out a few other observations related to the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">One is the, perhaps obvious, observation that the euro has been established as a major international currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">After the U.S. dollar, the euro is the second-most widely used currency in the world, both as a reserve currency as well as an investment and transaction currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This can be seen as a sign of markets’ confidence in the euro as a stable and trusted currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Moreover, the euro area as a whole, rather than its individual countries, is now considered by the rest of the world when international macroeconomic issues are discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">No account of developments in the euro area would be complete without mentioning the introduction of euro notes and coins on 1 January 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The logistics of this cash changeover for over 300 million European citizens represented a tremendous challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Thanks to the careful preparations of the ECB, the national central banks, financial institutions, and individual firms, the changeover went remarkably smoothly, and the new physical currency was immediately accepted by the citizens of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">I would now like to return to the experiences we have had with the euro during the last six years, from an economic viewpoint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Since it is the responsibility of the ECB to safeguard the value of the euro, I will begin by discussing developments primarily in the internal value of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, I will also briefly touch upon the exchange rate developments in the first years of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.35,0)">As you know, the ECB defines price stability as an annual inflation rate for the euro area below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">In a clarification of the monetary policy strategy last year, the ECB announced that it would aim to maintain inflation rates close to 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.88,0)">Looking back at the period since the introduction of the euro, the average inflation rate in the euro area has been exactly 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.74,0)">Occasionally, the inflation rate has moved above the 2% ceiling as a result of temporary shocks, for example the recent sharp rise in the price of oil products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">However, when such shocks occur, what is important is that price stability is maintained over the medium term, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">once the shock has abated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">This medium-term orientation is aimed at preserving monetary policy from short-termism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.47,0)">Without such an orientation, a central bank risks being overwhelmed by the latest economic news, indicators, and shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.22,0)">Monetary policy then runs the risk of gradually steering away from its foremost role of providing a firm medium-term anchor for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In this context, it is interesting to note that long-term inflation expectations   have never exceeded 2% since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.85,0)">Another aspect of euro area price developments concerns the dispersion of inflation rates across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.31,0)">As you may recall, one of the criticisms against EMU was that a “one-size-fits-all” monetary policy would lead to imbalances, such as highly disparate inflation rates, with a resulting loss of competitiveness and higher unemployment in some areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">A closer look at the dispersion of inflation rates among euro area member states reveals that the convergence programmes in place prior to the introduction of the euro significantly reduced inflation differences among individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.21,0)">In some cases, remaining inflation differences may have an economic explanation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The Balassa-Samuelson effect, for example, leads to slightly higher inflation rates in countries that are in a catch-up phase compared to countries with the highest living standards in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.73,0)">Such effects notwithstanding, a comparison with inflation dispersion in the U.S.   shows that since 1999, inflation dispersion in the euro area has been persistently close to the low levels seen in the U.S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This low degree of inflation dispersion in the euro area has been established without having had the benefit of centuries of experience, as in the U.S. case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Taken together, the evidence points to a relatively successful six-year period with respect to euro area price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">What about the role of monetary policy in promoting economic growth in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">First of all, one needs to recognise that price stability is a necessary condition for sustainable growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The ECB is called upon to deliver price stability and to maintain credibility in delivering price stability over the medium and long term, which in turn contributes to maximising sustainable growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Hence, by contrast with what is sometimes heard from critics of the ECB, maintaining price stability and promoting economic growth are not two contradictory goals, but they should rather be seen as complementary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">So far, monetary policy in the euro area has been successful in maintaining stable prices, and it has therefore provided the best possible contribution it can make to sustained growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.89,0)">Looking at the present situation, the level of interest rates in the euro area is very low by historical standards, in both nominal and real terms, and interest rates have been low for a protracted period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">This low level of interest rates is of course supportive of the economic recovery in the euro area, while at the same time being consistent with price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.62,0)">However, related to what I said earlier regarding inflationary shocks, the surge in oil prices has already had a direct visible impact on inflation rates in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In this environment, there is a strong need for vigilance with respect to all developments which could imply risks to price stability over the medium term, including the possibility that the oil price increases will have second-round effects on consumer prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.35,0)">Returning to our experiences during the past six years, one common criticism against the monetary union during the initial period after the introduction of the euro related to what was perceived as a deep and protracted slide in the value of the euro relative to other currencies, and in particular relative to the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.1,0)">During the last two years, this trend has been fully reversed, leading instead to some concerns about the degree of volatility in foreign exchange markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">While excessive volatility certainly is not beneficial, it may be useful to view developments in the euro’s exchange rate in a longer-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Looking at developments over the past 25 years, we see that the swings we have witnessed in the euro exchange rate during the past six years are not extraordinary compared to synthetic measures of the EUR/USD exchange rate, or the real effective exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Hence, while we can debate whether the volatility in foreign exchange markets reflects fundamentals in a reasonable way, I would at least contend that the fluctuations of the euro exchange rate during the past six years have not been exceptional.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">As I already mentioned, some of the most important economic changes in Europe in recent years have taken place in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The introduction of the euro promoted further financial market integration, although the integration process started earlier in many market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Linked to this, the depth and breadth of markets has increased, as the elimination of exchange rate risk and the removal of intra-area currency matching rules has allowed many more investors to access the various markets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">In addition, intra-area exchange rate risk premia have disappeared, which, in combination with reduced premia linked to the increased emphasis on stability-oriented economic policies, has significantly reduced financing costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.42,0)">Ten-year euro area government bond yields, for example, have remained at historically low levels, on average below 5%, since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Another important development in euro area financial markets during the last six years has been the rapid growth of new market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The euro-denominated corporate bond market, for example, grew from less than 400 billion EUR of outstanding bonds in 1998 to well over one trillion EUR this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Moreover, apart from this impressive growth in the market as a whole, completely new market segments saw the light of day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">In particular, the high-yield segment of the euro area corporate bond market grew from virtually non-existent to a significant portion of the market over the last six years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">All in all, monetary unification seems to have been highly beneficial for euro area financial markets, although further improvements with respect to depth, liquidity and the degree of integration can still be made, at least for some segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Questions and challenges for the future The euro area faces important questions for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">How can the dynamism of the European economy be improved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">How can productivity be improved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">What can we do to boost growth and employment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">How can trade be stimulated further?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The answers to these questions will prove important in determining the long-term success of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">A look at the economic performance of the euro area during the past six years highlights some of the challenges facing Europe in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">For example, while trade both within the euro area and with partners outside the area increased immediately after the introduction of the euro, some had hoped for an even more pronounced and persistent effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.92,0)">As for economic growth, real GDP growth in the euro area picked up markedly shortly after the introduction of the euro, but the performance thereafter has been relatively disappointing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.45,0)">Perhaps the greatest challenge facing European economic policymakers is the persistently high unemployment rates in Europe, despite an initial improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.7,0)">In addition, we are faced with challenges relating to the fiscal situation in a number of European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">What role can monetary policy play in addressing these problems?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">So far, monetary policy in the euro area has been successful in maintaining stable prices, and it has therefore provided the best possible contribution it can make to sustained growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Monetary policy aside, how should Europe address the problems I mentioned before?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">First, we must recognise that there is a clear need to increase the growth potential in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The Lisbon agenda tried to make a step in this direction to enhance the knowledge based economy, increase labour participation and foster financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Four years after the announcement of these objectives we have to admit that we are far behind schedule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">One of the possible ways forward here will be to focus on the main goals, make them operational, introduce benchmarks for EU member states and measure progress and success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Second, we have to be aware of the huge challenges ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In this respect I refer to the ageing problem in most European countries, the integration of new member states, both in the EU, but also in the monetary union and to further enlargement of the Union in the next decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.41,0)">Apart from that we must not forget that we live in an evolving world where trade patterns change and distances become less and less important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">China and India gain weight in the world economy and corporations move business across borders and continents in order to remain competitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">We in the European Central Bank continue to face the challenge of continuing to build confidence in monetary policy for the euro area, and of improving the degree of transparency and communication about the goals and the conduct of policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">However, with the experiences we have gained during the last six years, I am convinced that these challenges will be managed successfully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Finally, despite the acceleration of financial integration we have witnessed in recent years, I still believe that promoting further integration in euro area financial markets remains an important challenge for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">This will involve continued efforts to harmonise legal frameworks, rules and regulations, and institutional structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Key ingredients in this work will be i.a.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">the further consolidation of the financial industry, banks and clearing and settlement systems in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Conclusions In conclusion, let me sum up our experiences during the past six years as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Monetary unification has definitely been a success – despite all the critical views that were expressed before the project was launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Monetary policy has achieved its goal to maintain price stability and is working well to provide full support to promote higher sustained growth rates and macroeconomic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">EMU has already boosted integration of European financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">However, much remains to be done in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">For the future, the biggest challenges will be to improve the economic dynamics of the euro area, to digest EU enlargement and to implement structural reforms in order to improve the long-term growth potential and to cope with future challenges like population ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">I remain confident about the ability of Europe to meet these challenges in a successful way in the future.</span>
