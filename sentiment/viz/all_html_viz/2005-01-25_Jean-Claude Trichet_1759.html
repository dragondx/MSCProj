    <h1> Communication, transparency and the ECB's monetary policy </h1>
    <h2> Keynote speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the New Year's reception of the International Club of Frankfurt Economic Journalists on 24 January 2005, Frankfurt am Main </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)"> Communication, transparency and the ECB’s monetary policy Keynote speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, at the New Year’s reception of the International Club of Frankfurt Economic Journalists on 24 January 2005, Frankfurt am Main Ladies and gentlemen, It is a great pleasure to be here at the New Year’s reception of the International Club of Frankfurt Economic Journalists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This is certainly the right place for me to discuss the “art of external communication”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The members of this club are among the most experienced and knowledgeable watchers of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Through your reporting you play a decisive role in our communication policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Along with other media you have the important responsibility of informing the public about the Eurosystem’s monetary policy as well as other central banking activities and of contributing to a constructive public dialogue on our policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Much has been said about the external communication of central banks in recent years and central bankers have reflected intensively on their external communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Transparency, candid explanations given to investors, savers, market participants, households and, last but not least, to our 306 million European fellow citizens are of the essence for the ECB and its Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is fair to say that communication is an integral part of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.99,0)">Why are accountability and transparency so important for monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Over the last few decades, it has been widely recognised that the maximum degree of independence for central banks, together with a clearly defined mandate, is the best way to ensure time consistency in the implementation of monetary policy and therefore to guarantee stable prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Consequently, the Maastricht Treaty has granted the ECB full independence in the pursuit of its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In a democracy, transparency and accountability are the quid pro quo for that independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In other words, it is the duty of independent central banks to be transparent and to communicate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">We help to make the ECB accountable by explaining our objectives and decisions to the general public, to the people of Europe, its elected representatives – namely the European Parliament – and to the professionals in the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.33,0)">But transparency is not only a duty for a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">It is clearly also in the bank’s own interest to embark on an effective communication as it contributes considerably to the efficiency of its policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This helps to anchor the inflation expectations of the financial markets and the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Through efficient communication we can reduce inflation uncertainty and the costs associated with such uncertainty for consumers and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Therefore it has immediate economic benefits for society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">We achieve this by being clear about our strategy, clear about our definition of price stability and by being transparent in our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">The economic agents and the public need to be convinced that the central bank’s monetary policy decisions are consistently focused over time on achieving the announced aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">In a market-based economy the central bank can directly influence only short-term interest rates through its monetary policy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.31,0)">However, consumption and investment decisions, and thus medium-term price developments, are to a large extent influenced by longer-term interest rates, which depend on private expectations regarding future central bank decisions and future inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">It is important that these developments in longer-term rates support the objective of maintaining price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This in turn requires that the central bank is regarded as credible and predictable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.15,0)">A central bank which does not succeed in communicating the principles underlying its monetary policy and is perceived as acting in a non-systematic, discretionary manner will over time endanger its reputation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Therefore, the central bank’s communication should ensure that markets understand the systematic responses of monetary policy to economic developments and the current assessment of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Successful central bank communication supports predictability and correct price formation in financial markets, contributes to efficient allocation of funds and reduces uncertainty about future interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">In an environment where the predictability of interest rate movements and their relation with key macroeconomic developments is well understood, firms can better manage their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">This reduces both their vulnerability to economic shocks and their risk management costs and creates the conditions for better investment decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Finally, transparency contributes to macroeconomic stability and long-term growth by enhancing the price and wage setting mechanism, and by improving the functioning of the labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">A credible monetary policy strategy oriented towards price stability contributes to moderate nominal and real wage developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.8,0)">Workers do not have to ask for extra wage increases to compensate for inflation risk and firms know beforehand that they will not be able to pass higher wages on to consumer prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Overall, transparent and credible monetary policy enhances firms ability to manage their production costs, retain profitability and create new jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Transparency of the ECB Let me now turn to the ECB and its concept of transparency and external communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It was understood at an early stage that external communication would be crucial for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Already during the time of the European Monetary Institute the ECB’s future communication policy was discussed; consequently, the ECB’s Governing Council adopted some communication policy objectives and principles as early as 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">They reflect the duty and “self-interest” elements already mentioned: since then we have communicated to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of our monetary policy and to make the ECB, an independent central bank, accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">On this score, the publication of the key elements of the monetary policy strategy back in October 1998 constituted in itself a major step towards monetary policy transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">One element of the strategy is to quantify what the ECB is aiming at in terms of price stability, namely an increase in consumer prices of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This provides guidance for inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">At the same time, it serves the purpose of accountability, for it sets a benchmark against which the ECB’s performance in maintaining price stability can be measured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy strategy also provides a clear and coherent framework for structuring analysis and our discussion in the Governing Council, and it has a remarkable role in structuring our external communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">From the start, it has helped to achieve the consistency between internal analysis and external communication which is the essence of transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is also important for the ECB and the Eurosystem to clearly communicate what monetary policy can, and cannot, achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.61,0)">For example, monetary policy cannot offset short-term changes in the inflation rate which are caused by economic shocks, such as sharp oil price increases or higher administered prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.88,0)">It is thus a permanent challenge to explain any deviations in inflation from the definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">At the same time, it is essential for the public to be confident that such shocks do not call into question the determination and ability of the ECB to deliver price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Already the detailed public display of our monetary policy strategy as such is a very useful communication device.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.69,0)">Of course, real situations are always more complex than the simplified representation that a single model or a single system of equations can offer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">That is the reason why our monetary policy concept is as comprehensive as possible, relying both on an economic analysis and a monetary analysis, and it reserves a central role for judgement, for the collegial wisdom of the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Explaining thoroughly and convincingly our assessment of complex situations is therefore of the essence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">It is this combination of full knowledge of the monetary policy concept and strategy, of precise arithmetic definition of price stability and of detailed explanations on the assessment of the ECB every month which permits market participants to have an intimate understanding of our policy and of the way it is implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.23,0)">In doing so a central bank avoids two opposed inappropriate behaviours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.75,0)">The first would be to give no guidance on its monetary policy and to communicate an unstructured, very complex and partially self-contradictory representation of the economic situation; such behaviour would not permit market participants and public opinion to be able to form pertinent expectations on future monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.99,0)">On the other hand, a central bank cannot in normal times preannounce with an arithmetic precision its future monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These must be derived from the full consistency between strategy and monetary policy concept, the medium-term price stability goal and the economic situation which is itself moving and always incorporates elements of uncertainty, chances and risks that can materialize.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">What is important is that at the moment of the decision, after having had the possibility of analysing all pertinent information and data, market participants can correctly predict our decision thanks to their intimate knowledge of our policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.48,0)">ECB’s communication in practice Some features of the ECB are bringing about major additional challenges for external communications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In particular, the ECB operates in a multicultural environment with 12 different cultures and 10 different languages in the euro area and 25 cultures and 20 languages within the scope of the European System of Central Banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">And, the ECB was given the very ambitious challenge to be fully credible from day one, without track record and to issue a currency which would be immediately as credible as the most credible legacy currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In the practical implementation of the communication policy we make use of a wide range of communication tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.78,0)">I will mention only a few of them here: First, the monthly press conferences after the first Governing Council meeting in each month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The introductory statement at the press conference is a key element in our communication as it conveys the collective view of the ECB’s Governing Council on the monetary policy stance in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.52,0)">In fact, the decision to hold a press conference after each policy meeting was unheard of among major central banks prior to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">To use real time detailed communication and press conferences in this way was a logical decision, bearing in mind i/the attention the ECB would receive as a major player in the world financial markets and the global economy, ii/the necessity to “frontload” the public and the markets with information on the thinking of the new institution and iii/the interest as regards communication at national level through many different languages of having timely public terms of reference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">I do not hesitate to say that this new ECB concept of real time detailed communication has been an important element of the new paradigm in central banking communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.23,0)">Second, there is the ECB’s Monthly Bulletin, which is always published one week after the press conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It gives a more detailed explanation of the analysis behind the monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.05,0)">It regularly reports on information collected by the ECB, such as the bank lending survey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Importantly, it now also includes the ECB staff projections four times a year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.49,0)">An advance copy is published immediately after the Press Conference following the Council meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">This is another example where the ECB has gone very far in making its policy transparent and communicating its economic assessment in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The Monthly Bulletin also contains articles which provide insights into the principles governing our policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Third, the members of the Governing Council give interviews and speeches to many different audiences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In them they explain the decisions taken and the ECB’s view on current topics within our sphere of competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">The decentralised nature of the Eurosystem is an asset especially for communications with the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.09,0)">The Governors address in their country their national public in their own language.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">They are very well placed to participate in economic debates taking place in their home country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Finally, the ECB publishes a large array of statistics, adding essential information on the euro area available to financial markets and all other interested agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">There has been an ongoing process of extending the number of statistical series released by the ECB, which I expect to continue in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As a latest example, last week we have published for the first time a press release providing a geographical breakdown of balance of payments and international investment position statistics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Our concept of transparency Transparency serves our main objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">As we are a unique institution which has no precedent we have to consider very carefully the appropriate concept of transparency in our decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">We are convinced that as a collective body it is beneficial for the Governing Council to give its collegial assessment in the form of a comprehensive and detailed statement rather than only stating the decision and letting the interested parties wait for the detailed statement to be published later in the form of minutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Our method of real-time communication on behalf of the Governing Council also goes to demonstrate that we are collectively accountable to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Each of us inside the 18-member Governing Council has to take into account the superior interests of the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.88,0)">My colleagues and I are convinced that our present real time detailed communication is, in our case which is unique, superior to mentioning individual votes which could wrongly suggest in the eyes of some that the Governing Council is a place where we are confronting national interests which is not the case and should never be the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">As the “porte parole” of the ECB and its Governing Council, I think it is remarkable that we act as a team with high team spirit as regards the handling of a complex communication network dealing with 306 million European fellow citizens speaking their languages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The “single voice” principle in monetary policy was introduced from the very beginning and has been efficiently applied in my judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As regards non-monetary policy decisions by the Governing Council we have adopted a new procedure in December by placing a communication on our website one day after the second meeting of the month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Previously we communicated these decisions in various ways, for example by press releases or by inserting information under other matters into the introductory statement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">I hope that the new procedure will contribute to easier access to non-monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.54,0)">The document refers to “Decisions” which means that, as a rule, it will cover those issues for which the Governing Council has concluded its deliberations, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">decisions have been taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Has the ECB been successful in its monetary policy communication?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Having talked about the objectives of transparency and modes of external communication, I’d now like to consider how successful the ECB has been in establishing credibility and predictability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Evidence can be gained from financial markets and economic surveys.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A key indicator of the credibility of ECB monetary policy comes from expectations of inflation implied by the differences between the returns on index-linked and nominal bonds and inflation-linked swap rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.99,0)">When looking at these market prices, one has to bear in mind that the spread between these nominal and real yields not only measures market participants’ inflation expectations, but also carries the inflation uncertainty risk premium which investors require as compensation for the risk of a loss in purchasing power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Keeping this in mind, and also looking at various measures of long-term inflation expectations in the euro area, such as Consensus Forecast and the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters, one can say that long-term inflation expectations have been pretty well anchored by the ECB’s quantitative definition of price stability from the beginning of the Euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">This is a remarkable success that observers and markets considered quasi impossible before the euro was set up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This does not mean that there is any room for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">Continued vigilance is key to preserve credibility and some increases in long-term inflation expectations last year remind us how important it is to be permanently vigilant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">As regards the short-term predictability of monetary policy, policy moves have been pretty well anticipated by money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Recent studies by academics have confirmed the predictability of the ECB at the highest level amongst major central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Investors have indeed become more confident in their forecasts of future short-term interest rate developments prior to ECB monetary policy announcements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Bond market indicators paint essentially the same picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.24,0)">Implied bond market volatility in the euro area is currently close to its lowest level since January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Communication is an ongoing challenge Financial markets evidence indeed indicates that we as a central bank have managed to be understood by market professionals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.8,0)">But this is only part of the picture and should give no reason for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.59,0)">We are well aware that earning people’s trust in the credibility of the ECB remains an ongoing challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">And we know that the familiarity of the general public with the Eurosystem and the ECB still needs to be further enhanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.95,0)">One indication of the daunting size of our communication task was the issue of so-called perceived inflation rising much higher than the actual measured inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.6,0)">It has turned out to be difficult to explain people that they should not judge the general price level just by observing the prices of some individual goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.05,0)">We see the dichotomy of different target groups in the fact that there was at times a heated debate about deflation risks among financial analysts while at the same time the general public was deeply concerned about inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Fortunately, the gap between perceived and actual price developments is narrowing down again significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">We are responsible for ensuring price stability for 306 million people in the euro area, who use the euro and make economic decisions every day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">So it is essential, absolutely essential, that we preserve and enhance their trust in our single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">They know they can rely on us to preserve their purchasing power over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">We are an anchor of stability created by the Treaty to ensure low inflation, in line with our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me conclude on a more personal note.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.18,0)">The times when central banks were rather reclusive and closed institutions administering interest rates with some dedication to surprise observers and markets have gone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">One of the main goal of a responsible central bank now is to have a reliable communication guiding expectations in a rapidly changing environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In this respect one has to fully realize that the ECB has unique challenges to cope with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">First, when we start the press conference the Vice-President and I know that we are speaking in quasi real time, through all of you, not only to European market participants, investors, savers, economic agents, entrepreneurs but also to all our European fellow citizens to whom we are accountable as a last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This is already a demanding and exciting task taking into account the fact that we are the only major central bank embarking on a press conference immediately after the monetary policy meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Second, on top of that, we are fully conscious that we are speaking simultaneously to twelve different cultures today, and many more when time comes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Making sure that a decision is exactly understood simultaneously by a German, an Italian or a Spanish household, by an Irish, a Portuguese and a Dutch citizen is another extraordinary challenge that no other central bank has to cope with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Third, last but not least, we are also simultaneously speaking to the global market participants who have themselves their own language and their own culture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">For the ECB to be credible means being credible vis-à-vis all parties concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Our transparent communication must permit all parties to understand our mandate and our strategy to ensure price stability, to anchor their medium term and long term expectations and to accurately predict our future behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For the European and global market participants in particular I know how predictability is important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">I attach the utmost importance to our predictability which has been very good in the past, thanks to our conceptual transparency, to our own candid explanations on our diagnosis and decisions and – last but not least – to the quality and lucidity of yourself, members of the International Club of Frankfurt Economic Journalists, of ECB watchers in general, of economists and of market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">I will continue to take care that this predictability remains as excellent as possible.</span>
