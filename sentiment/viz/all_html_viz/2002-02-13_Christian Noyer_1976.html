    <span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)"> Success factors of the euro and the ECB Speech by C. Noyer, Vice-President of the European Central Bank, at the symposium "World Economic Climate after the Introduction of the Euro", organised by Japan Center for International Financeand Sumitomo-Life Research Institute, Tokyo, 13 February 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by expressing what a pleasure and great honour it is for me to have been invited to speak to you here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I already participated in this symposium in 1999, and I very much appreciate this opportunity to discuss with you the factors driving the success of the euro by looking back with you at the first three years of Stage Three of European Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In my brief remarks, I should like, first, to talk about the very recent event that was of particular significance, namely the euro cash changeover, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">the introduction of the new euro notes and coins, and discuss the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Second, I should like to elaborate on the institutional set-up of the European Central Bank   and its objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Finally, I will share with you some views on the experience we have gained with the single monetary policy so far and on the challenges ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The euro cash changeover and the role of the euro Since 1 January this year, more than 300 million citizens in Europe have shared the same tangible currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Now that the new euro banknotes and coins have become the legal tender in 12 of the 15 Member States of the European Union   – Denmark, the United Kingdom and Sweden have not yet adopted the euro – the process of monetary integration laid down in the Maastricht Treaty in 1991 has found its visible expression in the daily life of the residents of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It should be noted that the euro has already been in existence since 1 January 1999, when the exchange rates of the currencies of the euro area countries were irrevocably fixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.63,0)">Until 1 January 2002, however, the euro was the currency of the financial and foreign exchange markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.39,0)">For cash payments, the old national banknotes and coins had to be used in the last three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Although the national currencies were officially regarded as mere expressions of the single currency, the euro – in the eyes of many people – only arrived with the introduction of the new euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The exchange of the old national banknotes and coins of the 12 countries of the euro area for the euro has been a massive operation requiring enormous organisational, logistical, technical and economic efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Its success has far exceeded our own expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">In almost all its aspects, the euro cash changeover has progressed well and rapidly, without any major hitches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">This was a crucial factor for acceptance of the new currency by the European public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The completion of the changeover has been a challenge of unprecedented dimensions that involved the banking sector, security carriers, retailers and the cash-operated machine industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In order to guarantee a gradual and smooth supply of euro to the economy, euro banknotes and coins started to be distributed to the banking and retail sectors as from 1 September last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">6.4 billion banknotes worth some EUR 133 billion, and more than 37.5 billion coins with a total value of around EUR 12.4 billion, had already been frontloaded to the banking sector by the end of 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">The adaptation of more than 200,000 automated teller machines  , which supplied around 70% of the new banknotes utilised for transactions within less than one week, was another key factor in the euro cash changeover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">From the outset, European citizens showed a great deal of enthusiasm and have been very fast in adopting their new money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Two weeks after the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins, the value of euro banknotes in circulation was higher than that of national banknotes, and the vast majority of cash transactions in the euro area were being conducted in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the last few months, the Eurosystem, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">the ECB and the national central banks   of the 12 EU Member States participating in the euro area, and a number of other parties, such as retailers, educational institutions, the tourism industry and the media, were heavily involved in the information campaign which acquainted the general public with the new money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">The euro banknotes are endowed with distinctive characteristics and state-of-the-art security features which not only enable the public and professional cash handlers to recognise and check them quickly, but also make them some of the world's safest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">The transition to the new banknotes and coins was facilitated by the fact that the financial markets were already fully accustomed to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">The introduction of the single currency three years ago was another exceptional success that opened the way to fundamental changes in the conditions in which governments, financial institutions and the private sector operate in financial markets of the euro area and in the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Within the euro area, the elimination of exchange rate risks and the lower transaction costs which followed, together with the far more transparent markets the euro brought with it, have created new opportunities for businesses and forced firms to attain higher levels of efficiency and competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">A further success factor for the euro has been and still is its role as a catalyst in the process of financial integration, thereby enhancing the widening and deepening of the euro area financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">A large, liquid and integrated money market was rapidly created after 1 January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This, in turn, triggered a significant growth of interest-bearing instruments denominated in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">On the unsecured money market, the EONIA   reference rate, an interbank overnight interest rate index compiled by the ECB, has established itself as one of the most important, perhaps even the most important, reference rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The EONIA swap market is now considered the largest overnight swap market in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">In the bond market, too, the euro played a crucial role in fostering the deeper and more liquid euro area bond market that we see today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">As early as in 1999, the total amount outstanding of euro-denominated debt securities made the euro bond market the second largest bond market in the world, and the international issuance of the euro-denominated bonds has even outpaced that of US dollar-denominated bonds for a few months at a time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">At the international level, the euro has become the second most widely used currency as a result of the overall weight of the euro area economy in the world and the legacy of the national currencies which were replaced by the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Looking at official international uses, the euro is second only to the US dollar among the world's official reserve currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.01,0)">The gap between the two currencies, however, is wide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">According to the latest available data, the euro accounted for around 13% of the world's official foreign currency holdings at the end of 1999, compared with a US dollar share of around 70%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Experience has shown, however, that there is a considerable time lag before the importance of a currency, as indicated by the economic weight of the country issuing that currency, is reflected in its use as an official reserve currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">As an anchor currency, the euro plays a role in the exchange rate regimes of more than 50 countries outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The solutions adopted by these countries range from very close, or even full, links to the euro, such as the unilateral entitlement to use the euro as legal tender – euroisation – to looser types of anchoring, such as peg arrangements and crawling fluctuation bands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">I would like to conclude this brief overview of the international role of the euro by emphasising that developments in this field will be the outcome, first and foremost, of a market-driven process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">At this point, let me move the focus of my presentation from the introduction of the euro and its role in financial markets to the institutional factors behind the success of the ECB and its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The institutional set-up and the objectives of the ECB The Treaty establishing the European Community assigned to the ECB the maintenance of price stability in the euro area – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">the internal stability of the euro – as its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">It is through the credible and lasting maintenance of price stability over the medium term that the ECB can best contribute to sustained long-run economic growth, employment creation and better standards of living.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.96,0)">In our view, the uncertainties surrounding the monetary policy transmission mechanism, part of which arises from the continuous evolution of economic behaviour and institutional structures, make the central bank ill-suited to fine-tune economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Without prejudice to its primary objective, the ECB shall also support the general economic policies of the European Community, such as the enhancement of output growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This does not, however, mean that the ECB bears responsibility for objectives other than price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">By giving its monetary policy a medium-term orientation, the ECB does show concern for, and contribute to, smoothing output fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It is clear, however, that the instruments and the mandate to promote potential output and employment lie with structural policies, and thus primarily at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The allocation of tasks and objectives to different policy-makers in the euro area is thus very clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The budgetary provisions in the Treaty, which limit the level of government deficits and debts, and the Stability and Growth Pact, which introduced the goal of budgetary positions close to balance or in surplus as a medium-term objective for Member States, have been key to achieving sounder public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">For purposes of supporting and safeguarding the pursuit of price stability, the Treaty has endowed the ECB with a high degree of institutional independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Being protected from potential political pressure is a further crucial factor for the success of the ECB in allowing it to guarantee European citizens a long-term euro area perspective in pursuing its mandate of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.22,0)">In order to assure transparency and accountability with respect to its policy design and implementation, the Treaty has imposed extensive reporting requirements on the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The ECB has even exceeded these requirements, thereby meeting very high standards in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.23,0)">Monetary policy decisions are regularly explained in the press conference the President and I give after the first meeting of the ECB Governing Council every month, in the Monthly Bulletin of the ECB, in the speeches given by members of the Governing Council and in the testimonies of the President at the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">For purposes of setting out how it goes about in achieving its Treaty mandate, the ECB has announced a medium term-oriented monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">To enhance clarity, to anchor expectations and to offer a yardstick against which the ECB can be held accountable, the Governing Council of the ECB has, in particular, provided a numerical definition of price stability which is "a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Recognition of the fact that monetary policy has to contend with an ever changing and imperfectly known world has been a key consideration in the design of the ECB's monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">The Governing Council chose to equip itself with an internally consistent and robust framework for analysing economic developments and shocks, which we call our two-pillar strategy of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Given the long-term monetary nature of inflation, a first pillar of our strategy assigns a prominent role to money, implying the use of monetary analyses, and of models, in which monetary aggregates play an important role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In parallel, a second pillar ensures that other forms of analysis and models, such as the investigation of the interplay between supply and demand and cost-push dynamics, are also incorporated into the policy-making process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Together, the two pillars ensure a comprehensive assessment of the economic situation, of the size and nature of the shocks hitting the euro area and of the related risks to price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">The robust assessment and the cross-checking of information which characterises our strategy has proved to provide the Governing Council with the analytical support most suitable for the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">It is widely acknowledged that the ECB's monetary policy has contributed to keeping inflation expectations in line with the ECB's definition of price stability, although short-term shocks pushed HICP inflation temporarily above 2% in the course of 2000 and 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.15,0)">The financial markets, well known for their pitiless judgement, have moreover been confirming the credibility of our monetary policy from the very outset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">The development of long-term interest rates has in fact been in line with our objective of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This is not an insignificant achievement, and we are committed to not putting it at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.36,0)">Following the introduction of euro banknotes and coins, there is some concern among the public about potential inflationary effects stemming from the rounding upwards of prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Compared with December 2001, inflation in the euro area has increased in January 2002  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">However, this increase was largely anticipated by the ECB and is due to a number of factors, including so-called base effects, bad weather   and higher indirect taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.54,0)">The contribution of the cash changeover to the increase in inflation in January is probably limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Indeed, we have seen rounding happen in both directions, up and down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.47,0)">As a matter of fact, there has been very little evidence so far of effects of the cash changeover on the average level of prices in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This is largely due to the stronger competition which the euro is fostering in the retail sector, together with continued awareness on the part of consumers and the commitment of governments not to increase the average level of administered prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.85,0)">This said, we will of course remain vigilant with respect to the possibility of an impact on inflation rates in the first months of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Over the long run, however, downward pressures on prices should predominate in the euro area, thanks to the increased transparency and stronger price competition the physical introduction of the euro has been inducing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude my presentation by addressing the challenges that lie ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I am referring, in particular, to the enlargement of the European Union and, subsequently, of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Currently, 12 countries from central, eastern and southern Europe are negotiating the terms and conditions for their becoming members of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">Integrating such a large number of new applicants in the European Union will be an enormous task for all the parties involved, not least in view of the significant differences in economic conditions in most of these countries in relation to the current Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Considerable efforts will be required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The reward, we believe, will be the smoothing of the road towards the pursuit of a common European objective in the future.</span>
