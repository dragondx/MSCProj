    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)"> The role of euro banknotes as legal tender Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 4th Bargeldsymposium of the Deutsche Bundesbank, Frankfurt am Main, 14 February 2018 First of all, I would like to thank the Deutsche Bundesbank organisers for inviting me to speak at this symposium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The particularly good cooperation between the various Eurosystem central banks in the field of cash is not only part of our core business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It also serves the people of Europe, for whom euro cash has an important function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.76,0)">But our cash has recently come in for greater criticism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Last year alone, five Member States  consulted the ECB on measures to limit the use of cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">This represents a sharp increase compared with the number of consultations on this topic in previous years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.42,0)">Opposition to cash is coming from different quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.76,0)">On the one hand, the “law and order” school says that criminals use cash to finance their illegal activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.28,0)">Others, meanwhile, who have developed business models involving new electronic payment methods, point to the “cost” of cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.35,0)">We have to address these arguments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In the next few minutes, I would like to consider the following questions: Why does the Treaty  grant   legal tender status to euro banknotes?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.66,0)">In other words, why is there legal tender status at all?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">What is the role of the ECB and the Eurosystem in protecting this status?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.47,0)">And what implications does this have for our activities in the Eurosystem?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Euro banknotes, and only euro banknotes, are protected as legal tender under the primary law of Article 128  TFEU .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.67,0)">But what exactly is legal tender?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There is a Commission recommendation on this point .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.21,0)">It is not binding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">But it does provide for the following key elements: mandatory acceptance   legally recognised means for repaying a debt, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">with a discharging effect at face value, with no levying of additional fees permitted  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.79,0)">Precisely what else can be deduced from the legal tender status is a question of interpretation: the Treaty and the binding secondary legislation do not define the content of the legal tender status.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The national arrangements of the 19 Member States of the euro area relating to the legal tender status which predate the introduction of the euro continue to apply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.55,0)">In practice, they determine the concrete effects of the legal tender  in daily payment transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.77,0)">This includes restrictions on the use of the legal tender by way of national regulatory arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Such restrictions can certainly vary from one Member State to another, but the legal tender status as such, so to speak the “nature” of our banknotes, including the core elements of this status mentioned before, must be preserved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We monitor this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I’ll come back to this shortly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.57,0)">Why does legal tender status exist at all?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The relevant provision in the Treaty  does not itself constitute a fundamental right or is not equivalent to a fundamental right  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.66,0)">So there is no “right to cash” or “right to cash payment in all cases”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">But the granting of legal tender status to euro banknotes under the TFEU, and thus at constitutional level, does concern fundamental rights and fulfils at the same time an important institutional function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.76,0)">Euro banknotes do not exist “for their own sake” or to allow us central banks to obtain seigniorage, but for reasons that are protected under constitutional law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Cash as legal tender facilitates freedom Cash, as a medium of transaction in many instances, opens the way for the exercise of many fundamental rights – it costs money to live and money has to be earned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Cash allows privacy and thus safeguards fundamental rights, such as the right to “informational self-determination”, freedom of action and freedom of speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Citizens can use cash to exercise their fundamental rights without the state or other third parties being able to immediately track any financial transactions involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.7,0)">This aspect is particularly relevant considering the criticism I mentioned before that cash-facilitated privacy aids and abets criminal activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Protection of privacy matters to all of us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.9,0)">Privacy protects people from the risk of a surveillance state and thought police.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.31,0)">No particular link can be established statistically between cash and criminal activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The focus must be on the fight against crime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.44,0)">Cash must not be made the scapegoat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It’s astonishing that alternative means of payment, such as bitcoin – very popular among cybercriminals – are subject to much less criticism than cash despite the risks they entail and the scope for misuse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Cash as legal tender allows equality and participation The store-of-value function of cash is directly linked to property rights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The easy accessibility to cash, especially for the elderly, the socially vulnerable or minors, allows people to participate in society and, for example, allows children to learn how to handle money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In particular, when socially vulnerable people use cash, they face none of the barriers involved in applying for a credit card or, despite all their efforts, opening a current account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Cash as legal tender provides security and protection Cash “always works”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.01,0)">If alternative means of payment are no longer possible, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">because of a power or network failure, society can continue to function because of cash – in any case as long as the ATMs work or we manage, for example, in times of crisis to replace this infrastructure unbureaucratically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Cash thus clearly enhances the resilience of society and ensures its functioning particularly in critical periods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.68,0)">Many people use cash to buy everyday items, but not to pay larger sums.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">They cleverly weigh up the risks, burdens and benefits, such as protecting their privacy by making anonymous cash payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The statistics show that “average” Europeans have about €1,600 net at their disposal every month.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Once rent and other fixed costs have been deducted, many people evidently carry out “cash-suitable” transactions above all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.01,0)">Of course, “shoe leather costs” play an important role in people’s calculations, such as the distance from an ATM or the acceptance of euro cash abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.42,0)">People who frequently have to handle large sums of money or who, for business or private reasons, often   stay in other currency areas may find it practical to make their payments with a card and not to have to go first to an ATM or a bureau de change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But that certainly doesn’t mean that these people – especially here in Germany – would be willing to give up their cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.13,0)">What is the role of the ECB and the Eurosystem in protecting the legal tender?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The ECB, as the European institution at the heart of the Eurosystem, has a particular role to play, and not just in terms of monetary policy in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As the central bank which authorises the issuance of euro banknotes,  the ECB is also responsible in particular for protecting the status of euro cash as the sole legal tender.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">This includes guaranteeing the existence of euro cash and its usability as legal tender.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In fulfilling these tasks, the ECB ultimately ensures that people can go about their lives, with their fundamental rights protected, using euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The ECB establishes the legal framework that protects euro banknotes, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.89,0)">We decide what types of reproduction are permitted  and, together with the national central banks, clamp down on unauthorised reproductions .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">This helps to preserve public confidence in euro cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">We keep a constant eye on costs, in terms of regulation too, to ensure that the provision of cash remains cost-effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Here we have an obligation to the public to increase efficiency even further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">We ensure that cash retains its scope for use and we take action if the legal tender status is at risk..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the legislative field, our efforts to protect and safeguard the currency mainly take the form of ECB opinions on legislative proposals at national or EU level which relate to our tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The ECB has to be consulted on all such legislative proposals,  especially when they have the effect of limiting the legal tender status of euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.97,0)">Until 2016, these consultations by Member States on limiting the use of cash were a routine exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">From the first consultations the ECB established the position  that national measures in this area must: have a legitimate purpose and to that end be proportionate, that is suitable, necessary and adequate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">“Suitable” in this case means that the planned legislative measures will actually be able to achieve their aim, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">that they are efficient and effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">On the basis of this position, the ECB has recognised, in particular, the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion as legitimate purposes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">There has been no criticism when Member States have planned proportionate measures to address these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Since around 2016, and with the peak I mentioned in 2017, the ECB, with increasing regularity, has had to address in detail the topic of limits to cash payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.02,0)">We have maintained a consistent position on this and, for the first time, we found ourselves having to comment on measures that were not suitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">These measures involved limiting the use of cash for transactions that are not subject to tax.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">The national legislator had justified the measures on the grounds that they would help prevent tax evasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">However, limits on non-taxable payments do not help to combat tax evasion .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.9,0)">With due respect for the prerogative of the legislator to evaluate the matter, the ECB must point out such errors of assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.64,0)">We also faced for the first time, in the context of a consultation on a very low proposed cash limit, the question of whether the legal tender status of a banknote is undermined if limits on cash payments make it impossible to use a certain denomination in transactions .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.71,0)">This would be tantamount to abolishing that denomination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.83,0)">But only the Governing Council of the ECB can make such decisions about the denominations of euro banknotes, and that includes the decision on whether to discontinue certain denominations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.61,0)">So there must be scope for all denominations of the legal tender to be used, otherwise this competence of the Governing Council would be undermined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.57,0)">General, non-sector-specific limits on cash which largely preclude the use of a denomination are therefore likely to be very difficult to justify.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In this context, I would like to comment on our decision on the €500 banknote.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.85,0)">We have decided not to issue a €500 banknote in the second series of euro banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">However, €500 banknotes from the first series – which some Europeans probably have under their mattresses – retain their status as legal tender.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.77,0)">So people need not worry that their €500 banknotes will lose their value and can continue to use them as a means of payment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Ultimately, the Treaty includes a limit to limits on cash by assigning legal tender status to the euro banknote denominations as determined by the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">We at the ECB monitor compliance with this provision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.15,0)">We would also intervene – but fortunately have not yet had to – if there were cases of discrimination against cash as legal tender compared with alternative private payment methods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.1,0)">This could happen, for example, if a payment fee were to be levied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.3,0)">You will recall that a core feature of legal tender is that banknotes must be accepted at their face value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.39,0)">Anyone who has paid by card when booking a flight is aware of the difference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In the case of card payments, additional payment fees are allowed and are standard practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.85,0)">Conclusion: What are the implications for our activities within the Eurosystem?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">I will conclude by saying that printed euro banknotes will retain their place and their role in society as legal tender for a very long time to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.61,0)">There is no viable alternative to euro cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There is good reason to believe that banknotes don’t only have to take the form of printed paper, cotton or polymer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">However, printed banknotes will remain our core business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And if there is public demand for digital central bank money, this should only be a technical variant of cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.85,0)">Alternative payment methods cannot replace euro cash; they can only complement it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The Eurosystem must therefore continue to ensure the existence of euro cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This is the only way we can safeguard the role that euro banknotes and coins play in protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of the people of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">Protecting the legal tender status of our banknotes will still call for a high level of vigilance from the ECB and the NCBs, in particular in order to prevent unwarranted limits and thereby ensure support for the euro and its existence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">New legislative initiatives, such as those at EU level to define what constitutes legal tender, require intensive dialogue between the ECB and the legislators.</span>
