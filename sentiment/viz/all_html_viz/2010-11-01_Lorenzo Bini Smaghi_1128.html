    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.58,0)"> The Challenges Facing the Euro Area Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the OMFIF MeetingAbu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates1 November 2010 Over the coming months and years the euro area will face two types of challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">The first one – which is very similar to that of other major advanced economies – is to consolidate public finances and at the same time restore economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">The second challenge – more idiosyncratic – is to strengthen the institutional basis of the single currency so as to avoid having to face again the problems we experienced in the recent crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me address these two challenges in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.6,0)">Concerning the current economic challenges, euro area policy makers share the following five points: The crisis is the result of a combination of structural and cyclical factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Overcoming the crisis thus requires both macroeconomic and structural policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.52,0)">Macroeconomic policies have been quite effective in counteracting depressionnary forces, especially after the Lehman Brothers’ crisis, but they cannot by themselves bring the economy back to the pre-crisis growth path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Structural measures are essential to increase growth potential of euro area economies over the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.73,0)">They affect different policy areas, such as the labour markets or the banking system, which in many countries need to be strengthened and restructured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">As far as monetary policy is concerned, the non-standard measures implemented during the crisis have contributed to the smooth functioning of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The flow of credit to the private sector is progressively rebounding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.33,0)">The exceptional measures are being removed as economic and financial market conditions improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Fiscal policy needs to be adjusted and brought on a sustainable path, with a view to preserve – or restore – the confidence of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.5,0)">I would like to elaborate on the last point, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Although there is a broad agreement on the need for consolidation in the euro area, the situation differs across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Some are in a better condition, either because they kept firmer control over public finances prior to the crisis or because they are experiencing stronger growth performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.9,0)">The situation is more challenging in countries where economic growth is sluggish and large fiscal imbalances have been accumulated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.51,0)">There is a risk of a vicious circle, which can develop as a result of the following: Restrictive fiscal policies are politically difficult to implement and thus tend to be delayed, because of the feared negative impact on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.02,0)">As countries show hesitation in addressing their budgetary problems, access to financial markets tends to become more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.71,0)">When market access deteriorates, the budgetary measures required to restore confidence are much more drastic and painful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.13,0)">Some observers, especially outside Europe, have suggested that European democracies are not able to deal with such a vicious circle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.83,0)">They consider that the only way out of the dilemma is a default, or a partial default.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Some have – even recently – voiced openly this view, maybe with the intent to influence financial markets and increase the probability of such an event to occur; an event from which they would presumably take profit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.41,0)">This view, however, does not take into consideration that in advanced economies a sovereign default is very damaging for the citizens of the country concerned, as it would drastically affect their wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.43,0)">Increasing the primary surplus, either by cutting expenditure or by increasing – in certain cases by starting to pay – taxes, has in most cases less damaging effects on the economy and on citizens’ well-being than a cut in the value of their financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.97,0)">To sum up, consolidating public finances is painful economically and politically, but the alternative is worse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Governments in Europe are fully aware of this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Let me move to the second issue, which concerns the strengthening of the institutional framework underlying the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To understand the issue one should first consider what did not work as expected during the first ten years of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.34,0)">Two main things did not work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.21,0)">First, in some countries the behaviour of the private and public sector was not fully consistent with the long run requirements of a single currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.18,0)">Divergences may occur in currency unions, or even within countries, as some regions may grow more than others and experience booms which then burst.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.76,0)">In the euro area, the lack of a federal budget transforms country-specific shocks into public finance shocks and thus financial stability shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This is why a currency union like the euro area needs a system of discipline for both the public and the private sector, to be exercised at the level of the member states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.22,0)">The euro area had a system aimed at disciplining the public sector, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">the Stability and Growth Pact  , with rules and procedures aimed at avoiding excessive deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The Pact worked in some cases, but not all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.85,0)">The main reason has been that the Eurogroup, which comprises the Finance Ministers of the euro area and is in charge of implementing the SGP, has not been able to put sufficient pressure on countries to ensure fiscal discipline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.49,0)">To quote a frequently used sentence, “ When potential future sinners have to judge current sinners, the tendency for forgiveness prevails”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.89,0)">The euro area had no system to discipline the private sector and avoid imbalances, especially for catching up countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.56,0)">Even when presented with evidence about the growing divergences in cost competitiveness, the Eurogroup did not show much interest and did not take action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">However, there is substantial evidence showing that in countries which experienced major competitiveness losses public sector wages often led the way for pay rises in the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.11,0)">Furthermore, excessive private credit growth, especially mortgages, has often been the result of distortionary tax treatments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.69,0)">How can the problem be fixed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">There are two avenues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The first is to recognize the limited powers of the Eurogroup and move to a rules-based system, with automatic procedures and sanctions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">That was the approach followed by the ECB in its published proposal for reform of the SGP, and partly also the approach of the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The Heads of State and Government of the European Union followed a second avenue, as they wanted to retain the ability to decide on budgetary matters, in particular concerning the imposition of sanctions on countries not respecting the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.1,0)">They did not want to deprive themselves of their powers in favour of the European Commission, nor to bind themselves with a rules-based approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This position might be understandable from a political point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.16,0)">But it doesn’t resolve the problem that I raised previously, concerning potential sinners forgiving the current ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">No change has been made to the system of governance aimed at reducing the perverse incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.03,0)">Why should the Eurogroup be expected to behave in the future any differently than in the past?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.41,0)">The question remains unanswered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.67,0)">The discussion is not over yet, as the new mechanism will now have to be discussed and agreed with the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The Parliament might come up with ways to make the Eurogroup more accountable in its implementation of the SGP, with a view to safeguard the general interests for sound budgetary policies against the incentives for mutual forgiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.61,0)">The second failure was to assume that simply by adopting a system of rules there would be no more crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">If there are no crises there is no need for a crisis management framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.5,0)">This was very naïve and ultimately turned out to be a mistake.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Experience shows that crises do occur, even in the best of worlds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Of course, it’s not easy to build a crisis management framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">But it might not be that complicated either, learning from the experience of the International Monetary Fund and the European Financial Stability Fund, which has just been built to address the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">I believe that there is a broad agreement on what we don’t want.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.06,0)">We don’t want a system which: creates moral hazard and induces countries to embark on loose policies in the expectation that they would be bailed out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.04,0)">makes taxpayers   having to bail out bad investment decisions made by the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.57,0)">creates incentives for speculative attacks that could push into bankruptcy even an otherwise solvent country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">To achieve these objectives, we don’t have to reinvent the wheel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We have the model of the IMF to guide us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I would just make three main points in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">First, the best way to avoid moral hazard is to attach strong conditionality to any support package.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In addition, any financial support has to be at penalty rates, as it is the case for the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Over time the IMF-style conditionality has led to a sharp reduction of the number of countries resorting to the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">No country turns happily to the IMF for financial support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Second, the best way to avoid that taxpayers bail out private investors is to ensure that any support provided by the new European mechanism has preferred creditor status, like the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.6,0)">This means that the funds lent by the institution have to be reimbursed first, before the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Again, the experience shows that countries do reimburse the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.49,0)">When countries are in arrears with the IMF – which is currently the case of Somalia, Sudan and Zimbabwe - they have de-facto exited the International Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The existing EFSF does not have preferred creditor status because it is the result of an inter-governmental agreement rather than a supra-national institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The European Investment Bank, instead, which is inscribed in the EU Treaty enjoys preferred creditor status.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Given that the new mechanism will be created as a result of a Treaty change, it can have a preferred status.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Third, the best way to avoid triggering speculative attacks against the member states is to link the financial support provided to countries to the latter’s ability to repay, in particular to debt sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.76,0)">There should be no automatic mechanism linking financial support to debt restructuring, because it would attract speculative pressure and precipitate a crisis, even for countries that are solvent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.13,0)">This raises the issue of how to deal with countries that are not in a position to repay all their debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.89,0)">Such a possibility cannot be excluded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.05,0)">Again, the experience of the IMF shows that there have been cases of debt restructuring associated with Fund programmes, even though debt restructuring is not considered in the Articles of Agreement of the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,107.3,0)">Out of 113 IMF support programmes over the last 20 years, only 19 countries defaulted or restructured their debts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The countries which went through such action – Algeria, Argentina, Cote d’Ivoire, Dominican republic, Ecuador, Gabon, Grenada, Indonesia, Kenya, Moldova, Nigeria, Pakistan, Paraguay, Russia, Seychelles, Ukraine, Uruguay, Venezuela, Zimbabwe – have characteristics which are not very similar to euro area members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.2,0)">In all these cases restructuring was done on a case-by-case basis, depending on the specific circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">It is suggested by some that precise rules and conditions for debt restructuring should be attached to the creation of the new European mechanism, with a view to achieve an orderly restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.62,0)">In my view this is “unnecessary, undesirable, and unlikely”, to quote a recent Staff paper by the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.86,0)">It is unnecessary because experience shows that restructuring can take place even without international norms and without the IMF being given specific powers in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.37,0)">It is undesirable because there is a risk that norms designed at addressing problems of the past are not any more valid for complex financial systems and may even aggravate the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.22,0)">Most crises of the past had to deal mainly with foreign creditors of developing countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In advanced economies the restructuring of the public debt would have to involve a much larger number of financial assets and liabilities, including those of the domestic banking system vis-à-vis residents and non residents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It can be easily seen that there can hardly be anything “orderly” in such a process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Attempts to work on this issue should certainly not be discouraged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">The IMF experience in this field is again telling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">There studies and discussions on the design of a mechanism for Sovereign Debt Restructuring took much effort and lasted several years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The result was intellectually interesting but ultimately not agreed, neither by the sovereign states neither by financial market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.67,0)">This doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">But we should be aware that calling for an orderly debt restructuring mechanism sounds nice and is costless.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Designing and implementing it is somewhat different, and has not been done yet, like many other nice catchwords which have attracted our intellectual interest in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">Some work can be done, and has been done, in developing mechanisms which make it easier for creditors and debtors to agree on revising the contractual terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Substantial work has been done for instance on collective action clauses, which set minimum thresholds for debtor representation needed to agree on a restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.69,0)">These mechanisms exist currently in many national laws.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">It might be more promising and pragmatic to further explore this avenue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.22,0)">To conclude, the euro area is facing several challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.3,0)">Some are similar to those of other countries, some are idiosyncratic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">If the experience of the last few months teaches us something it is that Europeans are fully aware of these challenges and want to address them to make sure that the euro area gets out from this crisis stronger than before.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Many of the actions taken so far will indeed make it stronger and more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">On other measures the discussion is still ongoing and the jury is out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.02,0)">I recognize that seen from far away, it’s sometimes difficult to understand what’s really going on in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.99,0)">It’s difficult to follow the debate, to forecast the outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is perfectly understandable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.25,0)">As in all democracies decisions are preceded by intense debates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.9,0)">In Europe we have the additional complication that the debate takes place not only within countries but also between countries, in the open.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.01,0)">When decisions are made, and compromises are struck, which by definition cannot make everybody happy, additional debates develop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.39,0)">This may be disorienting for outsiders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.6,0)">You may need a compass.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">We have a clear compass to use in Europe, it’s the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">It guides us every day, for instance in the conduct of monetary policy in the euro area, providing the central bank with a clear objective for the benefit of European citizens; an objective which has been achieved over the last ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The Treaty also guides other institutions in their functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.97,0)">This might not be enough, as the compass may not always be sufficiently precise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">What’s important is to recognize such shortcomings and stand ready to address them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">What one should take from the series of decisions that have been made over the last few months, including that of changing the Treaty, is the willingness to build a stronger Europe, a stronger and more resilient euro area, capable of facing future crises.</span>
