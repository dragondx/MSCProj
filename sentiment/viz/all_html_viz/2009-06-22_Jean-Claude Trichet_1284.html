    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)"> Supporting the financial system and the economy: key ECB policy actions in the crisis Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECBat a Conference organised by the Nueva Economía Fórum and The Wall Street Journal EuropeMadrid, 22 June 2009 Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the organisers for inviting me today to talk about the ECB’s policy actions in these times of truly unprecedented challenges – for our financial system, for the businesses large and small that drive our economy and for the citizens of Spain, the euro area and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As some of you might remember, I was here in Madrid five years ago to give a speech on “The challenges for the European economy in 2004”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">At that time one important issue was whether the economic recovery that had become apparent in the second half of 2003 would gather momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Another important issue was the need for economic policies that would make the euro area economy more resilient to sudden and sometimes unexpected events and to foster its potential for sustainable long term growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.75,0)">Needless to say, the challenges the euro area currently faces are of a different order of magnitude than in 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Yet, at a fundamental level, the key issues are similar, namely how to pave the way for a robust recovery and how to increase the long term growth potential in a sustainable manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In my view these two questions – the cyclical and the structural – are closely entwined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">To restore confidence in the near-term and the long-term future, policymakers in the euro area and elsewhere must maintain an appropriate balance between bold short-term action and the return to a path that is sustainable in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">As I will explain, the ECB’s policy actions since the onset of the financial crisis have been at the same time very bold and strongly anchored in the medium-term framework of our monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.9,0)">We were the first to act when signs of financial stress emerged back in August 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">We stepped forcefully into the breach when the collapse of a major financial player abroad threatened global financial stability last autumn, embarking in a full allotment mode with fixed rates for the supply of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">And in recent months, we have further deepened the set of measures that we call our policy of “enhanced credit support”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">All the measures we are using share two crucial features: first, they are designed to be effective in preserving the functioning of the money market, the appropriate financing of the economy and taking into account the very significant rebalancing of inflationary risks; second, they can be easily unwound once the financial crisis attenuates and when we see any risks of a future rise in inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">These two features ensure that all measures taken are fully consistent with the ECB’s primary objective, which is to preserve price stability in the euro area over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Beyond monetary policy, I see two policy priorities going forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">First, governments need to spell out how they envisage unwinding the crisis-related fiscal stimulus measures to return to sustainable fiscal positions in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">This is particularly important as substantial support for the financial sector might still be needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.04,0)">While this support often does not directly affect fiscal balances, it creates contingent liabilities that may have to be catered for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Second, the urgent need for reform of the global financial architecture should not distract from the need for further progress with labor and product market reform in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Rigorous implementation of the Lisbon reform agenda remains as pressing as ever, as increased productivity and efficiency will not only foster the development of the private sector, but also facilitate the return to sustainable fiscal positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.52,0)">In my remarks today, I would like first to recall the origins of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">I will then explain in detail the various actions the ECB has taken to support the euro area economy and the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Before concluding, I will also say a few words on the specific challenges currently facing the Spanish economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The roots of the financial crisis and its propagation Over the past ten years, we have witnessed a dramatic shift of focus in large parts of the financial sector – away from facilitating trade and real investment towards unfettered speculation and financial gambling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">To be clear, I do not deny that financial liberalisation and financial innovation over the past two decades have made important contributions to the overall productivity of our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">For example, the securitisation of assets – the transformation of bilateral loans into tradable credit instruments – had tremendous potential for the diversification and efficient management of economic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But the way securitisation was implemented also meant that banks and non-banks were able not only to sell loans, but also often to place them fully off-balance sheet immediately after they had been extended.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.92,0)">This weakened their incentives to conduct prudent screening and constant monitoring of loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This is true only for the most recent product innovations in the field of securitisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.11,0)">It is not true for a financial innovation that is more than two hundred years old: covered bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I will return to this asset class and give you a detailed assessment when I describe the ECB’s recent policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.86,0)">The credit boom was exacerbated by three multipliers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.43,0)">First, incentives: ill-designed compensation schemes for loan managers and traders reinforced the shortening of their time horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.12,0)">Second, complexity: increasingly complicated and opaque financial instruments made it difficult for holders of securities to assess the quality of the underlying investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.14,0)">And third, global macroeconomic imbalances: a chronic shortage of savings in some industrialised economies was made possible by an excess of savings in other parts of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.77,0)">This acted as a multiplier that was exacerbated during the years immediately preceding the crisis by the sharply rising prices of oil and other commodities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.71,0)">In mid-2007, suddenly though not unexpectedly, the interactions of perverse incentives, excessive complexity and global imbalances threw the credit boom into reverse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.77,0)">The asset cycle turned, and many of the missing links in the financial chain were exposed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.76,0)">The collapse in mid-September last year of a major financial player, turned a large-scale crisis of confidence into a global financial panic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.39,0)">As the intensity of the crisis became evident, financial intermediaries restored liquidity buffers, scaled down their balance sheets and tightened lending conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Financial institutions dramatically reduced their exposure to the risks that they had imprudently accumulated during the phase of financial euphoria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Collectively, they engaged in a large-scale process of “deleveraging”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.74,0)">Banks’ intermediation was reduced in the aggregate, and loans to companies were curtailed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.82,0)">The credit squeeze and the toll on the real economy set in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">ECB policy actions in the financial crisis As I have said, the ECB has taken swift and forceful action to mitigate the effects of the crisis as events have unfolded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">We were the first to act back in August 2007, temporarily providing on day 1 of the turmoil unlimited liquidity to preserve as normal as possible the functioning of the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.2,0)">Allow me to stress that our measures together with the support measures of euro area governments have yielded one very important result that sometimes seems to be overlooked: there has not been a single failure of a systematically relevant financial institution in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">This is an achievement whose importance cannot be overstated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The ECB’s policy actions have at all times been carefully calibrated to the structure of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.9,0)">This relates in particular to its financial structure, which differs profoundly from that of the United States, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The euro area has a largely bank-centred financial system, whereas that of the United States is primarily market-based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.17,0)">A few numbers illustrate these differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">At the end of 2007, the stock of outstanding bank loans to the private sector amounted to around 145% of GDP in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.46,0)">The corresponding proportion of bank loans to GDP in the United States was only 63%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">This means that the banking sector is more than twice as important in the euro area as it is in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It also means that to be effective, ECB policy must focus first and foremost on the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The euro area financial structure I have just described provides the background for our policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">These policies are guided by our monetary policy strategy, a key element of which is the quantitative definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">We aim at an inflation rate of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The precise quantification of our policy objective has proved an invaluable asset, a fail-safe mechanism against excessive swings in inflation expectations, downwards as much as upwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">Long-term inflation expectations in the euro area, whether based on surveys or extracted from financial indicators, have been exceptionally resistant to sudden short-term price changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">We will ensure that inflation expectations remain impervious to short-term changes in inflation, even in the face of sharply falling inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The ECB’s responses to the financial crisis are in line both with the euro area financial structure and with our medium-term objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Since the intensification of the financial crisis in September of last year – and against the background of rapidly receding inflationary pressures –, we have taken monetary policy measures that are unprecedented in nature, scope and magnitude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These measures fall in two categories: first, conventional measures in the form of interest rate changes; second, what have become known as ‘non-standard’ measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The latter measures taken together constitute what we call the ECB’s policy of enhanced credit support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">These are specific actions we have taken to sustain the flow of credit above and beyond what could be achieved through interest rate reductions alone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Interest rate action Before explaining in detail the core elements of our policy of enhanced credit support, I would like to talk briefly about interest rates – the conventional indicators of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.43,0)">Since October of last year we have cut our key policy rate by a total of 325 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.79,0)">It now stands at 1%, a historical low not only for the ECB but also for the national central banks that were its predecessors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.3,0)">Money market yields at longer than overnight maturity have fallen even more strongly than the policy rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">This is important because it means that a crucial element of the monetary policy transmission mechanism is intact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.86,0)">Borrowers in the euro area directly benefit from the low level of six-month and twelve-month money market rates because these are widely used by banks to set floating rate loans to households and companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is particularly true for Spain where floating rate loans are widespread, for example with respect to mortgage loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Enhanced credit support Let me now turn to the exceptional policy actions that we have taken in response to the crisis – the so-called “non-standard” measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">As already mentioned, when the very significant stress in interbank markets first manifested itself in August 2007, the ECB immediately stepped into the breach and accommodated the temporarily elevated liquidity demand from the banks through a fixed rate operation with full allotment, providing €95 billion to the market within a few hours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.94,0)">Overnight lending of the same kind continued to be provided albeit with lower volumes during the following three days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">So we can say that the ECB was the first central bank in the crisis to engage in non-standard measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.11,0)">Liquidity management measures When in mid-September 2008 interbank trading came to a virtual halt, the ECB had to engage in a new mode of liquidity provision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">We started to provide refinancing well above the levels that banks had absorbed to fulfil their reserve requirements in normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me explain to you how and why we did this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">There are three main building blocks to our new liquidity management approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">1) Our primary concern was to maintain the availability of credit for households and companies at accessible rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">We significantly adapted our regular operations in the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Since then, we have followed a new “fixed rate full allotment” tender procedure and we have significantly expanded the maturity of our operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Banks have been granted access to essentially unlimited liquidity at our policy interest rate at maturities of up to six months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">On 7 May we decided to lengthen further the maturity of our refinancing operations, introducing a new one-year operation, the first of which will take place the day after tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">To appreciate fully what these changes mean, let us step back for a moment and look at what we do in normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In normal times, we auction a given amount of central bank credit, mainly in refinancing operations with a one-week maturity, and let competition among bidders determine the interest rate at which that credit will become available to the banking system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.04,0)">This means that the liquidity injection is restrained by a policy decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.66,0)">Last autumn, we changed that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.14,0)">As the demand for liquidity by individual institutions expanded abnormally and markets dramatically ceased to allocate liquidity, we have turned that practice around.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">We have been determining the lending rate – at a very low level – and we stand ready to fill any shortage of liquidity that might occur at that interest rate for maturities of up to six months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This means that we currently act as a surrogate for the market in terms of both liquidity allocation and price-setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">2) The second building block of our new liquidity management approach is the list of assets that we take as collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">This list was already very large before the crisis, but we have enlarged it even further and now accept an even wider range of securities as collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.52,0)">Government securities account for only 44% of the nominal value of securities on the list.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.0,0)">The rest are private securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">In contrast to many other central banks, the ECB already intermediated private paper before the crisis and we have even strengthened this aspect in the crisis by accepting an even wider range of private paper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The total value of these eligible securities is currently €12.2 trillion, equivalent to 130% of GDP in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This very ample eligibility of collateral has dramatically eased banks’ liquidity constraints during the crisis and, ultimately, it has encouraged them to extend new credit or continue rolling over maturing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">3) The first two building blocks offer unlimited refinancing against a very wide range of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">But they can only reach the financial system if they are coupled with the third building block, namely the very large number of counterparties that have always been able to take part in our refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Even before the crisis, 1,700 counterparties fulfilled all relevant criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">This number was higher at the time than for the other major central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Following the changes to our operational framework in October 2008, this number rose even further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Our measures to safeguard the banking system’s access to liquidity have resulted in a considerable expansion of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet, which reached a peak of 19% of GDP at the height of the crisis around the turn of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Since then, we have seen liquidity flows moving back from our balance sheet to the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">This is a sign of improving confidence and more favourable conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We therefore see some indication that the functioning of the money market is improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Covered bond purchases Another unconventional element was added in May: outright purchases of covered bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">This measure complements the liquidity management measures I have just described.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Covered bonds are debt securities issued by banks, which give them access to funding of a longer-term nature than the ECB’s refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Covered bonds thus allow banks to manage the maturity mismatch between their assets and liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Why did we decide to engage in purchases in this particular asset class?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Several reasons guided our decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">First, as I have already stressed, in the euro area measures to support the flow of credit to the non-financial sector need to operate first and foremost through banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.49,0)">Covered bonds were a major source of funds for banks in the euro area before the intensification of the financial crisis last autumn, when the covered bonds market virtually shut down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The Governing Council came to the conclusion that the Eurosystem could help in reviving this market, in terms of liquidity, issuance and spreads, by engaging in outright purchases of covered bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.4,0)">Already after the announcement of 7 May, and before we carried out any purchase, there has been a wave of new issuances of covered bonds and a degree of compression of spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">This is true in particular for Spanish banks, which traditionally have been significant issuers, but also for banks from countries where covered bonds were much less widespread.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.23,0)">The effects on liquidity are expected to take place when the actual program will be conducted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let me stress that our purchases – like all our other policies – target the euro area as a whole and not any particular country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Our purchases will benefit not only banks that issue covered bonds but also banks that are holding these assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">More importantly, beyond banks, our purchases will benefit the real economy, which obtains funds through the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Second, covered bonds are different in nature from the variety of asset-backed securities that had become so popular before turning sour with the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Importantly, covered bonds do not involve a transfer of the credit risk of the underlying assets from the issuer to the investor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The credit risk stays with the originator, preserving the incentives for prudent credit risk evaluation and monitoring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">We could thus say that covered bonds are incentive compatible while many asset-backed securities were not, at least in the way the concept was implemented before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In the years preceding the crisis, banks tended to favour the issuance of asset-backed securities over the issuance of covered bonds, because this form of finance appeared cheaper in an environment characterised by heavy underpricing of credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Given that the financial crisis clearly exposed the dire consequences of this underpricing, the usefulness of more conservative asset classes such as covered bonds, which have proved to be safe assets over time is obvious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">I believe that covered bonds and asset-backed securities will both contribute to a thriving capital market, each catering for a different set of investors and issuers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Last but not least, the ECB’s measures for enhanced credit support were designed in full respect of the euro area macroeconomic framework, which is founded on a clear division of tasks and policy responsibilities between the ECB and the national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.0,0)">Financial support measures potentially involving a significant transfer of credit risk from financial institutions to the taxpayer clearly fall into the realm of fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The decided outright purchases of covered bonds are fully consistent with this fundamental principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">While they are expected to be effective in supporting credit, these purchases do not burden the Eurosystem with excessive credit risk and therefore do not limit our flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Before concluding, allow me a few words on the challenges facing the Spanish economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Over the last decade the Spanish economy has shown a very strong performance in terms of output and in particular employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Spain disposes of some world-class companies in important sectors including energy, communications and banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.86,0)">Spain has been hard hit by the reassessment of risks in the financial sector and the overall change in economic sentiment since the intensification of the global crisis last autumn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.68,0)">The Spanish economy also faces some specific challenges, stemming in part from macroeconomic imbalances which have developed over many years and the related sharp reversal of the housing and construction boom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">For many years strong growth in domestic demand led to relatively high inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.41,0)">The persistent inflation and labour cost differential with the average of the euro area during the expansion has hampered competitiveness which will have to be regained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.15,0)">The present situation suggests a need for labour market reform and wage moderation in particular by discontinuing wage indexation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Appropriate structural reforms will support a sustainable economic upswing and also the consolidation of public finances, which will be crucial not only in Spain but in the entire euro area, for confidence to be restored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.09,0)">Conclusions As I noted at the beginning of this speech, the current environment is clearly much more challenging than it was five years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">At that time the question was whether economic recovery in the euro area was sufficiently robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.63,0)">Currently, we are still in the downturn phase – a downturn that globally is proving to be the deepest since the Second World War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.26,0)">While there are first signs that the pace of economic weakening is decelerating, we must remain alert.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.7,0)">We are in uncharted waters, and there are still risks of a sudden emergence of unexpected financial turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">This being said, the overarching aim must be to restore confidence, to take measures that will solidly anchor the expectations of households and companies, and to lay the groundwork for a return to sustainable prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">This calls for a bold yet solidly grounded response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">We must maintain the balance between the need to take immediate action commensurate with the gravity of today’s situation, and the equally undeniable obligation to return to a path that is sustainable in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The ECB for its part will do all that is necessary to continue to be a very solid and reliable anchor of stability and confidence in these challenging times.</span>
