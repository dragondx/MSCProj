    <h1> Monetary policy in a fragmented world </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the 41st Economics Conference of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Vienna, 10 June 2013 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Benoît Cœuré </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)"> Monetary policy in a fragmented world Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,at the 41st Economics Conference of the Oesterreichische Nationalbank,Vienna, 10 June 2013 Ladies and Gentlemen,   It is a great pleasure for me to speak here today at the Oesterreichische Nationalbank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.16,0)">In my remarks, I would like to address an issue that central bankers don't consider as central to their role even though it attracts much public attention: the distributional consequences of central bank action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,80.23,0)">More than five years have passed since the financial crisis started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.68,0)">This period has been a time of particular economic hardship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.36,0)">The recession and the subsequent sovereign debt crisis in the euro area have been accompanied by rising unemployment, lower incomes and reduced household wealth as house prices have dropped in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.6,0)">But the pain was not evenly shared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.51,0)">Between 2007 and 2010 the distribution of income widened in OECD countries and poorer households have been hit harder, especially in several euro area countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Taken together, these developments are a source of great concern to all Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.45,0)">To be clear, the central bank’s mandate is not to address rising inequalities or to steer the distribution of income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.99,0)">In fact, the use of explicit redistributive monetary policy tools, such as credit controls, was abandoned decades ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Since then, central banks have been granted goal independence and assigned a clear mandate to keep inflation low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">To borrow from T. Padoa-Schioppa, monetary policy is mandated to focus on stability rather than equity or efficiency  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.96,0)">In the given framework, the distributional consequences of monetary policy are temporary, unintended, with a view to safeguarding price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.78,0)">Ensuring a fair distribution of income and consumption, or promoting economic justice for society as a whole are issues that lie outside the realm of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.98,0)">They are the tasks of other economic and financial policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.52,0)">Since the beginning of the crisis, monetary policy has been acting, however, in a fragmented world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.78,0)">And the fragmentations were along different fault lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.93,0)">In the euro area, fragmentations had a horizontal dimension  , a vertical dimension   and a spatial dimension  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.49,0)">And they have significantly impaired the potency of our standard monetary policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.26,0)">The crisis measures of the ECB have accordingly acted on the horizontal, vertical and spatial transmission impairments of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Most importantly, our measures have prevented catastrophic outcomes for the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.57,0)">And these outcomes would have had the biggest impact on the weakest in society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Does all this – as the conference title asks – imply a changing role for central banks in macroeconomic stabilisation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.54,0)">The answer is no.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Monetary policy should aim at preserving price stability, the primary mandate given to us by the EU Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">With regard to the objective, there are no differences between monetary policy in normal and crisis times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Only the intensity and the choice of instruments might require an adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Affecting intra-temporal and spatial allocations should remain the responsibility of governments and other authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Rather than being redistributive, central banks in a fragmented world should aim at repairing monetary policy transmission, and restoring thereby the distributional neutrality of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I will structure my remarks along three lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.51,0)">First, I will describe the distributional consequences of monetary policy and the channels through which monetary policy can affect the distribution of income in normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Second, I will consider the crisis period and the role of non-standard monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And finally, I will look at the role of other economic and financial policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.66,0)">Distributional consequences of monetary policy in normal times Back in the 1960s, monetary policy in western European economies had explicit and legal redistributive functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">For example, central banks used credit control measures to complement more traditional instruments consisting of quantitative ceilings on lending rates or controls over the volume of bank lending to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Direct control over credit was thought at that time to better stabilise economic cycles and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Yet credit controls were also used for other policy purposes, such as to finance government debt at lower interest rates than markets would allow, and to foster the allocation of credit to specific sectors considered as priority activities – in short, to pursue an industrial policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.55,0)">Central banks came to realise that credit controls were not the best way to fulfil their stability objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.41,0)">What’s more, they came with undesired side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.57,0)">In particular, quantitative credit ceilings were negatively affecting competition, innovation and efficiency in the banking sector  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.25,0)">In some countries, the use of credit controls as one of the main instruments of policy led to a rapid expansion in the money supply, persistent inflation and frequent balance of payment crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.68,0)">Today, central banks conduct monetary policy by altering the short-term interest rate to affect inter-temporal decisions on consumption and savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This inter-temporal – or vertical – redistribution is at the heart of the monetary policy, which aims at price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.17,0)">A change in the policy rate is transmitted to other interest rates at various maturities through a long sequence of inter-temporal arbitrages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.05,0)">Ultimately, any change in interest rates for consumers and firms affects saving, investment and spending decisions through an inter-temporal substitution effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.96,0)">Monetary policy also affects the distribution of income on the intra-temporal – or horizontal – dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.72,0)">Changes in short-term interest rates impact on consumption, savings and wealth in different ways, depending on the characteristics of individual households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.8,0)">But all these effects can be considered as temporary, indirect and unintended, that is, a side effect of a strategy which aims at ensuring price stability in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.32,0)">So let me briefly describe how monetary policy can, in principle, affect the distribution of income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me start with the impact over the short term before taking a longer-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.48,0)">Over the short term, we can see three main channels through which monetary policy may have distributional consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.21,0)">First, monetary policy may act upon the cyclical component of the distribution of income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.79,0)">In fact, income distribution may narrow during an economic expansion and widen during an economic contraction, especially if labour markets are not functioning well and the burden of adjustment is disproportionately felt by outsiders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.71,0)">Just think of the case where, for example, an increase in unemployment and a decline in the labour force participation are felt excessively by low-skilled workers  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.93,0)">Hence, this cyclical pattern of the income distribution would imply that an expansionary monetary policy shock would also contribute to a narrowing of the income distribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.83,0)">Second, an unanticipated surge in inflation will lower the real value of nominal assets and liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.13,0)">This tends to redistribute wealth from lenders to borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.41,0)">As a majority of net borrowers are in the lowest part of the income distribution, an expansionary monetary policy shock would help to narrow the income distribution  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.77,0)">Third, a monetary policy shock may impact on the price of financial and real assets by affecting interest rates and expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.14,0)">The distributional consequences depend on asset ownership patterns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">In general, households in the highest percentiles of the income distribution tend to have greater financial wealth and a larger share of income derived from financial assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.39,0)">If an expansionary monetary policy has positive wealth effects, it would lead to a widening of the income distribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">In the same vein, if financial markets are fragmented, an expansionary monetary policy may contribute to widening the income distribution by redistributing wealth from individuals who do not trade in financial markets to those who trade frequently in financial markets and tend to have higher incomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.27,0)">On the other hand, however, a decline in house prices is hurting low and middle-income households disproportionately, as their wealth tends to be concentrated in housing  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">So what about the empirical relevance of these various channels?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.44,0)">Most studies   find that the impact of monetary policy on the income distribution via lower unemployment of low-skilled workers is more important than the redistributive effects from unanticipated inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.33,0)">This means that monetary policy, by stabilising economic fluctuations, indirectly affects the cyclical variation of the distribution of income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">A recent study based on the new Eurosystem Household Finance and Consumption Survey indicates that monetary easing during the crisis allowed a substantial decline in the debt burden of mortgage-holding households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.17,0)">This was particularly so in euro area countries under stress, as well as for some disadvantaged groups of households, such as the unemployed and those with low income or temporary labour contracts  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.14,0)">Still, these effects are all temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.65,0)">It was Knut Wicksell who, in his pioneering work “Interest and Prices”, illustrated the inability of monetary policy to permanently affect output and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">His concept of the “natural rate of interest” distinguishes between the market rate of interest, set by the central bank, and the natural rate of interest that would balance investment and saving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As long as the market rate is less than the natural rate, firms and households want to invest and spend more, causing prices to rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Such a cumulative inflation would continue until the central bank raises the market rate to match it to the changing natural rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.48,0)">Wicksell’s analysis ultimately suggests that the real forces driving the underlying natural rate of interest are outside the control of the monetary authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.85,0)">What does that imply at the current juncture?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.73,0)">Since monetary policy cannot permanently affect the inter-temporal price of saving, savers who are concerned by the low level of long-term real interest rates should worry less about accommodative monetary policy than about the development of structural factors, such as productivity, which are beyond the control of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.84,0)">Does this imply that monetary policy has no long-run or permanent effect on the distribution of income?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.11,0)">Certainly not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In fact, in the long run, monetary policy can control inflation, both its level and variability, as well as the variability of aggregate demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In this regard, price stability can foster a more even distribution of income through several channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.12,0)">First, high inflation generates uncertainty and discourages investment  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.87,0)">The associated reduction in wages relative to the return on capital would contribute to widening the income distribution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.79,0)">Second, the uncertainty and reduced effectiveness of financial markets caused by inflation and macroeconomic instability reduces investment in human capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.34,0)">Third, inflation and macroeconomic instability may harm poorer households disproportionately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.44,0)">This is because poorer households, which have limited or no access to the financial system, are unable to smooth consumption in response to adverse income shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.46,0)">In addition, poorer households tend to hold a larger fraction of their financial wealth in cash, implying that they are particularly vulnerable to higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.54,0)">Finally, inflation and macroeconomic volatility may harm some sectors of the economy disproportionately, such as manufacturing or export-oriented industries, in which wages tend to be relatively lower.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Overall, monetary policy aimed at low inflation and economic stability is the most likely to lead to greater social equality over the longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In this sense, “compassionate monetary policy is, most likely, simply sound monetary policy”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.43,0)">Monetary policy during the crisis Over the past five years we have experienced the deepest recession in euro area countries since the end of World War II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.61,0)">The associated fall in activity was unprecedented: at the trough reached in June 2009, euro area nominal GDP had declined by almost 5% on an annual basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.18,0)">The recovery has been sluggish for the euro area, which is now experiencing a double-dip recession, with growth expected to recover only gradually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.73,0)">The implications for the distribution of income cover the three dimensions which characterise the allocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.28,0)">On the vertical   dimension, the income and wealth losses of the existing generation are severe  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.7,0)">In addition, young people are those most affected by unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.2,0)">To take two examples, youth unemployment in Spain was at 55% and in Greece at 57% at the end of 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.26,0)">This seriously affects the lifetime income and wealth prospects of this group and may cause a “lost generation” to emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.53,0)">Not only is unemployment an immediate social loss, but it is a stressful life event that reduces individual well-being in many persistent ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.14,0)">On the horizontal   dimension, small and medium-sized enterprises   and low-income households were hit hardest by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.73,0)">Wage cuts and income losses, for example, have been the largest for low-skilled, low-wage workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">According to Eurostat, the dispersion of disposable income in the euro area as measured by its Gini coefficient has risen by more than 3% between 2005 and 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.92,0)">Recent ECB surveys show how SMEs and households reported increasing financing obstacles, with bank loans becoming harder to obtain  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.51,0)">In addition, recent data suggest that SMEs, if they can obtain a loan, face higher costs of bank lending than large companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">In fact, interest rate spreads on SME loans compared with those for large non-financial companies have widened to an average of 40 basis points since 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Finally, the crisis has brought to the fore the spatial   dimension.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.74,0)">Euro area countries suffered different fates during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.58,0)">We have observed sharp cross-country dispersion in the cumulated changes in real GDP since the start of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.28,0)">In 2012, real GDP was around 20% lower than in 2007 in the country most affected, while it was around 10% higher in the country least affected by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The cross-country dispersion of unemployment has also widened, with latest unemployment rates ranging from 4.8% in Austria to 27% in Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.11,0)">Spatial inequality has been magnified by the adverse feedback loop arising from the close association between banks and their sovereign, which has led to fragmented financial conditions across countries and, at the height of the crisis, to fears of a euro break-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.35,0)">In particular, banks’ funding costs have remained persistently high in some countries despite cuts in the ECB policy rate, implying heterogeneous financing conditions for households and firms across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">This was also shown by the increasing reliance of banks in stressed countries on Eurosystem funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.51,0)">Widening TARGET2 imbalances – that is, large intra-central bank positions – is a well-known symptom of these developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.97,0)">So what did the crisis mean for monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.66,0)">First, we saw impairments to the traditional inter-temporal arbitrage mechanism, which has curtailed the effectiveness of our standard monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.85,0)">Second, horizontal and spatial fragmentation – that is, impairments across banks, markets and countries resulting from structural impairments and from the adverse feedback loop described above – have challenged monetary policy operating with a single instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Furthermore, we observed a self-reinforcing relationship between the spatial- and inter-temporal dimensions of fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.12,0)">For example, the lack of liquidity in the interbank market impaired the price-finding mechanism along the yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.46,0)">As a result, our monetary policy impulses were not evenly transmitted across countries or adequately along the yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.91,0)">How should monetary policy be conducted in such a fragmented world?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">First and foremost, monetary policy should aim at repairing the transmission of monetary policy by reducing the fragmentations in the economy and restoring distributional neutrality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.73,0)">Does this imply fundamental differences between monetary policy in normal and crisis times?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.54,0)">The answer is no.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Monetary policy acts within the same stability mandate, following the same long-term objectives as in normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.12,0)">It is only the choice of instruments and the intensity of monetary policy action that differ.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">In this respect, it has been argued that reducing fragmentation can imply a redistribution of risk in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.66,0)">For example, by relaxing collateral requirements for their lending programmes, central banks can insure against a tail event in which the borrower and the collateral fail to cover the borrowed amount.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The main insight here is that redistribution of risk is not a zero-sum game, but that the overall risk in the economy, in our case in the monetary union, can be reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">I agree with this view, but I would also like to stress that any such insurance provided by the central bank should come with appropriate safeguards to mitigate moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Let me explain how the ECB acted in the crisis and how monetary policy in particular has alleviated the fragmentations in the euro area following the principles outlined above.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.01,0)">First, in the wake of a widespread confidence crisis following the collapse of Lehman Brothers which threatened to produce very adverse economic outcomes with strong reductions in output, deflationary spirals and high unemployment, we made a series of policy rate cuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.33,0)">These limited the consequences the downturn could have had on the income of households and firms across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Our more recent rate cuts have narrowed the interest rate corridor between the deposit rate and our main policy rate to 50 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.03,0)">These rate cuts have further eased the financing conditions of borrowers in the euro area and they have contributed to a decline in the cross-country heterogeneity in funding costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Banks from stressed countries which participate most in Eurosystem liquidity-providing operations will benefit from the lower interest rate charged for these operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This will, over time, translate into reduced financing costs and improved access to credit for households and firms in stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.1,0)">Second, apart from standard monetary policy, the ECB has also resorted to a number of non-standard measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">By re-directing credit to those segments where financial intermediation ceased to function, the non-standard measures supported those areas most in need and thereby countered the increasing heterogeneity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The announcement of outright monetary transactions   in particular has played a crucial role: it has improved the transmission of monetary policy by removing the “tail risk” arising from redenomination concerns in certain euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Overall, while our non-standard measures were designed for the euro area as a whole, their use has varied among counterparties and across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">In this regard, our non-standard measures restored the distributional neutrality of our monetary policy by mitigating distortions in certain stressed asset classes or sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Their impact has prevented very adverse economic outcomes for certain sectors and countries, and because of the effect this would have had on the rest of the euro area, it has thereby also supported medium-term price stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Today we are clearly seeing signs of improvement in financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.6,0)">Spreads in sovereign and corporate debt markets have fallen substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Deposits placed by the euro area money-holding sector with banks in stressed countries have increased by about €200 billion since August 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.17,0)">As a consequence, borrowing from the Eurosystem has declined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.36,0)">TARGET2 balances of the national central banks in these countries have fallen by more than €250 billion since their peak of around €1.09 trillion in August last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">And these improvements largely reflect the removal of fears of a systemic collapse of the monetary union that were previously being priced in by markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">They also reflect the reintegration of euro area funding markets, against the backdrop of a continuing adjustment effort by participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.12,0)">Falling TARGET2 balances are the best proof that the distributional consequences of non-standard monetary policy measures are unintended and temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.34,0)">The role of other economic and financial policies Economic divergences and heterogeneity remain high in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.58,0)">This concerns in particular the fragmentation in some markets and diverse and weak loan growth across participating countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">While monetary policy in this situation has alleviated the severity of the downturn, let’s not forget Wicksell’s insights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.89,0)">Monetary policy cannot alter the level and distribution of income in a durable way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The distortions at the heart of the current vertical, horizontal and spatial fragmentation can finally only be addressed by adequate economic policies outside the realm of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Indeed, other stakeholders have to take the leading role by continuing to address the underlying structural weaknesses that are affecting our economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Let me mention three policy areas that I consider fundamental in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The first policy realm relates to policies aimed at the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Governments and financial sector authorities need to further encourage the repair of banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Banks in the euro area finance the backbone of our economic system: households and small and medium-sized companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">The decision to establish a European Single Supervisory Mechanism   is an essential institutional step overseeing such a process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The SSM will contribute to greater financial integration, a level playing field and greater financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">It should be complemented by a unified European framework for bank resolution and recovery, and with a Single Resolution Mechanism with the authority to wind up banks in a timely and impartial manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">To complement this, further efforts are essential for banks to build up sufficient capital, remove legacy risks from their balance sheets and to make these balance sheets fit for lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Repairing the financial sector is the best way to ensure that the debt crisis does not bear a permanent impact on income distribution, and hence that it does not impose a permanent constraint on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The second policy area that I would like to mention is fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It is normally the role of fiscal policy   to deliver any income distribution that society would like to implement based on a normative prior.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.31,0)">It is normally the role of fiscal automatic stabilisers to cushion the economic and distributional impact of a deep economic recession of the sort we are experiencing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.01,0)">I say “normally” because we are not in normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.41,0)">Fiscal imbalances and weak sovereign balance sheets have prevented fiscal policies from cushioning the large and protracted financial and economic shocks of the past five years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The lesson from this is clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.39,0)">Running excessive fiscal deficits at the expense of future generations can be very costly in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Therefore, maintaining sustainable fiscal budgets is a necessary condition to achieve distributional equality, both inter-temporally and intra-temporally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me finally mention the structural economic policy domain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Structural policies are key to making an economy more flexible so that it can optimally and rapidly respond to negative economic shocks and avoid the higher costs in terms of lost output and higher unemployment associated with the slower and more protracted adjustments made by rigid economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It is designed in such a way that it curtails rent-seeking behaviours in labour, product and capital markets, structural reform will not only unleash competition and innovation but it will also temper the distributional and social consequences of the needed adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Structural labour market policies are a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.38,0)">They can help to prevent labour market adjustments from falling disproportionately on outsiders, including the younger generation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude by listing the main arguments put forward in my remarks: First, the role of monetary policy is clearly defined in the EU Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The ECB has been mandated by the people of Europe to maintain price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Fulfilling this mandate means preserving the value of money over time and contributing to overall economic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">This has the effect of shielding the lowest-income groups and maintaining living standards for the entire population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Therefore, monetary policy is neutral with regard to fairness and the allocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">But this neutrality can only be ensured if monetary policy transmission is not impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Second, and as a result, monetary policy in crisis times should aim at repairing monetary policy transmission by reducing fragmentations in the economy and restoring thereby distributional neutrality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There is, however, no fundamental difference between monetary policy in normal and crisis times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The intensity and the choice of instruments in a crisis might need to be adjusted, but monetary policy should continue to act within the same stability mandate and following the same long-term objectives as in normal times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Third, the ECB’s monetary policy actions have offset market dislocations and thereby contributed to restoring distributional neutrality during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">In particular, non-standard measures have helped to eliminate tail-risks and, together with the standard measures, have prevented very adverse outcomes for the euro area that would have hit in a disproportionate way the weakest in society, and put at risk price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And finally, despite the temporary relief brought by our policies, there are limits to what monetary policy can do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Steering income allocation within countries and across countries is the responsibility of elected governments and other authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Important work has been done, but in the current environment it is essential that euro area governments continue their reform efforts, individually and jointly, keeping in mind the need to curtail rent-seeking behaviour and protect the weakest in society.</span>
