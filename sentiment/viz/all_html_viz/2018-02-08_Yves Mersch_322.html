    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.08,0)"> Virtual or virtueless?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.68,0)">The evolution of money in the digital age Lecture by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum, London, 8 February 2018 European folklore warns of the will-o’-the-wisp, a malignant creature that dwelt in marshes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.37,0)">It would appear as a light in the distance, which a traveller would mistake for houses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.98,0)">As they reached the place where they thought the light was, it would move further ahead, drawing them deeper into the marsh to their untimely death and a watery grave.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.99,0)">In some areas, will-o’-the-wisps were said to mark buried treasure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.13,0)">Investigation of the phenomenon found it was related to dissipating bubbles of marsh gas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.28,0)">With the draining of marshes to make way for agricultural land, will-o’-the-wisps are rarely sighted nowadays.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But there remain plenty of distant flashing lights to distract travellers with promises of riches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.89,0)">As with the previous incarnation, these flashing lights often turn out to be just like bubbles of marsh gas – insubstantial and foul-smelling, but also flammable and sometimes able to burn things around them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.19,0)">The most recent beguiling wisps are named variously “cryptocurrencies” – to denote the use of cryptographic methods and technology – or “virtual currencies”   – to denote their lack of legal recognition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">There are, at present, more than 1,500 VCs in circulation, with dozens of new schemes being launched monthly, including initial coin offerings  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.41,0)">Most have failed to attract users, in particular in the major currency areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.89,0)">The total value outstanding has fluctuated sharply, largely from speculative activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The global value of all VCs is currently around a fifth of the value of all euro banknotes in circulation and around 3% of the narrow monetary aggregate M1.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.84,0)">Of course, these figures are probably already out of date, such is the volatility of the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.97,0)">Having a million dollars’ worth of Bitcoin today would have required the simple investment of three million dollars in mid-December.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.88,0)">Because holders can hide their identity and location, it is impossible to accurately analyse VC circulation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.46,0)">But euro-related activity on exchanges represents a small share of global activity, and is concentrated on a small number of users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">While VCs remained an esoteric interest, it seemed sufficient for authorities to mostly observe and issue warnings here and there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.31,0)">But it is the dose that makes the poison.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Now that VCs may grow to be economically significant, we need to reduce the risk of negative impacts on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In my remarks today, I wish to explain what it takes for something to be considered “money” – and how VCs measure up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I will then set out what I believe are some of the key regulatory questions that need addressing, and actions that need to be taken to mitigate the potential blowback from VCs to the rest of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.67,0)">What is money?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Money has formed an integral part of human economic interaction for millennia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.95,0)">It has appeared in many forms – metallic currency, paper notes, cowry shells, cigarettes and even the great Rai stones of Yap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.61,0)">Are VCs the latest incarnation of money?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The answer for now, and indeed for the foreseeable future, is no.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Economists generally define money as being a verifiable asset that fulfils three basic functions: a medium of exchange, a unit of account and a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">How well do VCs carry out those functions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Medium of exchange Some VCs have attained patchy acceptance as a medium of exchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.46,0)">The current largest, Bitcoin, is accepted by some retail outlets, but on a global scale these outlets remain small in number, and hardly any actual transactions have taken place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">On a daily basis, there are around 284,000 Bitcoin transactions globally, compared with 330 million retail payments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.06,0)">Indeed, a recent Bitcoin conference stopped receiving payment in Bitcoin because of the cost and time involved in processing the payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.15,0)">Bitcoin is far inferior to existing payment options.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.9,0)">Bitcoin transactions generally require confirmation from six miners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.24,0)">With each block taking around ten minutes to mine, you would expect transactions to take an hour to process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.05,0)">But with recent network congestion, the average time for one confirmation can easily exceed several hours.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.42,0)">At these speeds, if you bought a bunch of tulips with Bitcoin they may well have wilted by the time the transaction was confirmed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.86,0)">Bitcoin payments are also expensive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.24,0)">The recent cost of a Bitcoin transaction is €25, the same cost as carrying out 12,500 transactions on the incoming TARGET Instant Payment Settlement  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Bitcoin is heavily resource intensive, and certainly not a green technology.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Bitcoin mining is estimated to currently consume energy at an annual rate of 46 TWh,  approximately 35 times the electricity consumption of all Tesla cars in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">In comparison, traditional payment services have made large strides in innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The instant payments scheme SCT-Inst was launched in November 2017 and the Eurosystem will implement the TIPS service in November 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">A key characteristic of the instant payments scheme is that funds are made available to the beneficiary in, at most, 10 seconds for 0.2 euro cents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">In TIPS, we aim to settle those transactions within a fraction of a second, in central bank money, with Europe-wide reach and interoperability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">So it is with conventional technology, not with VCs, that genuine progress is being made in payment processing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.19,0)">Unit of account The second function of money is acting as a unit of account, without which buyers and sellers would have to know how many chickens an iPhone would be worth, how many iPhones would buy a house, and so forth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.98,0)">Such a system quickly becomes complex: just ten products already have 45 bilateral pairs of prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.02,0)">Money simplifies the comparisons of value between products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.52,0)">VCs fail this test – none of them are generally accepted as a unit of account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A unit of account is like a flag or an anthem, a representation of commonness backed by assets and values which is even accepted beyond the territory of legal tender.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.88,0)">In part this is due to the lack of widespread recognition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.98,0)">VCs are not legal tender, and are not backed by a central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.69,0)">Retailers accepting such assets as payment undertake notable risks, including potential expropriation by hacking or by an enforced rollback.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.93,0)">But the lack of acceptance as a unit of account is also down to the final function of money – being a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.6,0)">Store of value Wild fluctuations in the value of VCs mean that businesses pricing in VCs could find themselves with a large and detrimental gap between their actual price and their optimal price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">A stable value is required to underpin effective pricing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">Similarly, households benefit from being able to optimise their spending over time by saving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">To do so, they need an effective store of value that they can be sure will enable them to buy goods and services in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.7,0)">When there is considerable uncertainty around how many goods and services an asset can buy in the future, or indeed whether it can be used to purchase anything at all, it is a poor store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Traditional currencies have a trusted issuing authority that acts as a guarantor of the stability of the currency, and a legal framework that punishes counterfeiters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">The ECB’s mandate for price stability, bolstered by the treaty provision for independence, provides consumers with the confidence that the purchasing power of their euro will remain stable from year to year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.32,0)">The political capital the leaders of the euro area’s countries invested during the crisis to confirm the integrity of the euro proved all sceptics wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There are no equivalent structures in place for VCs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.98,0)">They have neither intrinsic value, such as the commodity content of gold coins, nor extrinsic value, such as the value assigned to traditional fiat currencies by the trusted public issuing authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.28,0)">VCs do not even provide the dividend or coupon payments that tie down the prices of equities and bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.16,0)">They are in fact a classic Keynesian beauty contest,  where investors buy what they perceive others view as the most attractive investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Like in Mr Ponzi’s schemes, those investors hope for future price gains and believe they will find a greater fool to sell to before the inevitable crash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.68,0)">Under these conditions, VCs exhibit wild fluctuations in value, meaning that they cannot be trusted as a store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.41,0)">It is this failure, more than any other, that makes the label “currency” a misnomer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Public versus private provision of money Having a widely accepted unit of account and medium of exchange helps smooth economic transactions, reduce costs and enable some interactions to take place that would not be possible under a pure barter system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There are clear network and scale effects with money, which provide one justification for public issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Even Milton Friedman recognised this, noting that “a moderately stable monetary framework seems an essential prerequisite for the effective operation of a private market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It is dubious that the market can by itself provide such a framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Hence, the function of providing one is an essential governmental function on a par with the provision of a stable legal framework.”  But that does not mean that private sector money is either impossible or undesirable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Forgotten amid the hype surrounding VCs is that a widely accepted form of private sector digital money already exists: bank deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.42,0)">This private sector money dwarfs the amount of public sector money – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">cash – in circulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">In November 2017, euro notes and coins in circulation amounted to €1.1 trillion, compared with the €17.5 trillion deposited by euro area residents with MFIs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Certainly this private sector money acts as an effective medium of exchange and, a few episodes aside, as an effective store of value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.29,0)">But such private sector money is not truly independent; it shares its unit of account with the official currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The implicit promise underlying bank deposits is that customers can redeem them whenever they wish and one to one with public sector cash, if they need a safe refuge in a time of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">By providing liquidity to the banking sector and acting as lenders of last resort, central banks de facto recognise this private sector money, even if it is not legal tender.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">But that recognition comes with obligations – including regulations on capital, liquidity, anti-money laundering   and counter terrorist financing  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">For VCs to cross over into the mainstream, regulatory acceptance is necessary, and that acceptance requires equivalent measures for governance and legal certainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Potential impact of virtual currencies Yet even if VCs are not money, central banks should still be aware of the potential risks they pose for price stability and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.1,0)">The magnitude of such risks depends on the total value of VCs outstanding, their interconnectedness with the rest of the economy, and the extent to which investors in VCs are leveraged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.3,0)">In terms of interconnectedness, the main concerns would be if a significant crash caused losses of wealth that were large enough to affect consumer behaviour, or caused contagion through the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The bursting of the tech bubble in 2000 provides a useful comparison for the first scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.35,0)">The market valuation of the NASDAQ fell by around $5 trillion between March 2000 and October 2002, roughly 20 times the current total value of VCs outstanding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">How holders of VCs consume out of their perceived wealth and how much is built on leverage are crucial to determining the impact of a crash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.53,0)">Until recently, VCs have lacked perceptible connections to the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.98,0)">Regulatory requirements on the use of certain types of money or settlements, the high risk of money laundering associated with the lack of customer identification, the speculative pricing of VCs and the limited liquidity are some of the reasons why regulated institutions have refrained from getting involved in this asset class.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.26,0)">Yet there are signs that greed has weakened their resolve and some have begun to form tentative linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">A number of derivative products pertaining to VCs have recently been launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.22,0)">There is rising activity in euro at VC exchanges and some jurisdictions are falling over each other to issue licences to largely unregulated platforms and exchanges in a misplaced competitive race.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.02,0)">What happens if this trend continues and VCs become more commonplace as settlement assets in some niches of financial markets?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.16,0)">What if credit institutions start developing larger exposures to these assets?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.59,0)">What if retail investors take out mortgages to buy VCs?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Amid the growing risks of contagion and contamination of the existing financial system, regional regulatory solutions have to be explored while we await an outcome from G20 discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Indeed, we ultimately need global answers in the absence of a defined jurisdiction for VC issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This is crucial to safeguard the integrity of financial sector services, avoid the undue mutualisation of risks, protect investors and consumers and prevent negative spillovers to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Resolute ring-fencing measures might be needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.84,0)">Reviewing and updating legislation in a timely fashion is a continuous challenge, yet inaction could be perceived as condoning VCs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.82,0)">The four broad areas that require particular attention are: VCs themselves; the facilitators – VC exchanges, wallet-providers and brokers; financial market infrastructures  ; and, the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.16,0)">Regulating virtual currencies Beginning with the VCs themselves, it is clear that they cannot be directly regulated or overseen in the absence of a centralised governance and legal framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.59,0)">In fact, most VCs are “mined” peripherally by a computer programme explicitly to prevent any legal entity being in control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Recognising their limits here, most countries tolerate the usage of VCs, without trying to ban them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Many regulatory bodies and central banks have issued warnings, and this is certainly important from a consumer protection viewpoint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Retail investors need to understand the predominantly speculative nature of VCs and the risks they entail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.42,0)">Statements regarding returns on investment in VC-related advertisements targeting potential investors should be under the same level of scrutiny as advertisements for financial products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">In the United States, awareness of the growing inherent risks to investors and consumers is on the rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The Securities and Exchange Commission  , which oversees the US investment industry, warned in a letter sent last month to two trade groups that, “there are a number of significant investor protection issues that need to be examined before sponsors begin offering these funds to retail investors.” The SEC outlined more than 30 questions that had to be answered before it would give the green light to mutual funds and exchange-traded funds   that invest in Bitcoin and its peers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.96,0)">The concerns refer in particular to the establishment of Bitcoin ETFs, some of which even use leverage to amplify the price movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.33,0)">The extreme volatility in recent months highlights the large degree of speculation involved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.47,0)">Likewise, the lack of liquidity is concerning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.73,0)">If many investors want to withdraw their money from the ETFs on a particular day, the funds might struggle to meet the redemptions because they would struggle to sell off their atypical assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.52,0)">And how would such funds deal with cases of market manipulation, as have happened in the past?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Clarity on such aspects is vital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the same vein, relevant market authorities should monitor, analyse and regulate the use of ICOs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">An ICO is a way of raising money from the public, often to start a project or to finance a company, using coins or tokens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In an ICO, an entity issues newly created coins or tokens and offers them in exchange for fiat currencies, such as the euro, but more often VCs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In 2016, the total amount of funds raised through ICOs was less than €82 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This number has dramatically increased to over €3 billion raised through ICOs in 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Potential explanations for the increasing popularity of ICOs is that they allow companies to raise funds without ceding control to venture capital investors, or enduring the rigour and expense of an IPO process involving a legally binding prospectus, among other things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.87,0)">Depending on their features and characteristics, ICOs can be regarded as either the issuance of VCs, as utility tokens to access or purchase a service or product, or as securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.18,0)">In the latter case in particular, clarification is needed on the extent to which ICOs should be bound by existing regulations, such as on disclosure and prospectuses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This is particularly relevant when tokens are exchanged for fiat money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Restraining the facilitators Let me turn to the facilitators of the spread of VCs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.88,0)">Vigilance is warranted in view of the repeated incidents, most recently the hack of the Tokyo-based VC exchange Coincheck, where €430 million of virtual currency was stolen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,139.71,0)">Although there is no specific evidence to confirm the suspicions, security experts are increasingly warning that VCs could offer rogue states a route to circumvent sanctions and gain access to foreign currency and world markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The ECB takes an active role within our mandate, for example our opinion on the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive, which will extend the scope of obliged entities to cover exchanges and wallet-providers handling VCs, in order to avoid anonymous transfers into fiat currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The ECB reminded the EU legislative bodies that they should not be perceived, through regulatory forbearance, to be promoting VCs, and should take VCs’ inherent stability risks into consideration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">But we need a broader perspective on regulatory intervention for VC facilitators that extends beyond the fields of AML and CTF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Possible regulatory action should be explored, as well as amending or broadening existing frameworks such as the revised Payment Services Directive   so that the licensing and supervision rules also apply to VC facilitators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Protecting financial market infrastructures Third, I would like to cover financial market infrastructure services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.11,0)">One could envisage a major incident involving VCs triggering contagion from the market infrastructure services themselves to their participants, and even beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Against this background, we have to review whether the regulatory and oversight tools in the field of trading, clearing and settlement require updating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">One of the key questions is whether VCs could become a settlement asset in payments and settlement services or be used in the clearing domain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.63,0)">Existing standards for FMIs, for example, refer to the usage of “a settlement asset with little or no credit and liquidity risk ”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.28,0)">While it could be argued that this by and large excludes settlement involving VCs in payment systems, it should be borne in mind that this definition currently does not systematically apply to all FMIs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The situation is similar in the field of securities settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The question is whether VCs could be used as an asset for settling securities transactions or constitute a security per se.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The answer hinges on whether they could be legally characterised as “financial instrument/financial asset” under the applicable regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Certain authorities have already qualified VCs as financial instruments or commodities and this may prepare the ground for the issuance of some specific VC-related products, including derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.77,0)">VC derivative activities need to be fully transparent and records must be collected, maintained and made available by trade repositories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The use of VCs at central counterparties   should also be monitored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The European Market Infrastructure Regulation   states that a CCP shall accept highly liquid collateral with minimal credit and market risk to cover its initial and ongoing exposure to its clearing members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">While it is doubtful that a VC would meet such a requirement, clear guidelines ex ante would be helpful, and financial stability considerations will need to be taken into account by the relevant authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.8,0)">In my view, it should be examined whether any VC activity carried out by FMIs must be ring-fenced from their other activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.19,0)">The enforcement of segregated accounts and liabilities could be discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">FMIs play an important role in financial markets, and any liquidity support offered by central banks should be to mitigate shocks emanating from the real economy, not from gambling in risky assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.91,0)">Certainly, FMIs should not be obliged by legislation to provide settlement services for VCs and VC-related products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.36,0)">In the same vein, the Eurosystem market infrastructure services – TARGET2 and TARGET2-Securities – cannot grant access to VC business according to their existing framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.71,0)">Regulating credit institutions Finally, we need to look at the banking sector, whose profitability and stability might be impaired by VC activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">EU credit institutions are already required to have adequate frameworks in place to assess the capital they need to cover the nature and level of risks they are, or might be, exposed to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Given the volatile nature of VCs, it could seem appropriate that any trading in VCs would be backed by adequate rates of capital, and segregated from their other trading and investment activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Any VC business of credit institutions needs to be rigorously supervised to ensure that risks emerging from such activities are contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This includes ensuring that proper protocols are in place to meet obligations under AML and CTF regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.68,0)">Furthermore, given the risks posed by leverage, credit institutions should not accept VCs as collateral, or only accept them with haircuts that appropriately reflect past volatility, liquidity, and market and operational risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Likewise, limits on leverage could be examined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Central bank issuance of digital currency The advent of VCs has triggered suggestions that central banks should provide central bank digital currency, or digital base money  , as I have previously called it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">DBM already exists in terms of the reserves of the banking sector held at the central bank, but the more recent question is whether central banks should make DBM more widely available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As with every central bank policy decision, any such move would need to be both necessary and proportionate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">There would need to be a clear motivation within our mandate to issue DBM, and such issuance would need to be done in a way that did not bring about risks and costs that exceeded the benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is important to avoid being beguiled by the flashing lights of novelty and assuming that, just because a technology is new, it is also better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There is no material evidence that abolishing cash will inhibit crime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Electronic storage and transfer may well prove easier for criminals than banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.6,0)">I’m also uncertain why cash is being singled out; mobile phones and cars are also used in crime, but there are no calls for their abolition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Moreover, there does not appear to be a global trend towards a cashless society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">A recent study conducted by the ECB finds that around 79% of all payments at point-of-sale were made with cash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Indeed, the demand for cash in the euro area currently outstrips the rate of nominal GDP growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And people who currently prefer electronic payments already have a wide range of options available, without needing the central bank to provide the digital money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A further argument for introducing DBM and abolishing cash is framed in terms of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Several authors have proposed DBM as a way to eliminate the effective lower bound on interest rates, and impose much more negative interest rates than are currently possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">But such rates are not necessary; the unconventional measures put in place by central banks over the past decade have proven sufficient to meet the challenges of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.85,0)">And while sharply negative interest rates may work well in some macroeconomic models, unforeseen changes in real-world behaviour by households and businesses could inhibit the effectiveness of this tool and achieve nothing more than the destruction of confidence in central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Whether this would work to the advantage of private moneys with large disorders in exchangeability remains to be seen from a social welfare point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The decision on issuing DBM also needs to be assessed in relation to the impact on the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">During a systemic banking crisis, holding risk-free central bank issued DBM could become vastly more attractive than bank deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.68,0)">There could be a sector-wide run on bank deposits, magnifying the effects of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.28,0)">Even in the absence of a crisis, readily convertible DBM could completely crowd out bank deposits – putting the existence of the two-tier banking system at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.48,0)">In this situation, the efficient flow of credit to the economy would likely be impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.48,0)">The central bank – now holders of deposit funding – would have to decide which projects were financed, either directly by replacing commercial banks, or indirectly by deciding which banks received funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is an undesirable situation for European central bankers for two reasons: Legally, the Treaty provides for the ECB to operate in an open market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">And, by the same logic, we are well aware of Friedrich von Hayek’s warnings about “the pretence of knowledge”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Decentralised market decisions are the “first choice” when it comes to allocating resources in an optimal way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.71,0)">This includes the allocation of credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.07,0)">Overall, there is currently no convincing motivation for the Eurosystem to issue DBM to the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.28,0)">It is unnecessary at present and, when the likely negative impacts on the financial system are taken into account, such a move appears disproportionate to the aims put forward by its proponents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There is no need to fix something that is not broken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">If anything, one could imagine a digital representation of cash that replicates the features of cash in the reasonably distant future, if citizens demanded it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.18,0)">Such an approach seems more appropriate for jurisdictions whose currencies face domestic regress as they are also not widely accepted beyond their territory – which is certainly not the case for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.86,0)">Virtual currencies are not money, nor will they be for the foreseeable future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.87,0)">Their market share is still small and their ties to the real economy are still limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.84,0)">But this can be subject to change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Regulators and legislators on all levels should therefore urgently pay close attention to mitigating the potential risks that could stem from growing VC business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It is not unknown for new innovations to bring about euphoria and hype, which in turn fuel bubbles that eventually burst.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And indeed, the hot air is already escaping from some of these bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But just because the initial euphoria and hype subsequently fade, it does not mean that the innovation is without virtue, even if early market leaders may not last the distance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Despite the many defaulted railroad bonds, railways are a common mode of transport today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">From London you can even take a train directly to many parts of Europe through the Channel Tunnel – whose now profitable operator filed for bankruptcy protection in 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Netscape and AltaVista were titans in the early days of the internet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Web browsers and search engines are still with us, but those names are no more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">So it may well prove with VCs.</span><span style="background-color:
