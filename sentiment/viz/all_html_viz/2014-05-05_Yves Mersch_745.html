    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)"> Institutional overhaul of the euro area – progress and remaining challenges Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at a conference organised by the Association Européenne de Droit Bancaire et Financier Luxembourg, Luxembourg, 5 May 2014 Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be with you today to discuss the institutional overhaul of the euro area, a few days ahead of the “Europe day” commemorating the Schuman declaration of 1950.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Introduction: From Schuman to Delors With this declaration, Robert Schuman set the path towards the creation of the European Coal and Steel Community, the first of a series of supranational European entities that would ultimately become today's European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">The aim of this initiative was clear from the outset, as put in Schuman’s words: “In this way, there will be realised simply and speedily that fusion of interest which is indispensable to the establishment of a common economic system; it may be the leaven from which may grow a wider and deeper community between countries long opposed to one another by sanguinary divisions”  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Less than forty years later, the Delors report which laid out the rationale and framework of Economic and Monetary Union followed a similar logic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Beyond its economic motivations, the introduction of the euro had also a political dimension: by setting up a common Economic and Monetary system, the founding fathers of the euro strived to create a deeper community among euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Due to the severity and duration of the current economic crisis we tend to forget that the euro – as a broader political project – has been and remains very successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The geopolitical turmoil at the doors of Europe reminds us that political stability and security should not be taken for granted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.79,0)">This does not mean that the title of today’s conference has lost its relevance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">On the contrary: the crisis has shown that in order to reap all the economic benefits of the euro – and more generally of the Single Market –, a number of reforms have been necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In adopting these reforms, a delicate, yet essential equilibrium has to be found between those who wanted to follow the path of further integration and those wishing to remain outside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But both dimensions, the euro area on the one hand and the broader EU on the other hand, are not incompatible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Indeed, a strong Single Market is essential for a well-functioning single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Reciprocally, putting the euro area on a stronger footing is important for the euro area itself but also benefits the countries that do not share the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">At the eve of the European elections, it is good to assess the concrete progress achieved in the last five years in the field of the institutional architecture and common set of rules for the euro area and the EU at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">In the immediate future, it is of crucial importance to implement the new legislation as thoroughly as possible, both at European and national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Only then will Europe be able to provide stability, growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Looking at the next legislature, further legislative action is necessary to complete the Single Market for financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">In the longer term, reflection is warranted on how to further develop the institutional framework of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The EU, and the euro area in particular, has drawn the right lessons from the financial and sovereign debt crisis The crisis has painfully brought to light the shortcomings in the implementation of the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">First of all, it was believed that European rules, together with pressure from the financial markets, would be sufficient to ensure fiscal discipline on the part of Member States while budgetary competences remained at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.56,0)">Second, the emergence of macroeconomic imbalances was not monitored sufficiently as coordination of economic policies was considered to be a secondary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.65,0)">Third, there was no coherent strategy in terms of harmonisation of rules and surveillance of the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.88,0)">Finally, no European crisis management framework was in place when the sovereign debt crisis struck.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">However, the crisis has provided the occasion for the euro area, and the EU at large, to equip itself with new instruments to address these weaknesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Two key principles have guided the crisis response: self-responsibility and solidarity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">In line with the first principle, the six-pack, the two-pack and the Fiscal Compact have made the economic and fiscal governance framework more commensurate to the requirements of a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The Commission and the Council now dispose of tools and procedures to allow for the early recognition and correction of excessive macroeconomic imbalances and unsound fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Most importantly, the new framework is completed with a set of more automatic sanctions in the event of a Member State deviating from agreed benchmarks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In line with the second principle  , Member States have created a crisis management framework to deal with Member States losing market access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">With the European Stability Mechanism   and the two-pack, both a permanent funding instrument and a governance framework have been created.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">A few days ago, the ESM has reached its target level of €80 billion in paid-in capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The exit by Ireland and Portugal from their EU/IMF programme shows that reform efforts and sacrifices are bearing fruit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Beyond these economic governance reforms, and reflecting the lessons drawn from the financial crisis, significant progress has been achieved with regard to financial sector policies, both in the EU as a whole and in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">First, in the late 2000s it became clear that the financial sector had to be put on a safer and more resilient footing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">To this end, EU legislators adopted the Capital Requirements Regulation   and Capital Requirements Directive   in April 2013: this was an essential step towards strengthening the stability of the banking sector and thereby preventing future crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">More recently, the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive   was agreed upon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">To comply with the new rules of the BRRD, banks across the EU will have to develop in a harmonised way recovery plans, cooperate with resolution authorities and make necessary changes to capital holdings, business activities, legal and operating structures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Finally, harmonised standards for deposit guarantee schemes have been introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The four pieces of legislation just mentioned apply to the financial system in the EU at large: this is key to ensure a level playing field within the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Taken together, these new rules constitute the ground floor of the European “house” for financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The euro area Member States decided to build an additional floor in this common house by creating the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">They are currently in the process of setting up powerful institutions for the supervision and resolution of their banks at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Many will agree with me if I say that this project is the most significant step forward in the integration of European financial markets since 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">It is an indispensable complement to the single currency and should contribute to addressing the adverse feedback loop between banks, public finances and macroeconomic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">It should also help to reduce the fragmentation of euro area banking and money markets and thereby facilitate the transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The first element of the banking union, which is the Single Supervisory Mechanism, will soon be fully operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">On 4 November this year, the ECB is set to start directly supervising about 130 significant banks in all euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">All smaller banks will continue to be supervised by national supervisors, however subject to the single supervision framework enacted by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">We are working very intensely to meet this deadline, together with the national competent authorities in all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In order to ensure a clean and sound start, the ECB has also designed a comprehensive assessment to restore the health of the banking sector and confidence in it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">As announced by the ECB on 29 April, banks will be expected to cover capital shortfalls within six to nine months after the disclosure of the results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">The EBA will be closely associated to this exercise which has to be fully in line with the Single Market to ensure that the EU financial system as a whole will be revitalised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Let me also say a few words about the second element of Banking Union that has been agreed in March: the Single Resolution Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The SRM, together with the rules of the BRRD, will provide a comprehensive framework allowing banks to be wound down in an orderly way in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.11,0)">If the resolution of a bank requires additional resources after bail-in, they will not come from public budgets but from a fund that will be financed by the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.16,0)">Such a system will shield taxpayers from having to pay again for the mistakes made by private banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Both elements of the banking union remain open to Member States which do not share the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In other words, any co-owner of the house willing to participate in the construction of the additional floor is welcome to join.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Forming part of strong and unified institutions for supervision and resolution clearly have direct benefits also for Member States that have not   joined the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Those wishing to stay on the ground floor are free to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">At the same time, I see it is very much in their interest that a solid floor is being built upstairs as they would immediately feel the consequences of a weak construction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.09,0)">The crisis has shown that financial instability in the euro area can negatively affect non euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Of course, safeguards have to be implemented to ensure consistency between this new construction and the ground floor – and thereby stability and harmony in the whole house.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This is what has been done with the revision of the EBA regulation simultaneously with the adoption of the SSM regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The banking union project is about reinforcing, not dividing, the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.75,0)">However, such safeguards, which do have a bearing on the design of euro area integration, should not prevent euro area members from taking the decisions that are necessary for the smooth functioning of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">To sum up, a lot has already been done over the past five years to draw the lessons of the financial and sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.15,0)">But this is not the end of the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As most of you are lawyers, you know very well that once legislation has been enacted, implementation by the relevant authorities is equally important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">At the European level, the agreed tools and procedures have to be fully enforced by the Commission and the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This applies in particular in the field of economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At the national level, Member States have to adjust their domestic regulatory framework to the new European environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Enjoying the benefits of being part of the banking union should come together with the adequate responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In some cases, the timeline for implementation is ambitious and requires speedy and determined action by national authorities: for example, the main provisions of BRRD need to be transposed until 31 December 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.4,0)">A number of Member States, including smaller ones, have to close a number of outstanding gaps and loopholes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Further legislative action is necessary to complete the Single Market for financial services Let me now turn to the next five years and the legislative agenda for the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">I see a number of areas where further progress is required in order to complete the Single Market for financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">This would benefit all 28 Member States: if I may use again the metaphor, solidifying the walls of the ground floor is in the interest of all co-owners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But it may be even more important for those involved in the construction of the additional floor, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.12,0)">the euro area Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Two major legislative proposals which are highly symbolic for citizens as an EU response to the crisis are now on the table and need to be carefully analysed against their potential benefits and drawbacks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Let me mention first the Commission’s proposal on structural measures for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">A few years after the start of the crisis, assessing the banking sector’s structure and reflecting on how to make banks safer is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">A coherent approach would contribute to reducing the potential fragmentation caused by different national structural regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Nevertheless, the devil is in the detail when implementing such reform, especially because the potential benefits are still untested.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Second, in a different domain, the ECB shares only some of the objectives that have motivated the proposal for a Financial Transaction Tax  , for example further integration of the single financial market and increased financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">However, as you know, the FTT is currently discussed among only 11 countries which have decided to enter into an “enhanced cooperation” on that specific issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As all Member States will not be part of this arrangement, it should be ensured that the planned tax would not have unintended side effects such as hampering the transmission of the single monetary policy and the smooth functioning of settlement systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In particular, a coherent approach with countries which are not part of the enhanced cooperation is vital to avoid regulatory arbitrage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The crisis has also spurred discussions on how to better bring the financial sector back to its core mandate: being at the service of the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">I strongly believe that more can be done to unlock affordable financial resources for European SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">As 99.7% of firms in the EU are SMEs, euro area economies’ well-being is intertwined with the financial health of SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">By assisting banks’ ability to fund and distribute risk the securitisation of SME loans could contribute to connect the financing needs of SMEs with the funds of investors who would otherwise not invest in those SMEs..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Looking forward, at least three steps are necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">First, more work should be done to distinguish ‘high quality’ segment of the ABS market and make them more robust to market stress, thereby providing banks with a more resilient form of funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Second, available data and general standards applied to all ABS should be further improved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Third, the regulatory treatment of securitisation should be revised to better reflect the risk-mitigating features of high quality securitisation and to address current inconsistencies in the legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">More generally – going beyond the notion of banking union, we should work towards creating an integrated financial market union that supports the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">This requires in particular two elements: developing cross-border capital markets offering a real alternative to banks’ financing; and ensuring that banks are able to operate smoothly across borders and to undergo mergers and acquisitions without any national bias.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.89,0)">In this context, let me also focus on what is often referred to as the plumbing of the financial sector, that is, the Single Market for payment and cross-border securities settlement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Harmonisation is key to ensure that both the Single Market and the single currency function smoothly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The ECB has delivered an important contribution in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.5,0)">In the early 2000s, the Giovannini reports identified 15 barriers to efficient clearing and settlement across national markets in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.66,0)">For quite a long time, there was no progress in removing these barriers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This is about to change significantly with a common settlement platform and a common set of rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">TARGET2-Securities   will go live in June 2015 and will be the common securities settlement platform of 24 CSDs, both inside and outside the euro area, for settlement in central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The CSD Regulation will enter into force in early 2015 and complement from a regulatory perspective what the single platform T2S ensures from a technical perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Harmonisation is also essential with regard to retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">This is an area where citizens can see the tangible benefits of the Single Market in their everyday life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Soon, we will migrate to the common European schemes that have been developed for credit transfers and direct debits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.21,0)">Whether you make a bank transfer within Luxembourg or from Luxembourg to, say, Finland or Portugal, this will not make any difference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The recent proposals of the European Commission for a revised Payment Services Directive and for an Interchange Fee Regulation should also be adopted swiftly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">When implemented, they will significantly enhance integration in the market of card payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">That said, a lot remains to be done, including in the field of technical standardisation, to support that objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">How to develop further the institutional framework of EMU Allow me now to go beyond the area of financial sector policies and take a broader look at the future of the EU and in particular of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In 2012, the Report by the four Presidents of respectively the European Council, European Commission, the Eurogroup and the European Central Bank identified four building blocks of a genuine EMU: banking, fiscal, economic and political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The banking crisis made the first building block, the “house” I referred to, a priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">However, we must not forget that much remains to be done on the three other construction sites.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In the longer term, it seems appropriate to reflect on the limits of the current framework in which we are evolving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">A Treaty change could enlarge our horizon of possibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">As regards fiscal union, the Four Presidents’ Report mentioned the need for true oversight over national budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.86,0)">The consequences of misguided fiscal policies in a monetary union are too severe to remain self-policed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.89,0)">Beyond the recent reform of fiscal governance, the euro area centre could be endowed with veto rights over those national budgets that violate the European rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">As regards economic union, the euro area needs to achieve a higher degree of economic convergence, in terms of competitiveness, growth potential and flexibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">This is essential for each individual country and for the smooth functioning of the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The framework for policy coordination should be made more stringent and enforceable at European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">At the same time, due attention should be paid to fostering national ownership of the necessary reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Progress in these fields would require commensurate steps towards political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In view of the multiple geometries implied by the EU integration process, the need for an enhanced political dimension is even more pressing for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Sharing a single currency implies a substantial sharing of sovereignty and economic integration, going well beyond the requirements of a single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">There are a number of possible options to enhance effectiveness and legitimacy of decision-making in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">For example, a permanent Eurogroup President as the nucleus for a euro area Finance Ministry with proper analytical capacity and more autonomous decision-making powers could be a step in the right direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">This could be accompanied by stronger accountability towards the European Parliament, in particular for the implementation of the governance framework, for example in a euro-area sub-committee of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Let me conclude by broadening again the scope of our discussion and coming back to the founding declaration of 1950.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Going beyond the establishment of a common economic system, the EU project was from the beginning aiming at creating a deeper community of Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Recent progress in the financial and economic field should not make us forget that citizens also expect Europe to deliver on broader public goods such as internal and external security.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.62,0)">The Single Market and the EU’s “four freedoms”   have brought new challenges for law enforcement authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Moreover, the fragility of external security, especially at the borders of the EU, remind us that, as put forward by Schuman in 1950, “world peace cannot be safeguarded without the making of creative efforts proportionate to the dangers which threaten it”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It requires going beyond the economic foundations of the European project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">“The Schuman declaration”, Robert Schuman  .</span>
