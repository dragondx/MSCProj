    <h1> The policy and the role of the European Central Bank during the crisis in the euro area </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Katholische Akademie in Bayern, Munich, 27 February 2013 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)"> The policy and the role of the European Central Bank during the crisis in the euro area Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the Katholische Akademie in Bayern,Munich, 27 February 2013 Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen, I am delighted to be here in Munich at the Catholic Academy and thank you for this kind invitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As befits this setting, I would like to begin my remarks by noting the momentous nature of the current period for the Catholic Church, on the eve of the last day of the pontificate of Benedict XVI.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Pope Benedict, a great son of Bavaria, used his eight years at the helm of the Church to address a variety of pressing concerns of the modern world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Among them was an emphasis on ethical concerns in the economic relationships of our globalised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.5,0)">Those concerns have become more relevant than ever during the economic and financial crisis that now extends into its fifth year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.56,0)">The crisis has dented people’s confidence in the capacity of markets to generate prosperity for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.96,0)">It has strained Europe’s social model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.66,0)">Alongside the accumulation of staggering wealth by some, there is widespread economic hardship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.44,0)">Entire countries have been suffering from the consequences of misguided past actions – but also from market forces that are sometimes beyond their control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In a sense, the “social question” of the 19th century, which inspired the Catholic Social Doctrine, has re-emerged – but today it transcends national borders: what is the right framework for reconciling free enterprise and individual profit motives with concerns for the common good and solidarity with the weak?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.48,0)">In recent decades, this question seemed to be approached from a purely economic perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">The invisible hand of the market, if only left unconstrained, would eventually generate better outcomes for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.66,0)">The rational actions of ‘homo oeconomicus’ were seen as divorced from ethical concerns about compassion, charity and decency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It seemed forgotten that Adam Smith, the philosophical father of market economics, saw his “Wealth of Nations” as inextricably linked to his “Theory of Moral Sentiments”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.45,0)">Thankfully not everywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">At the Jesuit school in Italy where I was educated, we had a fundamental guiding principle: our striving for excellence had to be paired with integrity and a moral message – an ultimate sense of purpose in the service of social justice and fairness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I have previously noted that “without ethics, there cannot be a genuine development”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.75,0)">We cannot have an economic model that allows excesses to go uncorrected, which relies exclusively on self-regulation of markets and in which individuals believe that “anything goes”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Ultimately, we must be guided by a higher moral standard and a profound belief in creating an economic order that serves every person.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Here I find myself in the company of Marx.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.56,0)">Not Karl, but Reinhard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Cardinal Reinhard Marx has rightly insisted that “the economy is not an end in itself, but is in the service of all mankind.” And caring for the welfare of our neighbours is not only an ethical principle of the Christian faith: it also makes eminent economic sense.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">No-one knows this better than the successful entrepreneurs of Bavaria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.04,0)">Interdependence is not just a catchword.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.85,0)">The economic health of the countries around you affects us here and now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">So these are the challenges facing European policy-makers today: how do we recreate confidence in the capacity of our economies to grow and generate prosperity so that they can ultimately serve the people?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">How do we shape our economic model so that it reconciles individual freedom and social justice?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">And how, as the European Union, do we strike the right balance between the responsibilities of individual countries and those of the Union as a whole?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">How the ECB plays its part Let me begin by focusing on the role of the European Central Bank  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">We have been given a special responsibility by the people of the euro area to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Price stability is the foundation of a functioning economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It is also the basis for a just and fair society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It is a common good for all Europeans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.81,0)">As Walter Eucken, the philosophical father of ordoliberalism, noted, “all efforts to establish a liberal order are futile unless a certain monetary stability is guaranteed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Monetary policy therefore has a primary importance for the liberal order.”   Price stability ensures that the market mechanism works properly, which is the best way we know to create growth, jobs and prosperity for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It preserves the purchasing power of our money and the value of our savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.79,0)">And it has profound social implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.72,0)">Stable prices support the weakest members of our societies – including pensioners and the unemployed – who depend on fixed incomes to live.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In that sense, a stability-oriented monetary policy is a key component of the Social Market Economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.37,0)">I do not say this based on theory: the history of this country has taught us that inflation undermines not only economic wealth but also political stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The deep-seated fear of inflation is therefore more than understandable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Your own national experience is at once a powerful reminder and steadfast obligation for the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The challenges of the crisis But preserving price stability today requires different actions than it did in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">We have required new tools to ensure that our monetary policy decisions are able to reach firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.72,0)">This is because the crisis has severely fragmented the euro area’s financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.87,0)">It has disrupted the way our interest rate changes are passed on by banks to the wider economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.47,0)">As a result, our low interest rates have simply not been getting through to people in some parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.78,0)">This may sound like a technical matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">But the transmission of interest rates is fundamental.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The euro area is a bank-based economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Around three quarters of firms’ financing comes from banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.93,0)">So if banks in some countries will not lend at reasonable interest rates, the consequences are dire.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.18,0)">Perfectly healthy companies would be forced to close.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.49,0)">Credit for new investment would not be available.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.04,0)">Not because business models are flawed or because investment projects are too risky, but because firms happen to be located in the wrong place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.34,0)">Worse still, in the first half of last year fragmentation in the euro area had become so serious that some investors were questioning the future of our currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.8,0)">Fears of a potential break-up were sending capital fleeing from the periphery to the core.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.33,0)">For some in the financial markets, the most fundamental notion of confidence in a currency – that a euro is a euro regardless of where you are – was no longer a given.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But a currency whose integrity is in doubt cannot be a stable currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.59,0)">So we had to decide: do we passively let events take their course and accept severe risks for price stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Or do we assume the responsibility, within our mandate, to defend the stability of our currency and our monetary union?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.15,0)">Those were difficult and existential decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">They required deep reflection, a proper assessment of risks in the short and long term, and a clear-headed judgement of possible alternatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.29,0)">They also required the courage to face the inevitable criticism and engage with those who disagreed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">But we chose to act – because we judged this to be right and necessary to safeguard price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Defending the transmission of monetary policy First, we acted to remove blockages that were stopping banks from passing on our low interest rates to borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">We allowed banks to take as much liquidity as they needed from our operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">We allowed a wider set of collateral that banks could use to access this liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">And we extended the maturity of our operations, going up to 3 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Second, we acted to remove the unfounded fears about the future of the euro area that were undermining the stability of our currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">We launched a new measure called Outright Monetary Transactions   to provide a fully effective backstop in the sovereign bond market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">We focused on this market because it has a “knock-on” effect on other markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.78,0)">Fears in the sovereign bond market were seeping into the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.56,0)">They were paralysing the economy, and ultimately threatening price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">By putting in place a credible backstop, we were able to remove those fears at the source.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.02,0)">Those fears were unjustified by economic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.54,0)">They were the result of market failure: a situation where investors seem to act rationally, but collectively they create destructive outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.96,0)">Countries that were fundamentally adjusting were being driven to the wall by panic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.6,0)">And the result would have been unnecessary hardship and suffering.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Much has been written about this measure, especially in this country, and some fundamental questions have been raised: Is the ECB still independent?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And will the ECB stay focused on fighting inflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The answer to both these questions is a categorical “yes”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">First, we always protect our independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We take all our monetary policy decisions in full independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And we have designed the OMTs so that these decisions could never be dominated by fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">This is why a pre-condition for access to the OMTs is a strong economic adjustment programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It ensures that we would only ever intervene in situations where fiscal discipline is firmly ensured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Second, we keep a permanent watch on inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We understand and take very seriously people’s concerns about possible inflationary threats.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.3,0)">But it is a fallacy to make a mechanical connection between the creation of central bank liquidity and a rise in the money supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The liquidity we provide to banks is used in the markets where banks lend to each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It does not automatically increase credit or money in the economy – and so does not automatically lead to price pressure in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.68,0)">Indeed, money growth is currently well below an inflationary level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.57,0)">Credit provision to the private sector is overall weak, and contracting in large parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">And inflation expectations are firmly anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">So risks of inflation down the road are firmly in check.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The euro area dimension to our actions It is also important to understand that our measures are designed not only to help the people in countries under stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In fact, in line with our mandate, they serve the citizens of the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.43,0)">Many of the financial developments that concern people in this country – such as meagre returns on their savings or large imbalances in the Target-2 payment system – are really only the mirror image of fragmentation in the rest of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.13,0)">As money flows out of stressed countries and into safe-haven countries like Germany, it pushes up interest rates in the stressed countries, and pushes down interest rates here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">These flows cause Target-2 imbalances to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.84,0)">What has not been sufficiently acknowledged, however, is that these imbalances would only affect German taxpayers in the event of a break-up of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">This means that actions by the ECB that protect the euro area against such outcomes – like the OMTs – also reduce hypothetical risks for German taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And this is exactly what we have seen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.07,0)">Since the announcement of the OMTs, the Bundesbank’s Target-2 exposure has decreased by more than 100 billion euros.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">In sum, the ECB has acted, and will continue to act, to fulfil its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">We are committed to preserving the integrity of our currency, in the interests of all people of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.37,0)">We do not act to help banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.73,0)">We do not act to help governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">We act to help maintain the flow of credit to real firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We act to preserve price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.04,0)">Incidentally, while some in this country are wondering whether the ECB does “too much”, elsewhere in the euro area I am asked why the ECB does not “do more”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.98,0)">I just returned from the Spanish Parliament in Madrid – and the concerns expressed there are very different from what I hear in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.73,0)">People worry that a stagnating economy will lead to the emergence of a “lost generation”, where young people have no jobs, and even worse, no hope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">But our answer – both to those who want us to do less and to those who want us to do more – is the same: we will preserve price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This is our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">How governments play their part It is important to stress that the ECB’s mandate only extends so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There are clear limits to what monetary policy can and should aim to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.45,0)">We cannot repair unsound budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.18,0)">We cannot clean up struggling banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.83,0)">We cannot solve deep-rooted problems in the structure of Europe’s economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Our monetary union was deliberately constructed so that these policies would be the preserve of elected governments in each Member State.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Sharing a common currency would only be sustainable if each country assumed its own responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This reflects the subsidiarity principle embedded in our European Treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And in that sense, it also echoes a central tenet of Catholic Social Doctrine.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As Pope Pius XI wrote in 1931, “It is a fundamental principle that one should not withdraw from individuals and commit to the community what they can accomplish by their own enterprise and industry.”   Individuals have to do what they can to help themselves before they seek help from the community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The same is true for the countries in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Fortunately, this is what we are seeing across Europe today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">Governments have already done a lot to tackle the imbalances that accumulated in previous years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Progress in implementing economic reforms has been extraordinary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Deficits are being reduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,119.99,0)">Current account imbalances are being unwound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Wide-ranging structural reforms are underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Particularly impressive is the scale of the adjustment that has taken place in countries receiving financial assistance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.78,0)">In many countries these efforts have largely removed the underlying drivers of the sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">But while sovereign debt markets have improved, bank lending is still very fragmented across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.68,0)">Credit in some countries is still difficult to obtain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">The benefits of the painful actions undertaken so far have not yet materialised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">And this means that economic adjustment is coming at a heavy social cost.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.0,0)">Economists often speak about “inevitable adjustment costs”, which to some sounds cold, heartless and lacking compassion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But we are fully aware of the human dimension that lies behind it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.94,0)">Euro area GDP is currently lower than it was in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.19,0)">Almost 19 million people are unemployed – more than the population of the Netherlands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.16,0)">Unemployment is a tragedy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.35,0)">It squanders the vitality of our workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.09,0)">It prevents people from playing a full and meaningful part in society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.22,0)">It induces a sense of hopelessness, which drains the inspiration from our young.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.07,0)">Reform as the path to growth and fairness Reducing unemployment is therefore a pressing challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.13,0)">Governments need to address the structural problems in their economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">They need to enact fundamental reforms that boost the potential of their economies to grow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">We need reforms that make doing business easier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">That guarantee that those who owe taxes actually pay taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">That ensure that public services actually serve the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">And these reforms should aim not only to create more growth and jobs, but also to make society fairer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Fairness starts within countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.82,0)">In one country in the euro area, more than fifty percent of young people cannot currently find jobs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.01,0)">Is it fair that, as a result, this generation has to bear the bulk of the burden in the downturn?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.58,0)">In another country, an estimated 55 billion euros of tax revenue remains unpaid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.87,0)">Is it fair that, as a result, other people who are taxed on their salaries have to make up the difference?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This is why I say that reforms that make economies work better also make them fairer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And fairness also matters between generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.95,0)">Many countries have to think hard about how they can support ageing populations and generous welfare states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.63,0)">The unsustainable option is to keep increasing debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But this means nothing else than passing the burden onto future generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">There is no real equity through debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">The sustainable option is to generate the higher growth that is needed to maintain Europe’s social model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">And this is only possible by walking the path of determined reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">There is no doubt that this is the hard path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But it is also the courageous path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">It is the path that will create jobs; that will support our social model in the future; and that, in the end, will contribute to a fairer society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.72,0)">For this reason, it is wrong to claim that countries are undertaking reforms only to please the markets or to satisfy the demands of technocrats in Brussels, Frankfurt or Washington.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">They are doing it for their own benefit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">And it is time that this message gets more emphasis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.88,0)">The place for mutual support But what if countries cannot succeed on their own?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The ethical imperative when we see others in need is to help.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">It is to do what we can to limit their hardship.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Should this not also apply within the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Should countries support those in difficulty?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The answer is yes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Catholic Social Doctrine makes absolutely clear that subsidiarity has to be paired with support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">But what binds these together is trust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Trust that each will put its own house in order – even if it is politically difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Trust that each will play by the rules – even if this imposes unpopular choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Trust that each will constrain its sovereignty – even if this means making a break with the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Such trust has to be built through actions, which is a further reason why the process of reform across the euro area is so important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">It shows that countries are ready and willing to be full members of the community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">And this makes mutual support between them possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Certainly, countries in Europe are already doing a lot to help each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">They are providing generous financial assistance on condition that underlying problems are fixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">But in my view, once trust is established, we should go further still.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">We should take stronger collective responsibility over national economic and financial policies, to ensure that countries do not get
