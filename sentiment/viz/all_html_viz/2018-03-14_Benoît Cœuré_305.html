    <span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)"> Making our monetary union stronger and more resilient Speech by Benoît Cœuré, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Finanzmarktklausur of the CDU Wirtschaftsrat, Berlin, 14 March 2018 Let me thank the organisers for inviting me here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Our common monetary policy has been much discussed in recent years, also here in Germany, where the highest court has been asked to examine the lawfulness of some of our measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.97,0)">While the European Court of Justice has confirmed that the ECB has acted at all times within its mandate, many of the institutional failings which caused and perpetuated the crisis, and which contributed to the ECB adopting a series of unconventional policy measures, remain unresolved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.27,0)">These shortcomings are well known.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">When there’s growth and the sun is shining, euro area Member States have few incentives to pursue sound policies and keep their economies productive and flexible enough to prosper in a monetary union on a sustainable basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.48,0)">This leaves them vulnerable when rainy days come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.66,0)">In such an environment, where the governments of the 19 Member States have retained core responsibilities in crucial areas such as fiscal policy, business environments and labour market policies, the central bank can quickly become a scapegoat or be the focus of unrealistic expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.93,0)">Worse, there is hardly a single European public discourse in which the common monetary policy can be communicated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.04,0)">Take the title of this panel as an example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.08,0)">The connotation that people attach to the term “Nullzins” will likely be different from, say, “geldpolitischer Impuls” – although both terms in essence describe the same thing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.18,0)">Worse, monetary policy can quickly become overburdened if national fiscal and economic policies fail to internalise the effects they have on the common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The temptation to free-ride is always present in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.34,0)">It is easy to see that if fiscal policy is loosened during an expansion, or tightened during a recession, the burden on the central bank to stabilise the economy increases mechanically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.39,0)">Even today, euro area growth still relies too much on monetary policy support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">According to ECB staff estimates, the contribution of our easing measures to annual euro area GDP growth was half a percentage point in 2017 and will still be around one-third of a percentage point in 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">And monetary policy can do little to lift the long-term growth rate of our region.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">All of this means that our currency union needs further reform – both at Member State and euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">I believe there is wide agreement on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Where we still lack agreement, however, is on how these reforms should look in practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I have described elsewhere the requirements of reform from the perspective of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">As the central bank of the euro area, we have a stake in the success of the current discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.53,0)">Without further reforms, and depending on the nature of the next crisis, we may well be forced to test the limits of our mandate – a concern that has been voiced by Germany in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">I offered three “lines of defence” that any well-functioning monetary union depends on: flexible markets, adequate national fiscal buffers and a common fiscal instrument to cope with large shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The logic is simple and compelling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Flexible markets for goods, services, labour and capital reduce the need for costly macroeconomic stabilisation and curb contentious debates about crisis management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">They reduce both the likelihood and impact of shocks and allow economies to bounce back more quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.57,0)">And they save much of the precious political capital governments had to spend on acrimonious crisis discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.94,0)">But flexible markets come at a price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.5,0)">In a downturn, they often impose economic hardship on workers through job losses or wage cuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Governments can mitigate these effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.96,0)">Unlike the United States, however, the European Union is not a federation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This means that – as a rule – stabilisation needs first to take place at Member State level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Building and maintaining adequate room for action at national level is therefore essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.49,0)">This is what our fiscal rules are about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">And contrary to common perceptions, this is not only about bringing general government deficits under the 3% line, but it is also about bringing them closer to balance or to surplus in the medium term so that fiscal space can be used in the event of a recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.26,0)">But even ex ante solvent governments can come under pressure in the face of very large shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.31,0)">Absent national stabilisers, such as an autonomous monetary policy and exchange rate, such shocks have already tested the cohesion of the currency union as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">This is why a common monetary policy needs a complement in the form of a common fiscal instrument that can support – under proper democratic control – aggregate demand if need be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Many of the Economic and Monetary Union   reform proposals that are currently being discussed would help bolster these three lines of defence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Enhancing national ownership of structural reform efforts, for example, could help make our economies more agile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">A true capital markets union, leveraging the benefits of fintech innovation, would significantly boost the capacity of our financial markets to diversify and reduce risk, while the ECB has often argued that a European deposit insurance scheme is a precondition for a truly integrated banking system and safe money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">And the Single Market still has a lot of untapped potential, in particular in the field of services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">These should be priorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">More credible fiscal rules and greater market discipline would strengthen the second line of defence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">A nimbler European Stability Mechanism, meanwhile, together with steps towards an area-wide stabilisation budget, could effectively complement the euro area’s institutional architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Reforms along these lines are needed to help us create a more stable and safer currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">A stable, resilient and more integrated euro area is in everybody’s interest, including, and maybe especially so, Germany’s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">That is why Germany for decades joined forces with its European partners to strengthen the European Union, including by establishing a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">It is reassuring to see that the coalition agreement gives strong support to the European project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Indeed, governments and parliaments of Member States, together with the European Parliament, must be the driving force in this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.47,0)">This is particularly important at a time when the multilateral order based on cooperation is being challenged, at a time when one of Germany’s long-standing partners, the United Kingdom, is about to leave the European Union, and at a time when anti-European forces, elected and unelected, in other parts of the Union are calling into question not just the EU’s four freedoms but also the values of an open, free and democratic society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">In this environment, Germany, as one of the founding members of the Union, has a responsibility to promote and nurture a reform debate that is constructive and that will help to bridge differences of opinion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">A strong Franco-German commitment is a necessary condition for moving forward, but all Member States have to be on board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">It means that we should move beyond the north-south divide which has too often shaped past discussions on EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Economic fragmentation is receding on our continent, thanks to a broad cyclical recovery, the ECB’s actions and the bold reforms initiated in several countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.31,0)">We should be careful not to allow political fragmentation to jeopardise these achievements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Ultimately, what matters is that we strike the right balance between solidarity and responsibility and that we embrace a vision which secures the integrity and resilience of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.89,0)">We all know that this is not easy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.09,0)">But failure to do so would leave the ECB alone at the forefront of macroeconomic stabilisation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.98,0)">This is a risk not worth taking.</span>
