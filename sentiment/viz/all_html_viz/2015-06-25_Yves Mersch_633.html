    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)"> On European Unity: Economic and Institutional Challenges Facing Europe Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Discussant Prof. Hannah Scobie, Chairman, European Economics & Financial Centre, European Economics & Financial Centre, London, 25 June 2015 Ladies and gentlemen, David Laidler, the English economist and one of the foremost scholars of monetarism, once stated that “transparency is an asset that depreciates very rapidly, so communication has to be ongoing, and if it is to enhance accountability, it must be a two-way process as well”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">As a central banker, I fully concur with this assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">To explain our monetary policy measures – and to defend them when challenged – has become the state of the art in contemporary central banking communication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The exchange with academia, financial market participants and the general public is the litmus test for how we succeed in managing expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This holds in particular for times of heightened uncertainty and complexity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">That is why I consider seminars like this one an important part of my professional duty – it provides an opportunity to explain the actions of the European Central Bank  , to answer your questions and also to ask some questions of you, in order to benefit from your wealth of experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.61,0)">The euro area in particular has faced many questions since its inception and – as one of the foremost euro area institutions – the ECB has increasingly been drawn into debates that go beyond a very narrow definition of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.53,0)">As a result, a criticism that is sometimes levelled at us is that we spend too much time talking about policies which are outside our mandate – namely structural reforms and euro area governance – and too little time focusing on actually delivering that mandate, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">returning inflation from its current low levels back towards below, but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.42,0)">You will not be surprised that I do not share this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">But the fact that it persists in some quarters suggests that there is a need to explain our position more clearly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Namely, to underline why the ECB has acted in the way it has in response to low inflation, and why we have insisted on others acting in their domains of responsibility as well, both at national level and European levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This is what I would like to do in my remarks today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">There are three points in particular that I would like to address.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Implementing large-scale asset purchases The first point relates to our monetary policy and our decision to expand the APP in January.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.68,0)">While in some quarters this was seen as excessive activism, in others – often on this side of the Channel – it was seen as excessively hesitant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">The argument was that as a price stability-oriented central bank with a symmetric mandate, we should have followed other major central banks and deployed asset purchases sooner to push inflation back to our objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">If one looks at the steps we have taken based on the data available in each period, it becomes clear that we acted based on an evolving medium-term outlook and taking into account the balance of risks at each moment – as any responsible policymaker should.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The process in 2014 that led to the launch of our APP illustrates well this point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.25,0)">At the start of 2014 we were confronted, on the one hand, with a consistent and broad-based downward trend in past inflation, falling from 3% at the end of 2011 to less than 1% at the beginning of 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">But on the other, sentiment on the economic outlook was relatively positive for the year, with nearly all forecasters expecting the recovery to strengthen as the year progressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">In this context, we felt relatively comfortable that the medium-term inflation outlook was secure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">While we were very alert to the risks to that outlook, there was no clear justification for a strong expansion of the monetary policy stance at that time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">Moreover, the use of large-scale asset purchases was unprecedented in the euro area and came with concerns that do not exist in other advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.02,0)">There was more uncertainty about the strength of the relative transmission channels given the euro area’s financial structures; and there was more concern about the possible side-effects and redistributive effects of holding large amounts of government bonds in a monetary union that is not a fiscal union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">All this created a further reason to be patient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In my view, deploying asset purchases had to be an ultima ratio decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.25,0)">We had to see clear evidence of heightened deflationary risks either in the realised inflation data or in the movements of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.53,0)">That evidence started to appear in the summer of 2014 as the macroeconomic situation worsened unexpectedly and the underlying impetus that we saw earlier in the year faded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This removed an important driver behind the reflation scenario we had expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.26,0)">The sharp fall-off in oil prices that began in the late summer added then further disinflationary pressures, feeding also into core inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.05,0)">The result was that, by January 2015, the euro area was experiencing negative headline inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.52,0)">Crucially, there were also material signs that inflation expectations were becoming unanchored, which increased the likelihood that inflation would stay below our objective even when the oil price effect faded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">These data, especially measures of inflation expectations, were sufficiently decisive to warrant our shift to large-scale asset purchases in January this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The prevailing macroeconomic outlook meant that the benefits of deploying that instrument in terms of delivering our mandate now clearly outweighed the costs in terms of potential side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">But by waiting for adequate evidence, had we ended up “behind the curve” in counteracting the disinflationary trend?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.31,0)">In my view the answer is clearly no.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">First, we had taken a series of expansionary measures throughout 2014 in response to the incoming data, including cutting our main refinancing rate to its effective lower bound; introducing a negative rate on our deposit facility; launching our targeted long-term refinancing operations  ; and, importantly, in September 2014, with our decision to begin purchases of ABS and covered bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Second, by communicating clearly the conditions under which we would use large-scale asset purchases – our so-called reaction function – we had already initiated a gradual easing of financial conditions as markets anticipated our measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.58,0)">Long-term nominal interest rates fell by around 100 bps from mid-2014 to January 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Because we were predictable and credible, our policy was taking effect before it was actually announced in January.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Third, even though our measures were partly priced-in, when they were launched the initial impact was stronger than many expected and the response of macroeconomic indicators was quicker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">We have seen strong signalling effects, reflected in rising inflation expectations, a rebound in consumer and business confidence and higher equity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.59,0)">And we have also seen evidence of significant portfolio rebalancing effects, both across assets classes   and across jurisdictions, producing a fall in the effective exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">As a result, the economic recovery has broadened and the June ECB staff projections now envisage inflation to average at 0.3% in 2015, 1.5% in 2016 and 1.8% in 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Our actions have proven timely and provide us, so far, with comfort that the medium-term inflation outlook is secure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Both output and inflation forecasts are broadly balanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">These forecasts are however contingent upon a full implementation of our programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">We intend to carry out our public sector purchases until end-September 2016 and, in any case, until we see a sustained adjustment in the path of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Only once we see convincing evidence that inflation has returned sustainably to levels in line with our objective will we be able to declare success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Monetary policy and structural reforms But this begs the question: if our measures are working well, why do we put so much focus on other policies?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is the second point that I would like to address – why structural reforms are relevant for monetary policy and why it is legitimate that, as a central bank, we take a view on them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.65,0)">In a nutshell, in the euro area, the more divergent economies become in terms of their structural conditions, the harder it ultimately becomes to achieve price stability at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">First, structural reforms have a direct link to inflation, inflation expectations and real interest rates through their effect on the adjustment process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">When a country is hit by a shock, output will be less affected if relative prices can adjust quickly, and the recovery in output will be faster if the economy is able to reallocate resources in a more efficient way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This depends critically on structural features of the economy – for example, how labour markets adjust  , whether product markets are competitive and allow the entry and growth of new firms, and how quickly labour and capital can redeploy to more productive uses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.74,0)">This is related to issues such as the strength of insolvency regimes and effectiveness of active labour market policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.95,0)">How adjustment takes place in turn has implications for euro area price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.16,0)">A fast price adjustment will cause inflation to fall steeply initially, but then agents will expect it to rise again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This ensures a firm anchoring of medium-term inflation expectations and does not affect perceptions of real interest rates going forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.94,0)">A slow employment adjustment, by contrast, will create more prolonged downward pressure on inflation, which is more likely to weigh on inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.59,0)">This in turn can lead to higher expected real interest rates and exacerbates the effect of the shock, thus complicating the achievement of price stability at the euro area level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.57,0)">Second, structural factors can compound adjustment difficulties by affecting the transmission and effectiveness of monetary policy across different countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.67,0)">That is because if economies recover very slowly from shocks, it is more likely to produce financial fragmentation and impair the transmission of monetary policy to those areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.33,0)">For example, a prolonged downturn with higher unemployment will tend to create higher loan-losses for banks, which impairs the bank lending channel of transmission as banks are forced to rebuild their capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.16,0)">Such an economic slump is also likely to worsen the fiscal position for the government, which can further exacerbate fragmentation via the bank-sovereign nexus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Moreover, even if transmission works smoothly on the supply side, structural reforms also affect the demand side: the willingness of entrepreneurs to take on credit for new investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.37,0)">Insofar as structural factors create an unattractive investment environment, they can impede credit demand and thereby hamper the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">By the same token, structural reforms and accommodative monetary policy can be complementary in boosting investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">That would include, at the micro level, opening up protected sectors where there is pent-up investment demand or reducing administrative burdens on entrepreneurship; and at the macro level, lifting expectations of future growth and hence “animal spirits”, especially where firms are constrained by a debt overhang.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.81,0)">This psychological dimension of reforms is particularly important for the euro area given that 5 years ahead growth expectations among forecasters have been falling continuously since 2001, from around 2.7% then to 1.4% today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.12,0)">Third, if due to structural factors shocks leave deep scars on some economies, it can affect the long-term cohesion of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.71,0)">Divergence in structural unemployment is more likely to become entrenched across the Union, which of course cannot be offset, like in other federations, by fiscal transfers between the constituent members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.6,0)">And to the extent that this weakens the political rationale for monetary union – that all members are better off over time inside the Union than they would be outside – it also weakens its long-term cohesion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.58,0)">This undermines the integrity of the currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">The ECB’s interest in structural reforms therefore has two dimensions: achieving an efficient implementation of monetary policy in the short-term, and maintaining the integrity of the currency over the longer-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Both of these feed into euro area price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, our interest is not in how countries implement reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is a national question and there are different models that can work in a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Our interest is in whether they succeed in doing so, as it is this that has implications for the whole euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">It is in this context that we at the ECB have recently called for stronger common governance in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.89,0)">This call reflects the fact that some of the original expectations on how monetary union would function have, I think, now clearly been shown as over-optimistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In particular, when the Maastricht Treaty was signed, it was evident to most policymakers that monetary union would ultimately need to be accompanied by integration in other policy areas too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">But it was widely expected that, following the functionalist logic, sharing a single currency would automatically trigger that integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.69,0)">We know this did not happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.23,0)">And while the role of common institutions, rules and procedures has increased, the institutional equilibrium in the euro area is still fragile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Institutional responses to our economic challenges So my third point is that we need to reflect seriously on the key features of a well-functioning monetary union, and how we can progress towards establishing them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">A lot of progress has already been made in strengthening our rules and institutional architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">We have reinforced our fiscal rules and improved the coordination of our economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">And we have made a huge institutional leap with Banking Union, establishing the Single Supervisory Mechanism   within the ECB and a Single Resolution Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">But we know that the architecture of EMU is not yet complete, and the 5 Presidents’ Report published this Monday describes how to take this process to the next level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Though like Rome a complete EMU cannot be built in a day, I believe we have to be ambitious both in the short and longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">We have to show that we are building a bridge towards a more stable and prosperous union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.61,0)">This is what the report does.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It fleshes out a number of quick-wins that can be implemented in a first stage without Treaty change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The Commission will come forward with concrete proposals on these still this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">And it sets the priorities for more fundamental changes to how monetary union operates in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">The ECB fully supports this process and will continue to actively contribute to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Let me highlight what we see as two crucial aspects of the report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">First, the report makes a strong case for completing Banking Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">It calls for finding a swift agreement on bridge financing and a permanent backstop for the Single Resolution Mechanism  , with the ESM identified as the natural institution to act as a backstop for the SRF, while remaining fiscally neutral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">These measures would help further sever the bank-sovereign nexus, which would in turn complement the functioning of monetary union – by reinforcing the singleness of money within the euro area, and by supporting the even monetary policy transmission across jurisdictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Second, the report advocates a long-term sovereignty shift in both economic and fiscal policies – a ‘move from rules to institutions’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Most importantly, the report calls for a new economic convergence process to make the euro area more resilient against shocks, which would in turn make further sharing of sovereignty in the fiscal domain possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">It also proposes eventually establishing a euro-area treasury to take decisions jointly on certain elements of national budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This is certainly not for tomorrow, but this is the direction our Economic and Monetary Union ultimately needs to move in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In order to maintain the momentum, this process needs to start now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It is now up to the European leaders to reflect on these proposals and carry them forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">As a matter of fact, they are discussing the report at the European Council in their meeting tonight and tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I trust that the wider context will not be lost in those discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Our forceful monetary policy measures were first, necessary, second, timely, and, third, effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The economic recovery is now proceeding at a moderate pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">And we see encouraging signs that it is broadening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Monetary policy accommodation is a necessary condition for the recovery to keep on track.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This implies that we will deliver what we announced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.2,0)">But it is not a sufficient condition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Member states have to do their part.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Structural reforms are needed to strengthen the supply side and help economies regain a competitive edge in a globalized economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">And only with such an increased growth potential will the cyclical recovery become a sustained, structural recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.27,0)">Neither monetary policy nor economic policy takes place in an institutional vacuum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The institutional refurbishment of the European house has so far achieved a lot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.95,0)">But the ambition to do so was often driven by the urgency of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">And now that the worst may lie behind us, we have to keep the momentum of further integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">The 5 Presidents’ report is a useful roadmap for the way ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">A strong commitment to completing Banking Union will ease financing conditions for enterprises sustainably, and increase the resilience of Europe’s financial landscape with a view also to hemming in contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Likewise, a long-term sovereignty shift in both economic and fiscal policies will stimulate convergence towards similarly resilient economic structures, based on common standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Not everything can be achieved today, but all countries agreeing on the same way forward is a key element for higher confidence and a lasting end to this crisis.</span>
