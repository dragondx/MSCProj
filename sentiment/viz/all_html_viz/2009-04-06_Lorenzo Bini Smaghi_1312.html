    <span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)"> The Euro Area's Exchange Rate Policy and the Experience with International Monetary Coordination during the Crisis Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat a conference entitled “Towards a European Foreign Economic Policy” organised by the European Commission Brussels, 6 April 2009 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure to be here today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The title of today’s conference “Towards a European foreign economic policy” could hardly be more topical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Indeed, the world is facing challenges not seen for decades – challenges that are truly global.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The solutions will thus need to be global too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.83,0)">Inevitably, the political power and economic weight of individual states and regions will matter when designing these global solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">If Europe wants to punch in proportion to its economic weight, moving towards a common foreign economic policy is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I have expressed my preference for such a policy on various occasions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">In the area of exchange rate policy – the topic of my speech today – the euro area has already achieved unity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.84,0)">It speaks with one voice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.7,0)">Exchange rate policy is the exclusive competence of the Community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.3,0)">Hence, the individual Member States can no longer act autonomously in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">At the same time, in its resolution of 1997, the European Council stated that “exchange rates should be seen as the outcome of all other economic policies”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.54,0)">This represents a general feature of exchange rate policies, as the exchange rate cannot be determined by one single actor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.51,0)">It always depends on the decisions and actions of at least two parties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Indeed, any bilateral exchange rate depends on the actions and policies of both sides.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Moreover, this rate can also be influenced by the actions and policies of third countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">As a consequence, exchange rate policy is by nature international and needs to operate in a context of international cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The euro area’s exchange rate policy cannot be seen in isolation from those of the US, Japan, China, and many others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.88,0)">The international dimension of exchange rate policy and its implications for global economic stability came sharply into focus during the 1930s, when a series of competitive devaluations plunged the world into an economic depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">For this reason, the Bretton Woods conference assigned a central role to the IMF in the monitoring of exchange rate policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Given the deepening integration of the world economy over the last decade, the IMF decided in 2007 to strengthen its surveillance of exchange rate developments, in particular to ensure that exchange rate policies do not jeopardise the stability of the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Today I intend to cover four items: the implications of the single currency for exchange rate policy, the institutional arrangements for the euro area’s exchange rate policy, exchange rate developments during the crisis and, finally, some other dimensions of international monetary cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">A single currency – a single exchange rate policy What did the creation of the euro mean for exchange rate policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Prima facie, the answer is straightforward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Having a single currency automatically implies having a single exchange rate and thus also a single exchange rate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.26,0)">Yet the repercussions of EMU go beyond these ‘automatic’ consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.31,0)">Prior to EMU, Europe consisted of open and, for the most part, small economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Because of the very large size of the external sector compared with the national economy, the exchange rate played a very important role in the economic performance of these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">The move to monetary union implied the creation of a new economic entity –‘euroland’ – which is much bigger and much more closed than its component states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.72,0)">This obviously reduces the importance of the exchange rate for ‘domestic’ economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.36,0)">In addition, monetary union – by definition – did away with nominal exchange rates between its participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.89,0)">As a result, gone are the days when an economic or financial crisis could also trigger an exchange rate crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">By setting up a bigger and less open economic entity and by eliminating intra-area exchange rates, the euro acts as a shield against external turbulence..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The economic crisis has clearly demonstrated this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In rough financial waters, it pays off to be on a large, solid and stable ship rather than on a small vessel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.88,0)">Size matters in a global world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Allow me therefore to make a bold point: the euro has arguably been the best exchange rate policy decision which Europe has ever taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Institutional arrangements for exchange rate policy in the euro area This brings me to my second topic: the institutional arrangements for the euro area’s exchange rate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In describing these arrangements, we should distinguish between three categories of countries: EU countries which do not take part in ERM II, EU countries which are part of ERM-II, and non-EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">First, consider the EU countries which do not take part in ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As EU Member States, these countries are subject to the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And the Treaty is crystal clear: each country must treat its exchange rate policy as a matter of common interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This obligation should not be taken lightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In fact, it should be taken very seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.36,0)">The question arises whether the single market can function smoothly when the exchange rate is allowed – or even encouraged – to depreciate sharply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Using the exchange rate as an instrument to gain a competitive advantage over others may fuel resentment and stoke protectionist pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It falls upon the Commission and the Council to ensure respect for this Treaty provision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Second, consider the EU countries which do take part in ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">ERM II is an exchange rate arrangement that links the currencies of some EU Member States outside the euro area with the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The framework helps to ensure that euro area candidates orient their policies towards stability and sustainable convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">By simulating some of the economic conditions which exist within a monetary union, ERM II also functions as a ‘training room’ which prepares and helps prospective euro area entrants on their road towards adopting the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Finally, with respect to non-EU countries, the euro area has adopted a flexible exchange rate regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The external value of the euro vis-à-vis the currencies of third countries is thus determined by the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">By adopting this line, the euro area has continued the policy towards third countries pursued by its component countries prior to EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The rationale behind this decision is twofold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">First, the absence of an exchange rate commitment allows the ECB to focus squarely on its euro area objective, which is the preservation of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Second, the creation of the euro implied the creation of a bigger and less open economic entity – the euro area – in which the exchange rate plays a much less influential role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.09,0)">Accordingly, it would have been nonsensical to subject the euro area’s monetary policy to an external requirement – namely an exchange rate target – rather than internal requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The euro area was not alone in adopting a flexible exchange rate regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Most mature economies and some emerging economies also pursue a floating exchange rate regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.33,0)">This begs an important question: if you leave it to the market to determine exchange rates, does this mean that there is no role to be played by policy-makers at all?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.41,0)">The answer is clearly no.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.66,0)">Also countries with a floating exchange rate conduct an exchange rate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.25,0)">There are three reasons for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.08,0)">First, exchange rate markets are prone to episodes of overshooting and undershooting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Public intervention – in the form of public statements or even outright interventions in FX markets – may thus be warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.38,0)">Second, inadequate macroeconomic or structural policies in a neighbouring country may provoke substantial exchange rate movements that have a detrimental impact on the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Again, public intervention may be warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And third, not all countries have adopted a floating exchange rate regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,43.18,0)">These countries may sometimes take steps to prevent the necessary adjustment of their exchange rates, which in turn impacts on economic developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Also here, public intervention may be warranted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This leads me to another question: does the euro area have the instruments and procedures it needs to effectively implement its exchange rate policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Here, the answer is clearly yes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The euro area is fully equipped to implement an effective exchange rate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Such a policy requires four main ingredients: first, monitoring and assessing exchange rate markets and developments; second, discussing market developments with the other major partners; third, making public statements; and fourth, intervening in the foreign exchange markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In practice, the role of the main actors, typically governments and central banks, depends on the precise architecture of foreign exchange policies, as I will explain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The central bank has to be involved, given its economic and technical expertise, but also because any intervention must be consistent with the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.21,0)">Finance ministries are often involved because they own the foreign reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Moreover, the success of exchange rate policies also depends on supportive domestic policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Indeed, regardless of the precise design of competences, all institutional arrangements in this policy field provide for a close interaction between governments and central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let’s now consider these four elements in greater detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Monitoring and assessing exchange rate markets and developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.88,0)">This is not an easy job.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.75,0)">Indeed, there is no fully reliable compass for assessing whether an exchange rate is out of line with fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.53,0)">Moreover, there is no single indicator for exchange rate developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Rather, the indicator to be chosen depends on what we want to find out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">Bilateral exchange rates shed light on the relative movements of the economies of the two countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Yet for many other questions – such as overall competitiveness developments – we need to have a look at the effective exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.39,0)">In the euro area, exchange rate developments are regularly monitored and assessed by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">These assessments are shared, as appropriate, with euro area finance ministers and the Commission in the Eurogroup.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Since the start of the euro, there have been no disagreements at the technical level either on the assessment or on the action to be taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Discussions with the other major partners.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">This is key, since the effectiveness of policy action critically depends on it being coordinated with other relevant countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.52,0)">The euro area conducts such discussions at three levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">First, in the context of the G7, the Presidents of the Eurogroup and of the ECB represent the euro area and are closely involved in the relevant deliberations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Second, discussions on exchange rates also take place at the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">Here, the potential for the euro area to speak with one voice has not yet been fully exploited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A third forum for discussing exchange rate issues is in the context of bilateral relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Progress has also been made on this front, notably by setting up a forum for discussion with the Chinese authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.94,0)">Public verbal interventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.53,0)">Statements of this kind are sometimes made on exchange rates in the context of the G7.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Both the Eurogroup and ECB representatives make a major contribution to the preparation of the relevant communiqués.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The views expressed by the two representatives have always been consistent and ensured an effective message.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Interventions in foreign exchange markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The euro area is fully equipped to conduct – if necessary – such interventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It did so, very effectively, in the autumn of 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This instrument is in the hands of the ECB, which can assess when and how to use it in the light of the prevailing market conditions and its monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">To sum up, the euro area has all the necessary instruments to implement an effective exchange rate policy for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Is there scope for improvement?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">I see three areas where further progress should be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.8,0)">First, there is a need for verbal discipline when making statements on exchange rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.25,0)">Especially in the early years of EMU, public statements on exchange rate developments were too frequently made by individual policy-makers who were not mandated to speak on behalf of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.97,0)">At times, this has undermined the credibility and effectiveness of the euro area’s exchange rate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.91,0)">Only the President of the ECB and the President of the Eurogroup should comment on the exchange rate of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The authorities which are not mandated to speak should heed the adage: ‘silence is golden’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Second, policy-makers should take into account the potential implications of their domestic policies on exchange rate developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Third, the euro area should speak with one voice on exchange rate issues in all international institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">This holds in particular for the IMF, which since 2007 has been enhancing its surveillance of exchange rate policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.86,0)">Even though a single currency implies a single exchange rate, the euro area representatives in the IMF Executive Board do not always sing from the same hymn sheet when discussing exchange rate developments in other major countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">It is my conviction that a unified representation of the euro area countries at the IMF would strengthen the exchange rate policy of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.53,0)">Exchange rate developments during the crisis Let me now turn briefly to exchange rate developments since the outbreak of financial turbulence in the summer of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.21,0)">During the last year and a half, foreign exchange markets have witnessed sharp swings in all major bilateral rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Foreign exchange volatility – both realised and implied – has reached historical levels  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">More recently, the situation seems to have improved as realised volatility eased substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Yet the markets’ perception of risk still remains elevated compared with longer term averages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Despite the extremely volatile environment, the spot foreign exchange market seems to be functioning normally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Looking at the euro/dollar bilateral rate, bid-ask spreads   have remained largely unaffected by the rise in realised and implied volatilities  , and broadly in line with their averages since 2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.13,0)">Nonetheless, some tensions have emerged in the forward foreign exchange market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.36,0)">The US dollar funding needs have led to tensions in global money markets   and forced many institutions to convert euros into dollars through FX swaps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.13,0)">In addition, tensions have not remained confined to the shortest horizons, but also spread to longer maturities, as banks have realised that the financial crisis might last longer than anticipated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.58,0)">Turning to exchange rate movements, until the summer of 2008, the US dollar weakened against the euro, while the Japanese yen remained broadly stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This reflected the market perception that the turbulence originated in the United States  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.21,0)">Subsequently however, and especially after the Lehman collapse, the euro weakened both against the US dollar and the Japanese yen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">The dollar benefited from increasing risk aversion worldwide as well as from temporary factors associated with a widespread shortage of dollar liquidity in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The yen for its part was boosted by falling policy interest rates worldwide and rising financial volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.97,0)">Combined, these factors led to a massive unwinding of the carry trade positions that had been established in the low-volatility environment before the summer of 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.16,0)">On 27 October of last year the G7 issued a joint statement warning about disorderly developments in the foreign exchange of the yen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The Japanese currency stabilised thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Overall, the euro did not record exceptional movements in nominal effective terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">It appreciated by around 5%   between September 2007 and March 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">This appreciation stemmed from significant gains vis-à-vis the pound sterling and other central and eastern European currencies, and was balanced by the euro’s depreciation against the Japanese yen, the Swiss franc and the US dollar  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Notably, in its last report on the World Economic Outlook, the IMF considered the real effective exchange rate of the euro to be on the strong side of medium-term fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Looking more closely at the euro-dollar exchange rate, some observers have expressed their surprise at the appreciation of the dollar against the euro since mid-2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.79,0)">Some considered this appreciation to be at odds with the US-related origin of the crisis, especially the weaknesses in the US financial system, and the persistent – albeit gradually improving – US current account deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">It is said that the recent dollar appreciation can be traced back in part to the markets' perception of the international status of the dollar, playing the role of safe haven in periods of heightened risk aversion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The strong correlation between rising volatility and US dollar strengthening at a daily frequency points in this direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The dollar appreciation at the end of 2008 is consistent with a significant rise in net portfolio inflows into the US  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.18,0)">Tensions have also been visible between the currencies of some of the new EU Member States; indeed, the currencies of most of those countries weakened significantly vis-à-vis the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.67,0)">Beyond country-specific factors, this reflected the sharp deterioration in economic activity and outlook and, most notably, a reversal of capital flows, as a result of heightened global risk aversion and increased home bias.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The functioning of ERM II was overall not adversely impaired, despite the exceptional rise in foreign exchange volatility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Other dimensions of international monetary coordination Apart from exchange rate policy, there are other important aspects of international monetary coordination which have come to the fore in the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">On top of their regular exchanges of information and views, central bankers have engaged in unprecedented joint actions to provide liquidity, reduce financial market strains, and counter negative spillover effects on the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.43,0)">For example, on 8 October 2008 the ECB cut interest rates simultaneously with six other central banks, against a backdrop of lower inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Another example can be found in the area of liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">A key tool in this respect has been the US dollar Term Auction Facility, in which the ECB agreed with the US Federal Reserve to grant loans in dollars to euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">These USD liquidity- providing operations have increased over time in terms of size and number of participants, with a substantial number of central banks now participating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The Eurosystem has also entered into an agreement with the Swiss National Bank in order to facilitate the provision of liquidity denominated in Swiss francs to euro banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Finally, the Eurosystem has signed agreements with the central banks of several European countries in order to improve the provision of euro liquidity to their banking sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Since the start of the crisis, we have therefore achieved a level of trust and cooperation within the central banking community that some would have considered unthinkable a couple of years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">As the ECB President put it a couple of weeks ago, global cooperation by central banks is now mirroring the globalisation of finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Conclusions To conclude, the euro area has an exchange rate policy and it has been implementing it over the last ten years, with full cooperation between the authorities in charge, including over the recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">International monetary coordination has gone beyond exchange rates, and involved several aspects of central banking, including on one occasion a coordinated interest rate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Such coordination is aimed at the specific circumstances of the crisis and has helped to restore confidence in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Having said that, financial and economic conditions do differ across the major countries, and we should not expect that coordination means uniformity of action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Monetary policy in the different areas of the world needs to take into account the specificities related in particular to the shocks that affect the economies and the transmission mechanism of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">When these specificities are appropriately taken into consideration, the actions of the various monetary authorities appear overall quite homogeneous and consistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.23,0)">Appendix: Figure 1: Developments
