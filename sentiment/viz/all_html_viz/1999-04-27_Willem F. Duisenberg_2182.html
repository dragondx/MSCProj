    <span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)"> EMU: growth through stability Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Global Economy Conference organised by the Economic Strategy Institute on 27 April 1999 in Washington D.C. 1 Introduction Following almost a decade of meticulous preparation and economic convergence, 1 January 1999 saw the start of Stage Three of Economic and Monetary Union  , with the introduction of the euro and a single monetary policy for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">This area constitutes an economic region that roughly equals the United States in terms of both its economic strength and its degree of macroeconomic openness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.62,0)">The euro area has a population of 292 million, which is slightly larger than that of the United States, at 270 million, and a somewhat smaller GDP of EUR 5,800 billion compared with the EUR 7,600 billion of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">As will be clear from these figures, the euro area economy is of a formidable magnitude, and indeed is one of the largest economies in the world, with a purchasing power matched only by that of the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">It is my conviction that EMU has the potential to stimulate further the growth of the euro area economy and to increase the prosperity of its participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">At the same time, a successful EMU is also in the interest of the United States and the world economy in general, creating opportunities for trade, direct and portfolio investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Before I address the benefits of EMU and the stability-oriented policies that have to be implemented to ensure that these benefits are achieved, let me briefly mention the main institutional bodies involved in the formulation and implementation of the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.39,0)">Monetary policy is determined by the Governing Council of the European Central Bank  , which consists of the eleven governors of the national central banks   of the participating Member States and the six members of the Executive Board of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The implementation of the single monetary policy is the responsibility of the Eurosystem, which is comprised of the ECB and the eleven NCBs of the participating Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.9,0)">The Executive Board of the ECB is a separate decision-making body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Its role is to ensure that the tasks conferred upon the European System of Central Banks   are implemented, either through its own activities or through the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">2 Economic growth - the benefits of EMU I should now like to address the benefits of EMU and why I believe that the introduction of the euro and the single monetary policy can result in higher economic growth in the euro area and thereby contribute positively to the development of the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Of course, the degree to which these benefits are achieved depends not only on the monetary policy of the Eurosystem but even more so on accompanying stability-oriented fiscal policies and appropriate labour market policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">The most important contribution that the Eurosystem's monetary policy can make to maximising the benefits of EMU is to fulfil its primary objective of maintaining price stability, as laid down in the so-called Maastricht Treaty; the Treaty on European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.13,0)">As has long been argued by central bankers and is increasingly accepted by academic economists, inflation and deflation are economically and socially costly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">EMU is a tool with which to consolidate the progress made towards price stability in recent years and to firmly anchor expectations in line with price stability, thereby establishing the framework necessary to fully exploit the opportunities of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The Eurosystem enjoys full independence in determining the appropriate level of interest rates so as to satisfy its primary objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.02,0)">Moreover, the members of the Governing Council of the ECB have long terms of office and may only be dismissed on grounds of serious misconduct or inability to perform their duties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">These provisions imply that the concept of monetary stability benefits from explicit legal protection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">A further important benefit of EMU is that it has removed the risk of serious real exchange rate misalignments within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">This contributes to economic growth and helps to avoid any misallocation of resources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In fact, it enables the European Single Market to function smoothly and thereby makes it possible to reap all the rewards, to the benefit of producers and consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Furthermore, the start of Stage Three of EMU has also eliminated short-term intra-EU exchange rate volatility and exchange rate risks, and has thereby encouraged trade and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In addition, the benefits of economic integration afforded by the development of the Single Market are enhanced by the elimination of the transaction costs of exchanging different currencies, a direct result of the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">While they are difficult to measure, they effectively form an additional layer of protection for domestic producers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The single currency makes prices across the euro area directly comparable, which should increase competition and hence efficiency and economic growth in the area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">A number of further positive effects on economic growth flow from the elimination of separate currencies in the euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">One benefit is the potential for the reduction of risk premia built into real interest rates, which, in turn, will stimulate productive investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Another benefit is that by facilitating the development of deep and integrated capital markets, the single currency should further reduce long-term rates via the elimination of an illiquidity premium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In addition, a wider and deeper capital market in the euro area will improve intermediation between savers and investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">3 Ensuring the benefits: stability-oriented policies It should be emphasised, however, that the true benefits of EMU derive from the fact that it is a unique opportunity to shape a macroeconomic environment conducive to stability, growth and employment, and to foster structural change which is needed to maintain or restore medium to long-term dynamism in the European economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.92,0)">It will be clear that this is not an easy process and monetary policy alone cannot achieve this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The full benefits of the single currency will come only if there is appropriate support from other stability-oriented policies, especially fiscal and labour market policies, and if structural reforms are carried out in these areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Thus, price stability is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for grasping all the opportunities of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">In this regard, it is of the utmost importance that the governments of the EU Member States continue to implement sound and stability-oriented fiscal policies, by which I mean policies aiming at the medium-term objective of a budgetary position close to balance or in surplus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As you will know, this condition is stipulated by the Stability and Growth Pact, which ensures the lasting compliance of fiscal policies with the requirement of budgetary prudence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.67,0)">From the perspective of a central banker, a prime reason for the establishment of the Pact was that a lack of fiscal discipline would negatively affect the ability of the Eurosystem to achieve its primary objective to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In this sense, the Stability and Growth Pact is one of the most important safeguards that will ensure that price and fiscal stability remains the cornerstone of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Therefore, it should be clear that I regard it as crucial for governments to make further structural improvements to their fiscal positions, as this would allow them to regain sufficient flexibility in their budgets and, most importantly, could effectively contribute to supporting stability and growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In this regard, I should like to note that only moderate fiscal consolidation is currently envisaged for the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">A number of national stability programmes only aim to attain the necessary flexibility at a relatively late date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">It is important that we see a commitment from policy-makers either to ensuring the swift achievement of this aim or to going beyond the aims envisaged in these programmes once economic growth has picked up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Let me turn now to the contribution that stability-oriented structural reforms, particularly of euro area labour markets, can play in reducing unemployment and in supporting the stability of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The high level of European unemployment is quite rightly a source of deep concern and should be addressed at a fundamental level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Clearly, the approaches that are most likely to have a lasting effect are those that address the root causes of the problem, not just the symptoms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.21,0)">The root causes of high unemployment in the European Union are structural rigidities in the labour market as well as tax and public transfer policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This view is supported by a wide body of academic literature and was also a key finding of the OECD Jobs Study.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.68,0)">It is obvious that structural problems require structural solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.83,0)">Implementing an inflationary monetary policy would not result in lasting reductions in unemployment, but would actually serve to exacerbate the problem over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.07,0)">I recognise that structural reforms are not always easy to implement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.39,0)">The benefits are often enjoyed in the medium term, while short-term costs for some groups may mean that reforms are vigorously opposed by interest groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Although there is a common objective of reducing unemployment, there is no common programme of reforms that will work in all countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">While it is possible to learn from the experience of others, each Member State will wish to develop workable policies that reflect its own particular circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Although the path of structural reform is not always an easy one, it is the only way in which we can achieve the lasting reductions in unemployment that are so urgently needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Only structural reforms that aim to create stable labour markets in which there is flexible interaction between supply and demand will ensure that the benefits of EMU in terms of economic growth are achieved to the maximum extent possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">4 Conclusions To conclude, Economic and Monetary Union provides a great opportunity to create and maintain a large zone of price stability and economic prosperity in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">However, while price stability is a necessary condition for fully grasping the opportunities of EMU, it is not, in itself, sufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Stability-oriented polices regarding the development of national fiscal positions and the functioning of labour markets are also of crucial importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">As I have explained, the benefits of EMU will not come in a quasi-automatic way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">While monetary policy will make its contribution by following policies that maintain price stability, other economic policies must be implemented to ensure that the opportunities of the single currency are achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.14,0)">Monetary policy alone - however well designed and implemented - cannot solve Europe's economic problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Policy-makers in all areas must be determined to take proper account of the new environment of Stage Three of EMU and its consequences when forming their policies.</span>
