    <span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)"> European economic governance: early lessons from the crisis Keynote speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the Conference “The Werner Report, 50 Years on”, organised by the Luxembourg Centre for Contemporary and Digital History in cooperation with EUI Florence Virtual, 8 October 2020 Introduction In my remarks today, I will focus on three elements which I believe could outlast the EU crisis response – and could perhaps form Pierre Werner’s legacy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">A substantial crisis response at European and national level with a threefold legacy Europe’s historic response to today’s unprecedented crisis not only coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Werner Report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It also puts the report’s economic reasoning into practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In Werner’s view, monetary integration had to be accompanied by a partial Europeanisation of fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Such Europeanisation does not necessarily imply full harmonisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">As set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it means that countries coordinate and conduct their national economic and fiscal policies in a manner that contributes to maintaining the stability of the EU as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The policy responses to the pandemic respect these principles and hold important lessons for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The European-level response has been substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">The ECB has taken far-reaching exceptional monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The pandemic emergency purchase programme, targeted longer-term refinancing operations, and pandemic emergency longer-term refinancing operations have provided over €2 trillion in liquidity since March – and we also decided on changes in the collateral framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">We estimate that, by the end of 2022, all of these measures will have increased real GDP growth in the euro area by around 1.3 percentage points and inflation by around 0.8 percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Our crisis-related supervisory decisions are freeing up some €120 billion of bank capital which could be used to absorb losses or potentially finance up to €1.8 trillion of lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The European Commission and the Member States in the Council took decisive measures to support national governments, firms and workers, helping to cushion the immediate impact of the crisis  , which together amount to up to €540 billion in loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Moreover, in late July, the European Council agreed on a recovery plan to secure a more even and sustained recovery across EU economies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Although these measures have yet to be implemented, they have had a crucial impact on the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">In line with the EU’s institutional framework, national governments have done most of the initial heavy lifting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Euro area governments have so far adopted measures worth about 4.5% of GDP and loan guarantees equivalent to another 20% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Ad hoc fiscal reinsurance I see the historic nature of the EU response not in the sheer size of EU spending – which is indeed unprecedented –but rather in the organisation of governance in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">For the first time in its history, the EU is taking on common debt to help finance a recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Some might see this as establishing a precedent enabling the EU to issue debt in potential future crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But this does not mean that outside of crisis times and the 2021-27 multiannual financial framework, common debt issuance should become the norm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.45,0)">The debt issuance under the recovery fund is legally designed to be temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">While demonstrating European solidarity, it is an ad hoc fiscal reinsurance supporting national governments in their crisis response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It signals that fiscal policy remains largely national and subject to control by national parliaments, reflecting that budgetary policy is their key prerogative, in other words, their “Königsrecht”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">New space carved out for EU policies My second observation is that the crisis response has carved out potential new space for EU policies, an effect that is, of course, not unique to this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">The response to the coronavirus   crisis has underlined the importance of a common approach to common problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Take the “Next Generation EU” recovery fund which provides financing to fulfil the EU’s priorities, notably the green and digital transitions, thereby helping to avoid economic divergence and to increase resilience and potential growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The recovery fund is disbursed to national governments on condition that it is used for making commonly agreed investments and reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">This arrangement could lay the groundwork for common EU policies in areas of collective interest which are underpinned by direct EU spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Against this background, I would welcome a serious discussion about EU public goods so as to identify where the case for them is strongest and how they may be in part financed through the EU budget.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.79,0)">This is precisely what the principle of subsidiarity prescribes: policy measures should be taken at the most local levels of governance unless they can be implemented more efficiently at a more central level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Opportunity for a clearer delineation of responsibilities Such a debate – and this is my third observation – could also extend to a broader review of the allocation of competences across the different governance layers in our supranational community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Clarity on which policies should be European would help bring clarity on what should be kept national, allowing Europe and its Member States to establish a greater sense of the necessary alignment of liability and responsibility across the different layers of government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The quality of governance at the relevant responsibility level would benefit in three ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">First, a clearer delineation of responsibility could lead to better economic outcomes, as policies that have been designated as a national competence can then be better tailored to local circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Differences in economic circumstances and institutional settings, as well as national preferences, can be taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Second, national sovereignty over the design of certain policies naturally allows multiple approaches to compete with each other, potentially spurring innovation and accelerating the identification of best practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The EU offers a unique space for such policy competition, not just because of the diversity of its Member States, but also because of its common institutional framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">To be fair and to produce welfare-enhancing outcomes, competition needs to be subject to common rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Positive policy competition in national domains thus needs to rely on a rules-based framework of commonly agreed boundaries such as those provided by the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">And our framework even goes one step further: it is underpinned by supranational institutions such as the European Court of Justice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">It guarantees a level playing field for all Member States, big and small, so that the best policies can succeed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Beyond rules and institutions, another way of preventing competition from drifting into destructive rivalry is to delegate some policy areas to the EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I can think of several aspects of financial markets which would benefit from this kind of delegation, which – in the absence of a treaty change – would need to be taken by unanimous decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">In the fight against money laundering, for example, a European agency to supervise and coordinate country-level efforts would offer powerful support, thereby closing loopholes arising from differences in national regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">A proper EU capital markets union would lead to deeper and more diversified sources of financing for European businesses and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">For that to happen, financial market regulation first needs to be further harmonised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">However, applying the rules of civil law should not be mistaken for financial regulation .And the completion of the banking union, notably through the creation of a European deposit insurance scheme, would make the euro area banking system safer while promoting healthy competition among banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Third, a clearer understanding of the delineation of responsibilities between the national and EU levels would improve political accountability and legitimacy all round.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This is well reflected in two important political principles identified in the Werner report.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Werner argues that the degree of European integration should be proportionate to the objective, and that any transfer of power to the EU level should go hand-in-hand with a corresponding transfer of parliamentary responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.95,0)">So far, the political dimension of the EU’s integration has been the most neglected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">Shifting competences to the European level needs to be accompanied by further political integration and democratic accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Ensuring that everyone plays by the same rules is an important component of our European democracy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The EU is built on the principles of equal and fair participation in economic and political life, which can only be guaranteed through strict enforcement of the rule of law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Any shift in powers to the European level must not come at the expense of the representation of EU citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.07,0)">In particular, democratic participation at the national level cannot simply be replaced by indirect participation at the EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.65,0)">If public risk-sharing, for example, is to become a permanent feature, the roles of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council would have to be reviewed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.89,0)">These are constitutional issues that would – if we were to go down this road – require a rethink of the fundamental structure of the EU and would ultimately need to be reflected in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The fact that the crisis response has been designed within the EU institutional framework shows that our framework is flexible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">It leaves the EU and its Member States scope to tailor policy responses to specific situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,95.25,0)">But it also leaves a grey area of blurred responsibilities between the national and EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.8,0)">This ambiguity may undermine the EU’s full potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">A Treaty change, if there were appetite for one, would be an opportunity to incorporate in our common framework the tools used in the last crisis, such as the European Stability Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It could also confirm whether the instruments used in this crisis – such as the possibility to issue common debt in exceptional times – would be at the EU’s disposal in the event of future adverse shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Moreover, a Treaty change could allow for a review of which responsibilities are national and which are European.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">The envisaged Conference on the Future of Europe offers a chance to obtain people’s views and input on these issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">This could help structure future debates and form a good example of how to enhance democratic accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Such debates should touch on issues that are especially important to people’s lives, such as internal and external dimensions of security, a common border policy and a more responsive foreign policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Werner was aware that some Europeanisation of fiscal policy was an important element for the currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">In response to the COVID-19 crisis, such Europeanisation has reached its peak in common debt issuance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Such crisis measures are justified by the pandemic, but they should not be taken beyond crisis times without parallel deepening of the institutional functioning of democracy at the Union level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">What we can and should take beyond the crisis are our common principles that have served us well, such as a common approach to common problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">And we should use this opportunity for a clearer delineation of responsibilities and competences among the different governance layers in our supranational community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Jean Monnet famously stated “Europe will be forged in crises and will be the sum of the solutions adopted for those crises.” Let’s keep striving to ensure that the legacy of this crisis is a positive one.</span>
