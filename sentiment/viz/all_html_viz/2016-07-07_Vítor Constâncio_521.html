    <span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)"> Challenges for the European banking industry Lecture by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB,at the Conference on “European Banking Industry: what’s next?”, organised by the University of Navarra,Madrid, 7 July 2016 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, I warmly thank the organisers for inviting me again to this important event in Madrid, where I last spoke two years ago, also in the context of the Master in Banking and Financial Regulation of the University of Navarra.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The future of banking is certainly a very topical subject, particularly after the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.59,0)">The 2007-08 episode clearly demonstrated that financial crises, particularly when they involve the banking sector, can be enormously expensive both in terms of direct fiscal costs and associated costs for the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Over the period 2008-14 accumulated gross financial sector assistance by euro area governments amounted to 8% of euro area GDP, of which, so far, around 3% has been recovered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.06,0)">Moreover, the crisis induced the Great Recession and the costs of foregone output have been severe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.84,0)">At the aggregate level, the euro area output is now 20% below the level it would have achieved had the trend growth in the previous 15 years continued after 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.4,0)">Considering that the economy would grow from now on at that same trend, the accumulated loss of output until 2030, properly discounted, would represent more than three times the whole output of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.51,0)">The crisis left a permanent economic loss with broad scars in our societies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">In light of these consequences, regulators embarked on an ambitious international regulatory reform programme after the crisis, which has mostly concentrated on making the banking system safer and more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">In this respect, significant progress has been made: in the euro area, banks have materially bolstered their capital positions, with the average common equity Tier 1 ratio of significant institutions rising to 13% by end-2015 from around 9% in 2012 and 7% in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">To a large extent, challenges and transformations in the banking sector are of a global dimension, even if I will mostly illustrate it with European data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The crisis was however not the sole product of banks’ behaviour but also of the shadow banking sector that expanded rapidly in the run-up to the crisis, forming a new market-based credit system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.78,0)">There are unfortunately different concepts of shadow banking that add to confusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">One version relates to all credit intermediation done by non-banks; another, more relevant approach is not based on entities but encompasses all activities of the new market-based credit system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This comprises a vast array of financial services, in which banks are also involved, resulting from the expansion of securitisation; of securities financing transactions  , i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">securities lending and repurchase agreements  ; of collateral management and intermediation; and finally, of risk transformation via transactions using derivative swaps , from credit default swaps to interest rate or forex swaps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Several of these activities can be conducted by regulated banks or by less regulated institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.09,0)">These activities became of extreme importance for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">First, they contributed to the creation of a market-based lending system backed by secured short-term market funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This is the proper concept of shadow banking or what is also called the new market-based credit system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.68,0)">Second, these activities originated types of liquidity instruments which are forms of money not usually counted in the regular monetary aggregates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.06,0)">Several authors ,   designate this type of activity as shadow banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Those features, especially the expansion of credit assets funded with short term securities   led to a significant increase in the leverage of the entire finance activity and created chains of inside liquidity, including by means of re-use of “repo-ed” securities, phenomena which were at the centre of the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.81,0)">The markets for these non-deposit short term financial liabilities became very large and were crucial for the excessive leverage and the illusion of abundant liquidity that led to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The origins of this new credit system are related to the emergence of very sizeable cash pools looking for safer places to keep that cash in the short-term than in the form of banks’ uninsured deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Secured collateral lending and repos as well as risk transformation via swap derivatives   were developed for that purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Securities lending for shorting and generating collateralised levered transactions for asset managers were also part of the new system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.53,0)">The activities of re-hypothecation and re-use of securities in the repo market amplified the creation of chains of inside liquidity and high leverage with negative consequences when haircuts increased and the repo market turned illiquid as the crisis unfolded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The international financial regulatory reform has primarily focused on the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">It has not yet dealt with these new activities in an appropriate way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.62,0)">One could even say it has aggravated what Charles Goodhart called the “boundary problem” , referring to the gap created between the more regulated part of the system, arguably the banks, and other less regulated financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.72,0)">As he argues “If regulation is effective it will constrain the regulated from achieving their preferred, unrestricted position, often by lowering their profitability.” A crucial rationale for bank regulation relates to the fact that when they concede credit, banks create money by creating a corresponding deposit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">This activity that is at the centre or our credit-money system, involves a significant liquidity transformation as deposits are much more liquid than credits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">In a recent book, Mervyn King called this property the “alchemy of banking”  and many reforms have been proposed to overcome the fragilities created by banking as we know it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.47,0)">I will examine some of them later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">While not taking in deposits, non-bank entities forming the new financial sector should also be subject to some new regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">There is a need to address vulnerabilities created by the expansion of leveraged assets funded by short-term liabilities that play the same role as money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Meanwhile, assets of Money Market Funds and all other types of Investment Funds have increased from EUR 5.6 trillion to 11.4 trillion in 2015, moving from 17% to 40% of total bank assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.67,0)">The expanded role of capital markets and the market-based credit system with the resulting shrinkage of the banking sector are not per se negative developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Diversification and competition contribute to enhance efficiency and to lower transaction costs in the financing of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Banks too have welcomed the embryonic initiatives of the EU Commission to develop a capital markets union in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">As mentioned previously, banks also participate in the new forms of financing and the bigger ones are crucially involved in all the activities linked to capital markets, from the issuance to the distribution of securities and trading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.94,0)">On the other hand, existing Investment Funds are often part of banking groups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.48,0)">However, despite adjustments in business models, more traditional banks face accrued challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Today, I will argue that banks are under siege but a successful adaptation to the challenges they face is key to revive their prospects and their effective contribution to credit intermediation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.23,0)">After all, one cannot ignore the importance of a stable, profitable and competitive banking sector for sustainable economic growth, even if it is bound to shrink.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In this lecture, I will first dwell upon the main challenges that banking activity faces in the world at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I will then discuss some proposals that aim at a deep reform of the financial system, in view of the future role of banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.25,0)">Finally I will focus on the specific challenges confronting the euro area banking sector, from low profitability to excessive NPLs, overbanking and new regulations like TLAC and MREL.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.43,0)">Banks under siege: general challenges Beyond increased competition from non-banks, the banking sector faces competition from Financial Technology   firms with other challenges relating to the low interest rate environment as well as the regulatory measures still to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">2.1.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">FinTech threat of unbundling banks There is a lot of hype around the emergence of new specialised start-up financial firms that take advantage of digitalisation and big data techniques aimed at unbundling the activities of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is not foreseeable despite the current excitement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">This is because banks will also adopt the new technologies and will defend their franchise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Furthermore, after crossing some thresholds, the new forms of finance will eventually start to be regulated due to the same market failures and externalities   that justify regulation in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.3,0)">Having said that, payment services could indeed become a domain where banks may lose significant market share.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Other activities at stake comprise: savings and investment management over the internet, with robo-advisors that provide algorithm-based portfolio management services online at a fraction of the costs associated with traditional portfolio managers and investment advisors; crowdfunding or direct equity funding of projects by investors gathered mostly over the internet; peer-to-peer lending   whereby online services match lenders and borrowers which can be individuals or small businesses; or online money management advice aggregating all bank and savings accounts of the clients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Hundreds, if not thousands of start-ups can be found in all of these domains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.78,0)">The whole sector is nevertheless still quite small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">According to a recent study by McKinsey, USD 23 billion of venture capital and growth equity has been deployed to FinTechs in the five years to 2014, with around one-half of this total invested in 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">A significant part of this investment was concentrated in the area of payment services, where banks are facing the biggest challenge from these new competitors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It is followed by P2P lending, which is the next most developed activity, funded by hedge funds, institutional investors and sometimes even banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.11,0)">The first accidents with bad credits started to emerge recently as big data and smart algorithms can also fail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">As the sector expands, many more episodes will likely occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Furthermore, if it starts to cater for regular retail funding it will gradually become regulated as a banking activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.42,0)">Nevertheless, intensified competition from FinTech companies represents a potential threat for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.02,0)">If they do not respond effectively to this challenge, this could lead to a loss of market share and significant reduction in bank revenue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.94,0)">In five major retail banking-businesses  , according with McKinsey, 10 to 40% of revenues and between 20 and 60% of profits will be at risk by 2025, with consumer finance identified as the most vulnerable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.4,0)">In the end, new competitors will likely capture only a small portion of these businesses, with banks’ losses most likely coming from margin compression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The new technology of the distributed ledger or blockchain is of a different nature and represents an opportunity, mostly for banks that have financial capacity to invest in it, and can establish a wide network of secure, less expensive account transactions and settlements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Even that will not dispense with some central official role to ensure final settlement and validate the reputation and qualification of participant institutions in the network.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.63,0)">Private money like Bitcoin, behind the blockchain technology, cannot go far due to lack of confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Like many commercial banks, central banks are also actively studying possible developments in this area and attentive to their potential role in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.06,0)">2.2.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Uncertainty in the finalisation of the regulatory agenda On the regulatory side, many of the measures deriving from the post-crisis agenda are already in place: capital requirements were increased,  , a leverage ratio was imposed, new liquidity rules were established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">The Liquidity Coverage Ratio   which was implemented in the EU in October 2015 aims to ensure that banks have enough liquid assets to meet liquidity needs over the following 30 days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.63,0)">Moreover, the Net Stable Funding Ratio   which will enter into force at a later stage but is already complied with by most euro area banks will require banks to replace short-term with longer term funding, which is generally more costly  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The experience of the crisis has however demonstrated that some trade-off in profitability versus resilience is well justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Importantly, a few remaining initiatives on the regulatory agenda for banks and the non-bank sector still need to be finalised and implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">After the revision of capital requirements for the trading book and the final calibration of the Leverage Ratio, capital requirements will still be fine-tuned with a full revision of the Standardised Approach as well as some restrictions on the use of banks’ internal models in the Internal Ratings Based   approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision   and the Governors and Heads of Supervision   have nevertheless communicated that the overall bank capital requirements will not be significantly increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A Quantitative Impact Study   is being conducted for the banks to report the consequences of the drafted measures and a final decision will be taken in Autumn, only after these consequences are assessed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The commitment is that there will be no Basel IV and that Basel III will be concluded by year-end thus providing regulatory certainty for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.78,0)">Another ongoing discussion that has added to regulatory uncertainty concerns the treatment of sovereign exposures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This discussion is important and could indeed have a significant impact on the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Three principles form the ECB’s view on the matter: first, we agree with the rationale to change the present system, where sovereign exposures are treated as a risk-free asset; second, the revision should not create undue turbulence in markets, like the repo market or short-term money markets at large, where sovereign debt is widely used; third, the regulatory change should be at the level of the international standard, i.e., it should come out of the BCBS’ discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This latter principle is also in line with the Five Presidents' Report and the BCBS is working on the issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Also at the international level, an agreement was reached at the end of last year on the Total Loss Absorbing Capacity, or TLAC, for global systemically important banks   with a view to overcoming the “too-big–to-fail” issue and making resolution simpler and more predictable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">TLAC still needs to be implemented in Europe, where the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive   provides for a similar concept designated as Minimum Requirement of Eligible Liabilities   applicable to all banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The ongoing MREL regulatory preparations, in parallel with TLAC implementation, will be key to ensure a consistent approach towards loss absorbing capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The way MREL will be calibrated by the Single Resolution Mechanism will also have an important impact on banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.06,0)">The preliminary announcements to the industry and a possible interpretation of the Delegated Regulation recently published by the EU Commission, has led to estimates of MREL eligible liabilities by market analysts that would imply new subordinated debt issuance needs in the order of EUR 560 bn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.08,0)">Such high required levels of issuance also stem from the assumption that existing senior bank bonds that do not have a subordination clause would not be counted to fulfil MREL.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.91,0)">Such a requirement for subordination exists in the TLAC standard but the BRRD omits the issue and the EU Commission or the Single Resolution Board have not yet clarified what will be applied in the case of MREL.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.96,0)">The whole set of issues related to MREL have to be addressed with great care, as very high, new requirements of subordinated debt or capital would not easily be absorbed in present market conditions and would therefore lead to financial stability concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.12,0)">Ultimately, the level of MREL required for a bank should depend on how it is planned to be resolved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">On this matter, let me note that the BRRD sets no direct or automatic link between determining the MREL level, and the 8% bail-in rule enables the use of the resolution fund for absorbing losses or to recapitalise a bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.89,0)">They are separate requirements, which serve different purposes, and therefore also have different scopes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.26,0)">2.3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.8,0)">Low interest rate environment Beyond the structural trends and regulatory developments described earlier, the current low interest rate environment, at global level, also poses important challenges for the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.85,0)">To understand why interest rates are so low, it is useful to refer to the concept of an equilibrium   real interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The importance of this concept is that it provides a sort of anchor to a monetary economy, implying that monetary policy needs to shadow the real equilibrium rate in order to meet its price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.53,0)">When applying different model-based methods to estimate the real equilibrium rate for the euro area, it emerges that, in comparison to pre-crisis years, estimates of the equilibrium real rate have sharply declined during the crisis and have continued on a declining trend and are now in negative territory, as is the case for the U.S.  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.98,0)">If the real equilibrium rate is decreasing then failure of monetary policy to accompany the downward trend would leave the economy with too high borrowing costs with respect to the return on investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.03,0)">In turn, this would discourage investment and consumption and generate recessionary and deflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.22,0)">2.4.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,167.22,0)">Regulation of shadow banking and the boundary problem The regulatory reforms for the banking sector are contributing to a shift of activity and the emergence of new players in the non-banking space, which in turn is leading to tougher competition in areas traditionally dominated by banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">To ensure a level playing field and to contain the emergence of new risks beyond banking, we need to continue our efforts to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework for non-banks and market-based activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">In my view, while we have improved our understanding of the risks in this part of the financial system, there is still significant work ahead of us to overcome the potential weaknesses in the regulation of entities and activities in this sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Let me mention two areas where important efforts are currently underway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">First, at the global level, the Financial Stability Board   has just published its consultation paper on addressing structural vulnerabilities in the asset management sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">The paper lays out various recommendations that aim at strengthening the resilience of asset management and investment funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Second, at the EU level, the work of the European Banking Authority   on the new prudential regime for investment firms is well under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This new regime will cover a significant number of non-bank entities providing investment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">As recommended in the EBA report of December 2015, the regime is expected to have three tiers, aiming at introducing risk-sensitivity and proportionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Systemic bank-like entities are expected to be subject to the full CRR/CRD IV requirements, and less significant entities subject to less onerous and more specific requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Another important aspect in dealing with the risk stemming from shadow banking activities relates to the introduction of macroprudential margins and haircuts in SFTs, including repos, as well as in OTC Derivatives transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">These tools would reach beyond the banking system and also address the build-up of leverage and liquidity risks in parts of the financial system, where we have seen rapid growth in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Macroprudential authorities should have the power to set margins and haircuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Margins and haircuts are a determinant of the build-up of leverage via derivatives and SFTs, and are strongly interlinked with the procyclicality of that leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.56,0)">For derivatives, the initial margin determines the amount of exposure that can be created for a given amount of equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.77,0)">In turn, the size of the haircut on SFT collateral, particularly in repos, determines the amount of funding market players can obtain for a given amount of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.4,0)">In exuberant times, low volatility and risk-aversion as well as competitive pressure lead to low margins and haircuts, supporting the build-up of leverage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">When the cycle turns, higher volatility and higher risk aversion feed into higher margins and haircuts, amplifying de-leveraging pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.6,0)">As a result, a vicious cycle can emerge, where higher margins and haircuts force de-leveraging and more sales, generating a liquidity spiral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.75,0)">That is what Gary Gorton called “the run on repo” in the core of the recent financial crisis  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.85,0)">The practices of re-use and re-hypothecation of securities also deserves to be looked into and limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.31,0)">These practices amplified the expansion of inside liquidity, creating the liquidity illusion that all individual institutions were well funded which was proven not true when “the run on repo” unfolded with significantly higher haircuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Another important measure to mitigate excessive leverage in the shadow banking sector would be to introduce prudential leverage ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">To monitor and impose a limit on both simple and synthetic leverage ratios, built by the use of derivatives, would be essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Appropriately, the monitoring of the two concepts of leverage is included in the FSB proposed policy recommendations to address structural vulnerabilities from asset management activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The alchemy of banks, the financial crisis and structural reform proposals The discussion about the expansion of non-bank banking activities raises the issue whether a more fundamental reform of the monetary and financial system is necessary to reduce the probability of financial and banking crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The essential fragility of banks, and now of the market-based credit system, is the enormous maturity transformation inherent to their activity, where the commitment to honour short-term liabilities – either in the form of deposits or short-term securities – has to be ensured at all moments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.92,0)">In the past, the privilege of creating money by taking-in deposits, resulting from the extension of credit, justified the more intense regulation of banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">However, as explained earlier, other entities or activities are also now engaged in creating forms of money, increasing the maturity transformation and leverage of the system while not being regulated as banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.5,0)">Trying to contain leverage in the financial system by just putting more demands on banks will not address the system expanding outside the boundary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Proposals to address the problem have emerged since the crisis and try to put an end to “the alchemy of banking”, thus eliminating panics and runs either on deposits or on repos and similar short-term liquidity “promises”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Building on ideas dating back to the 1930s, the proposal of Narrow Banking, sustains that banks would collect deposits remunerated at very low interest and would only invest in very safe and short-term assets, such as government treasury bills.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.87,0)">Extending credit to firms would not be permitted, for not being sufficiently safe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Financing of investment would have to come from capital markets or firms’ self-financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There is a variety of versions of this proposal, the famous one being the so-called Chicago Plan, proposed in 1930 by Chicago professor, Irving Fisher and also temporarily supported by Milton Friedman, whereby a 100% liquid reserve requirement would be applied to all deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The principles of Narrow Banking were subsequently adopted by the Positive Money movement, an international social movement active in 12 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.85,0)">Besides generating a financial system that would not create enough funding for investment and growth, the approach brought to the present times has the major flaw of not addressing the “boundary problem” as it addresses only the role of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Another proposal - Limited Purpose Banking - put forward by Laurence Kotlikoff in 2010  would transform all financial institutions into entities fully funded with equity, like mutual or investment funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">Entities could extend credit but a public institution should be in charge of validating the respective ratings of those credits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.7,0)">Also in this case, the approach would lead to insufficient finance for economic development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">An interesting and challenging vision is described in the book The end of banking   written by a macroeconomist and an investment banker under a pseudonym.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.65,0)">The proposal is not only the end of banks but also the end of banking activity, defined as the “creation of money out of credit”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.27,0)">It rests on two main elements: new digital technologies and new accounting rules that would impede the “creation of money out of credit” by any type of firm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In this case, the boundary problem is explicitly recognised and addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The first element – digitalisation – will allow the unbundling of banks’ functions by different types of firms using digital techniques.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The pooling that banks do by collecting small deposits can be done over the internet; diversification of credits using hard big data to select, scoring, rating and monitoring borrowers and loans’ credit risk, are also made possible by digital algorithms; maturity transformation and supply of liquidity services can be achieved by offering market liquidity: custody accounts   would offer immediate liquidity by rapidly selling assets in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">While not being cash-deposit liquidity, the speed and optimisation software functions would get very close to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Unbundling of these functions is already taking place with FinTech and it will be completed easily, according to the authors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">However, the new FinTech institutions could still try to do banking by matching liquidity “promises” with securitised or unsecuritised credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.6,0)">The second element of the proposal impedes this by introducing a new legal and accounting concept of insolvency, that the authors call a systemic solvency rule.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.82,0)">A firm would be insolvent if its real assets would become less than its total liabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.77,0)">Financial assets would thus not be counted as real assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,118.49,0)">A different way to enunciate the rule is that a firm would be insolvent whenever its financial assets exceed its common equity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.58,0)">In this way, financial assets created by credit will have to be funded by equity and so the alchemy of creating money out of credit could not hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The proposal is not much different from Limited Purpose Banking whereby financial firms are a sort of mutual or investment fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">While financial technology would dispense with any government intervention, the proposal is not more viable than the Limited Purpose Banking, in my view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In his recent book, Mervyn King proposes another approach to the problem of creation of money or quasi-money through the granting of credit either in the form of loans or the purchase of securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In a nutshell, the proposal is as follows: all financial firms’ assets when funded by short-term liabilities would have mandatorily to be reported to the central bank and a haircut would be negotiated to be applied for the provision of central bank liquidity should a situation of liquidity stress emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">The haircuts would be negotiated well in advance of any stressful situation and the agreed liquidity provision would be extended without any other conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.55,0)">The potential huge extension of central bank liquidity with monetary policy consequences and the possibility of significant losses to the central bank in a crisis, with rapidly declining asset valuations, renders the proposal controversial and fraught with difficult practical implementation problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">It should also be stressed that the proposal, although aware of the boundary problem, does not eliminate the possibility of creation of money and quasi-money out of credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What it does is to eliminate the liquidity crises that are normally the triggers of financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">If and when inside liquidity would fail, outside   liquidity would be readily available at a price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.77,0)">A different approach to the central problem of the vulnerabilities created by the emergence of a lightly regulated sector creating short-term liabilities is suggested by Morgan Ricks in his recent book.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.74,0)">It consists of establishing the legal obligation that all forms of short-term liabilities created by financial institutions would have to be insured against a fee by an official institution, similarly to what happens to deposits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This is certainly feasible but although reassuring users of financial services, the scheme is not so encompassing as the one proposed by Mervyn King and would not avoid liquidity strains in a crisis or the creation of money out of credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.42,0)">In conclusion, this analysis shows that it is difficult, if not impossible, for our economies - so dependent on credit to invest and grow - to dispense with banking as an activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Despite being under siege with great needs of consolidation in the sector, banks are not going to disappear in the near term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">European banking sector: facts and challenges Let me turn to some of the more specific challenges that euro area banks are facing in the post-crisis environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.32,0)">First, I will focus on the low profitability environment banks operate in and then address the structural challenges related to overcapacity in some banking markets and the large stock of NPLs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Finally, I will discuss the prospects for bank consolidation and some aspects of the resolution regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">4.1.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.02,0)">Low profitability A key challenge for European banks is linked to the prolonged period of low profitability in the sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.71,0)">While bank profitability has recovered somewhat recently, it remains at very low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.75,0)">Euro area significant banks’ average Return on Equity   was 5.8% in 2015, remaining below their cost of capital  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.45,0)">In fact, the negative gap between banks’ ROE and cost of equity has persisted since the 2008 financial crisis despite some narrowing in this gap recently  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Furthermore, analysts remain unconvinced of the prospect of a significant recovery in bank profitability in the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.61,0)">This is also reflected in continued low market valuations of euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.14,0)">While market scepticism regarding banks’ earnings outlook pushed down price-to-book ratios around the globe   during the episode of heightened financial market volatility at the start of 2016, a continuing wedge between euro area and U.S. banks may partly reflect the greater challenges euro area banks are facing in restoring profitability and adjusting to a post-crisis intermediation model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.97,0)">The continued weakness in bank profitability reflects a number of factors, including both cyclical and structural challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">A key cyclical challenge is linked to the difficulties in increasing revenues in a low nominal growth and low interest rate environment and a flat yield curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.02,0)">The impact of the low interest environment on margins will vary across banks due to differences in banks’ ability to reprice deposits or in the interest rate sensitivity of their assets  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">That said, compressed margins are only one side of the coin as the positive impacts of our monetary policy accommodation helps offset the pressure on margins - through increased credit volumes, lower impairment costs, higher capital gains on securities holdings as well as through funding cost benefits from the TLTRO I  Adrian T. and H.S.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Shin  , “The
