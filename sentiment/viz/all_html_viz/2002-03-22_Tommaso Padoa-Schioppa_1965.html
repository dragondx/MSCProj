    <span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)"> Accession Countries on the Way to the Euro: A Central Banker's View, Speech by Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Conference on "Economic Policy Directions in the OECD Countries and Emerging Markets: Analysing the Experiences", Warsaw, 21 March 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">"We must build the united Europe not only in the interest of the free nations, but also in order to admit the peoples of Eastern Europe into this community if, freed from the constraints under which they live, they want to join and seek our moral support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">We owe them the example of a unified, fraternal Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Every step we take along this road will mean a new opportunity for them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">They need our help with the transformation they have to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">It is our duty to be prepared."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.62,0)">Ladies and Gentlemen, these words were not pronounced a few years ago as part of the rhetoric of so-called EU enlargement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">They were pronounced back in 1963 by Robert Schuman, when the Soviet block was still seen as a potential winner of the cold war and the reunification of Europe in a regime of democracy and economic freedom looked like a dream.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The vision of Robert Schuman should in my view still guide decision-makers in today's enlargement process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It will in any case very much inspire the reflections on the process of EU accession and euro adoption, which I would like to share with you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">European integration and EU enlargement EU enlargement rests on the proven success of European unification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">As we all know, economic and political integration has helped ensure peace and prosperity in Europe and develop stable democracies across the continent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The process has yielded achievements that are tangible for all European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">Several countries east and south of the EU are now about to join this process in order to benefit from it and contribute to it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.43,0)">The accession of up to twelve new members poses huge challenges to the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.53,0)">Due to its sheer dimensions, it will have profound implications for the institutional design of the Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Indeed, more and more European citizens, both in the EU and in the candidate countries, want to know to what kind of Union they are going to adhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">They are inquiring about the domestic and global role of the future EU, about the shape of its civic society and about its economic governance system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.98,0)">Some observers are sceptical with regard to the ability of the EU to reform itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.53,0)">Similarly, observers had been sceptical all along the creation of monetary union, and they proved to be wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">I am confident that today's scepticism will also prove to be unfounded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Some months ago, the last remaining challenge in the setting up of monetary union has been overcome, when citizens throughout Europe have welcomed the euro banknotes and coins with enthusiasm.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">This enthusiasm is a clear indication that, when Europe undertakes a serious and ambitious project, people understand and support it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">However, the successful introduction of the euro should not distract us from the need for further reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.29,0)">Indeed, many aspects of the EU process are not yet fully developed, and the European house is unfinished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Not only geographically, but also politically, we have not achieved the "united Europe" Robert Schuman was advocating in 1963.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Four key issues from an ECB perspective From an ECB perspective, four issues in the enlargement process deserve special attention: first, real and nominal convergence; second, monetary policies and exchange rate strategies on the road towards the euro; third, the functioning and stability of the financial sector; and, last but not least, central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let me offer a brief comment on each of them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Real and nominal convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.53,0)">Several observers argue that real and nominal convergence are conflicting objectives and therefore cannot be pursued together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Some argue that real convergence – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">structural adjustment and real income catching up – should come first, as it is directly linked to welfare and living standards, and that nominal convergence – i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">meeting the nominal Maastricht criteria – should come later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Other observers argue that it is crucial to focus first on nominal convergence in order to adopt the euro as quickly as possible and to be concerned with real convergence only at a later stage, when being already part of monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.44,0)">I would like to take issue with both these views and stress that real and nominal convergence should be pursued in parallel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.2,0)">Let me explain what I mean.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Real convergence is more than the catching up in income levels; it is the adjustment of the real economies towards structures that allow the countries to participate in a monetary union without contributing to, or suffering from, significant asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The level of per capita income is a useful, but by no means always close, approximation of the relevant concept of real convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.07,0)">As you know, income levels in accession countries are still far below those of the EU, to an extent never observed in previous EU enlargements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">However, for countries that are highly integrated with the EU and advanced in the process of transition, privatisation and structural adjustment, the convergence indicators based purely on income levels may understate the true degree of real convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.19,0)">How does nominal convergence relate to real convergence?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Nominal convergence is the gradual fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Saying that nominal convergence should be pursued already at this stage means that, although the Maastricht criteria themselves will only be relevant at the moment of joining the euro, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">in some years from now, countries should already at present strive to achieve as much price stability as possible, hence work towards lowering inflation rates continuously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">If the time horizon for full compliance with the Maastricht criteria is chosen in line with the starting conditions and the economic environment, nominal convergence will not be disruptive to real convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">On the contrary, by anchoring inflation expectations both in accession countries and in international financial markets, it will facilitate the achievement of sustainable non-inflationary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.05,0)">Undoubtedly, nominal convergence remains a difficult task in accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.99,0)">Despite the progress made in recent years, several factors, including transition-related factors and productivity developments, continue to influence price developments in many countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The pace of disinflation needs to take these factors into account, and the appropriate measure of price stability   may not coincide, for some time, with the one applied in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Monetary policy and exchange rate strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">On the road towards the euro the difficult task of monetary policy and exchange rate strategies is to support the parallel pursuit of real and nominal convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">As you know, the ECB is not recommending a particular monetary policy strategy, which should uniformly apply to all accession countries, but only recommends that the aim to maintain price stability be the ultimate compass of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The monetary strategies of accession countries are generally in line with this principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">In particular, strategies of direct inflation targeting recently implemented in some countries have helped the central banks to build up credibility and further advance disinflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">In the case of Hungary inflation targeting has also been combined with a relatively flexible peg to the euro that has provided an effective external anchor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.89,0)">In all cases, however, accession countries cannot disregard exchange rate developments, given that they are small open economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Exchange rate developments are indeed crucial to the pass-through of external shocks into domestic inflation and often constitute a more powerful transmission channel of monetary policy than domestic interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">For this reason, a number of accession countries have pursued hard peg regimes or even currency board arrangements, which have served them well in their pursuit of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In practice, a growing number of accession countries already follow exchange rate strategies that are in line with the ERM II requirements and only a few will have to modify their policies to make them compatible with ERM II membership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Overall, we believe that accession countries have made good choices with regard to their monetary and exchange rate strategies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The functioning and stability of the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">A sound and well-functioning financial market is key for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">First, it is crucial for nominal convergence because it fortifies an interest-rate based monetary policy transmission and helps providing a stable macroeconomic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Second, it promotes real convergence by fostering investment and saving possibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Partly for historical reasons, in accession countries banks dominate the financial sectors even to a greater extent than in the current EU countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Over the past few years, progress in restructuring and consolidating the banking industry in accession countries has contributed to greater stability, efficiency and also integration with the EU's financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Large-scale privatisations of state-owned banks and the extensive opening-up of the banking sector to foreign ownership have, undoubtedly, supported the strengthening of the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">This is one of the reasons why accession countries have weathered the global emerging market crisis of the past few years so well and suffered from little contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.67,0)">However, the reform agenda is not yet complete, as in some countries the financial sector still suffers from inadequate size and instruments, is burdened by a high share of non-performing loans and suffers from inefficiencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Central bank independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Central bank independence was almost unthinkable twenty years ago in many European countries, at a time when monetary policy was still seen as an indispensable tool of government policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Experience and economic thinking have gradually given rise to the conviction that monetary policy is best left to an independent but accountable institution whose mandate is clearly specified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Central bank independence is now accepted as a practically universal consensus throughout the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">It has been implemented everywhere in the EU as a fundamental aspect of the monetary unification process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It is therefore only natural that it is also a fundamental element in the accession process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As you know, central bank independence is indeed an absolute requirement for entry into the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It is not only a formal requirement, it is also a substantial requirement and an essential component of a sound economic policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.63,0)">Unfortunately, accession countries provide us with mixed signals in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">On the one hand, most of them have amended their legislation broadly in line with the Treaty, and where gaps remain, they are mostly small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.92,0)">On the other hand, there are some countries where attempts are made – either de jure or de facto – to step back on progress already achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.66,0)">These cases are for us a reason for serious concern, as they imply that in the countries concerned the institutional framework to join the EU is undermined rather than respected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.29,0)">Let me repeat: we, at the ECB, are seriously concerned that political pressure may put central bank independence at risk in some accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.8,0)">This has once been the case with the Czech National Bank, although pressures were finally blocked by the Constitutional Court.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.8,0)">And it is now the case in Poland, where again severe political pressure is put on the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.76,0)">Last year, it was threatened to amend the central bank statute and change the size and composition of the Monetary Policy Council in a way that would make it more exposed to political influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Some days ago, the Parliament passed a resolution that makes the central bank responsible for unemployment and low growth, and aims at refocusing monetary policy towards growth and employment creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.81,0)">In all EU countries, a parliamentary resolution refocusing the objective of the central bank would be unthinkable today, since price stability is generally accepted as the key mission for the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The present statute of the Polish central bank, which foresees price stability as the objective for monetary policy, is in line with this notion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.91,0)">Changing the statute away from this objective would deviate from the generally accepted consensus and may also make Poland's path towards the EU and the euro more difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Our concerns with the situation in Poland do not stem from any lack of sensitivity to the importance of economic growth, but from the well-established experience that monetary policy can contribute to sustainable growth by focusing on price stability, rather than by artificially inflating the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">What path towards the euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me now turn to the path ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The euro is a public good that will bring many benefits to accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">It will eliminate exchange rate risk, lead to lower interest rates and contribute to low inflation and monetary stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">From this perspective, it is understandable that the accession countries are keen to adopt the euro as soon as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I can only share this aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Of course, to participate in monetary union and to fully exploit the beneficial effects, a country must be ready for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">And readiness is to be assessed on the basis of the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">As you know, the convergence criteria set by the Treaty have been the centre of much academic discussion, both when they were adopted and when they were first applied in 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.5,0)">In the context of enlargement, criticism has centred on the question whether a catching-up component should be included in the measurement of inflation or whether the criteria should be applied in the same way as they have been applied in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Without going into the details of this issue, I would like to stress the principle here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The principle is that no extra criteria whatsoever are required from accession countries different from, or additional to, those that were applied to all countries that have adopted the euro so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Of course, like for any other country, an assessment will be made about sustainable convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The Maastricht criteria are there also to contribute to making this assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.59,0)">They need to be, and will be, applied in a rigorous way, but they cannot, and will not, be applied in a simplistic or mechanistic fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">They are guideposts to help assess sustainable convergence and ultimately a judgement will have to be passed as to whether a given applicant country is ready to adopt the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Many policy-makers in accession countries are already now advocating for joining the euro sooner rather than later and this is indeed a desirable perspective in principle, as it helps to keep the reform prospect focused.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Some have expressed their wish to adopt the euro immediately after the two-year participation in ERM II; others advocate for setting even before EU accession a pre-determined timeframe to join the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Setting such a timeframe is said to anchor policies towards the fulfilment of the Maastricht criteria, thus providing the necessary incentive for virtuous economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">It is also seen as an anchor in a potential turbulent phase in financial markets, avoiding adverse shocks and shifts in market sentiment in an environment of free capital movement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.75,0)">In accession countries, however, there are also policy makers that are arguing in the opposite direction, for a possibly longer stay in the EU before the adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Their arguments are based on the fact that, as new EU members, countries will become exposed to the full competition of the single market and to the global capital market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Therefore, it remains to be seen in their view at what point in time the economies can forego the exchange rate as an adjustment tool in this new and highly competitive environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.65,0)">I believe that it is wrong to take sides in this debate in a generalised way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.35,0)">I also believe that it is too early to give an answer to this question on a case-by-case basis at the current juncture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The ECB will have to take a view in due time, conducting its assessment by looking at all the relevant factors, country by country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">It is, however, first and foremost for the individual countries concerned to review this question and prepare in the best possible way their economies for the challenges ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In closing my remarks, I would like to stress my conviction that both the EU and the accession countries will live up to their challenges and both fulfil their duty "to be prepared".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Moreover, I believe that this will turn the upcoming enlargement of the European Union into a success for the direct benefit of all citizens concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">About forty years later, we will then have the chance to turn Robert Schuman's vision into reality and build a union that will mean a new opportunity for all of us.</span>
