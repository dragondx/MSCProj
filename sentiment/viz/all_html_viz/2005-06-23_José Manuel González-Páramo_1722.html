    <span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)"> The European Central Bank’s monetary policy in an international context: principles and challenges Speech by José Manuel González-Páramo, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBUniversity of La Laguna, Tenerife, 23 June 2005 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, Let me first of all thank the Organising Committee for inviting me to the IX Conference on International Economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This event has already become an important tradition and gained a considerable reputation, as shown by the quality of the contributors to this year’s programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">It is therefore a great pleasure to have the privilege of presenting a keynote speech here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is common knowledge that the European Central Bank   began to conduct monetary policy in 1999 with the inception of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">At that time, Europe was facing a major institutional change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.21,0)">Eleven national economies, retaining their sovereignty as regards fiscal policy and structural policies, merged their monetary policy and currencies, representing a major challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.38,0)">From the perspective of conducting monetary policy alone, the enormity of this challenge becomes clear if account is taken, for example, in the context of the new Monetary Union, of the fact that economic relationships that had been valid in the past risked becoming of limited value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.5,0)">This generated uncertainty over aspects as central as the functioning of the transmission mechanism of monetary policy or the properties of statistical indicators, which were harmonised across euro area countries prior to the start of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">It was against this background of uncertainty and based on the institutional framework of the Treaty on European Union that the ECB’s monetary policy strategy was devised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I would like to describe and explain the reasons for this strategy in the first part of my talk today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">I will then provide some thoughts on comparing certain elements of this strategy with other international approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Last, I will comment on the most important challenges facing our monetary policy today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy strategy The independence of the ECB The main feature of our monetary policy strategy is that the European Central Bank and the national central banks   of the Eurosystem are fully independent, as provided for in Article 108 of the Treaty on European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.05,0)">Why is it essential for a central bank to be independent to conduct monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The answer is that independence acts as a safeguard against any inflationary bias.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Indeed, both theoretical analyses and empirical studies show that the credibility and success of monetary policy improve when related decisions remain outside the sphere of political influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Independence enhances the credibility of the central bank as regards its capacity to keep inflation in check and to anchor market expectations in line with price stability, thereby contributing to the achievement of other economic policy goals, such as sustainable growth and a high level of employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It was therefore only logical to have the principle of independence enshrined in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Of course, since independence is a core element of democratic legitimacy, it must be accompanied by the strict application of controls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.86,0)">The independent central bank is accountable for its decisions to citizens and their representatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.79,0)">Thus, this obligation, which is the flip-side of its independent status, effectively imposes discipline on the central bank to perform its tasks in line with its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The objective of price stability and its definition A second key aspect of our strategy relates to the objective of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Article 105  of the Treaty on European Union stipulates that the primary objective of the European Bank is to maintain price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The setting of this objective is recognition of the theoretical and empirical evidence accumulated over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">This evidence suggests that high rates of inflation are detrimental to growth and employment in the longer run , while an environment of stable prices supports the functioning of the markets and contributes to sustainable economic growth and greater prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The Treaty, however, left open the question of what is meant by “price stability” in operational terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">In October 1998 the European Central Bank therefore published a quantitative definition of price stability as “a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Subsequently, the Governing Council of the ECB further clarified this objective, explaining that it intended to keep inflation “below, but close to, 2% over the medium term”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is worth going into more detail about various aspects of this definition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">First, with regard to the reach of the definition, price stability is assessed on the basis of price developments in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">With a single monetary policy, decisions must be taken so that they reflect the conditions prevailing in the euro area as a whole, rather than those prevailing in specific regional or national contexts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Second, the European Central Bank decided to choose a particular general price index, the HICP, as an instrument for measuring price stability from among other options such as underlying inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This choice was made mainly for reasons of transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The HICP is the only “high quality” price index in the euro area that is sufficiently harmonised across countries and published on a monthly basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.54,0)">Moreover, this index is the closest approximation of the variations which are produced in the price of a representative basket of goods and services purchased by households in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Therefore, the use of this index clearly shows the Eurosystem’s commitment to full and effective protection against loss of purchasing power of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Third, the setting of the quantitative definition of price stability at a positive but low rate of inflation is justified by a number of considerations: On the one hand, this definition provides an adequate margin to avoid the risks of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,83.21,0)">In this regard, it should be emphasised that many of the costs associated with inflation, such as relative price distortion, also apply in situations of a sustained decline in price levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.67,0)">Also, prolonged deflation could involve risks for the stability of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.52,0)">In particular, a prolonged period of deflation coupled with weak growth could hamper the central bank in conducting monetary policy because nominal interest rates cannot fall below zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.93,0)">Any attempt to fix nominal interest rates below zero would doubtless be unsuccessful because the public would rather keep their money in cash than set up or hold savings at negative interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.2,0)">In a deflationary environment, the existence of a zero lower bound for nominal interest rates restricts the central bank’s margin for reducing real interest rates in order to stimulate demand and counteract deflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Various studies have tried to assess the probability of nominal interest rates being situated around the zero lower bound if the central bank were to set its definition of price stability at different levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The majority of these studies show that this is much less likely if the objective of the central bank is to maintain the rate of inflation at above 1% in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.05,0)">On the other hand, setting the definition of price stability above zero also takes into account the fact that any consumer price index may be subject to measurement bias, and therefore that HICP inflation may slightly overstate true inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.4,0)">Such bias can be attributed to the difficulties that statistical authorities have in adjusting the index in a timely manner to take account of ongoing improvements in the quality of goods and the changing patterns of consumer preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The precise magnitude of this bias for the euro area is difficult to estimate and probably rather small, given the continuous improvements made to the index by Eurostat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.32,0)">Finally, aiming at an inflation rate that is below, but close to, 2% avoids that individual countries operating in the euro area have to structurally live with negative or too low inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The medium-term orientation The European Central Bank’s definition of price stability refers to a medium-term horizon, in recognition of the fact that monetary policy can only control price developments in the longer term and never in the short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.02,0)">By contrast with the practice typically observed in inflation-targeting regimes, the ECB has not specified a fixed policy horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">There are many reasons for this decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.65,0)">The lags with which monetary policy affects price developments vary and are unpredictable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.75,0)">Moreover, the optimum monetary policy response always depends on the specific type and magnitude of the shocks affecting the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">A medium-term horizon allows central bankers the necessary flexibility to respond appropriately to economic shocks of a specific type.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">A medium-term orientation helps to avoid introducing unnecessary volatility into the economy and to stabilise output and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The two pillars In order to best serve its primary objective of medium-term price stability, the ECB has chosen a full-information approach which rests on two pillars: an economic analysis and a monetary analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Its aim is to ensure that all the information is taken into account and due attention is paid to different analytical perspectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The metaphor of the two pillars highlights their complementary, but distinct, perspectives in the assessment of the risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The economic analysis focuses on short to medium-term risks to price stability and is mainly based on the assessment of economic and financial developments from the perspective of the interplay of supply and demand in the goods, services and factor markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Macroeconomic projections by Eurosystem staff are regularly published for reasons of transparency and play an important role in the economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Its main purpose is to condense the information provided by economic indicators in a coherent and structured manner that is meaningful for the policy-maker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Monetary analysis provides indications of future price trends from a medium to longer-term perspective, exploiting the long-term link between money and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In this context, the analysis of money and credit developments plays an important role in determining projected medium and long-term price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">These two perspectives on the functioning of the economy therefore provide complementary information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Both analyses have their comparative advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Economic analysis is well suited to the analysis of price developments at shorter horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.58,0)">Monetary analysis acts as an early warning system for upcoming inflationary or deflationary pressures at somewhat longer horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In the absence of a satisfactory macroeconomic model that fully integrates the information from both sets of indicators, the European Central Bank has chosen to regularly cross-check the information from both pillars in order to come to an overall judgement on the risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The ECB’s accountability, transparency and communication I would like to turn now to the final key aspect of our monetary policy, namely the accountability, transparency and the communication of the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">The fast and worldwide spreading of information by modern communication technologies has enhanced the role of the mass media in our daily lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.4,0)">Wire services often publish the explanations of monetary policy-makers immediately after they have been presented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The information is analysed by financial analysts all over the world, and financial markets may react quickly to any news concerning the economy and the implied future monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">In this regard, these days central banks around the world attach a great deal of importance to achieving an optimal degree of transparency, which increases the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">An appropriate and transparent strategy complemented by explanations of day-to-day monetary policy decisions provides guidance to the markets, notably concerning inflation expectations and the future monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The issue of credibility is another important aspect of this debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In the words of Alan Blinder  , “A central bank is credible when people believe it will do what it says”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">I share his view that credibility will be enhanced if there is a close correspondence between words and deeds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.11,0)">This means, of course, that central banks must choose their words very carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">At the same time, a central bank should do all it can to ensure that both the conditional nature of forecasts and statements on the future monetary policy stance are properly understood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.9,0)">Otherwise, if, for example, the “true world” outcome differs from what was suggested, the central bank could see its credibility jeopardised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.63,0)">The inherent uncertainty necessarily faced by the central bank therefore has to be addressed in its communications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">To this end, the European Central Bank has adopted a number of important communication tools, which, together, have proven satisfactory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">After the first Governing Council meeting of the month, a press conference is held in which the main economic arguments underlying the decisions and the thrust of the discussion are conveyed to journalists almost in real time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">We regard the President’s Introductory Statement as coming close to summary minutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It contains all the relevant information for the public and is published on the European Central Bank’s website.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">There is also the possibility for journalists to address questions directly to the President and the Vice-President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">This feature makes the European Central Bank’s approach to communication extremely timely and transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Further channels for communicating the European Central Bank’s monetary policy assessment in more detail are its Monthly Bulletin and interviews and speeches given by the members of the Governing Council to many different audiences, including the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">A comparison of the ECB’s approach with other monetary policy concepts Having briefly described our monetary policy approach, let me now say a little about our institutional framework by comparison with that of other central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In such a comparison, one of the first aspects to be singled out is generally the different objectives of the ECB and the US Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The ECB’s primary objective, as I have mentioned, is price stability, while the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate that obliges it to give equal weight to the objectives “price stability” and “sustainable economic growth”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">However, in my opinion the implications of this difference have no great significance for the conduct of monetary policy, as shown by the fact that both central banks stress that price stability is the best contribution to sustainable economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In the words of Alan Greenspan   “In a democratic society such as ours, the central bank is entrusted by the Congress, and ultimately by the citizenry, with the tremendous responsibility of guarding the purchasing power of money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">It is now generally recognized that price stability is a prerequisite for the efficient allocation of resources in our economy and, indeed, for fulfilling our ultimate mandate to promote maximum sustainable employment over time”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.3,0)">As for the question of how this mandate should be implemented, an international comparison of central banks suggests that there is no unique solution, rather actual practices and operational concepts vary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Looking again at the comparison of the ECB and the Federal Reserve, while the former has published a precise quantitative definition of its primary objective – price stability – the Federal Reserve provides only a qualitative definition stated by its Chairman, Alan Greenspan  , which makes clear a commitment to low inflation   and which is supported in the FOMC.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I am sure the Federal Reserve has good reasons for its approach and it is not my role to assess these reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In our case, the uncertainties associated with the regime shift implied by the introduction of the euro made it particularly important for the ECB to be precise about the quantitative definition of its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">In my view, the ECB’s approach has three main benefits: it is good for transparency since it enables everybody to know precisely what we are aiming at; it is good for accountability as the public can judge how and to what extent we meet our aims; and, lastly, it is good for medium and long-term credibility since inflationary expectations can be anchored more easily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There is a further important difference between our monetary policy concept and that of the Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">We find it very useful to incorporate an important role for monetary analysis in our strategy in order to permit the cross-checking of our economic analysis from a medium to long-term perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">This feature of our approach contributes to the anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, which is particularly important for the ECB, as it does not have a track record as long as the Federal Reserve’s as regards the guiding of expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Inevitably, there are also many similarities between the approaches of the ECB and the Federal Reserve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Both institutions have been afforded a high degree of formal independence which, as already mentioned, is an essential component in the credibility of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">Moreover, both place significant emphasis on achieving an optimal degree of transparency and we both appear frequently before the legislature to explain our monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Another important similarity between the ECB and the Federal Reserve is our reliance on a strategy that is based on a very comprehensive analysis of indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.49,0)">Likewise, both central banks have to date been sceptical of the benefits of adopting an inflation-targeting approach similar to other central banks, such as the Bank of England or the Sveriges Riksbank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.21,0)">Why is that?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">While there are many similarities between the inflation-targeting approach and the ECB’s concept, there are some significant differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.91,0)">First of all, we consider that inflation forecasts have important limitations that may matter for the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Consequently, we did not assign an all-encompassing and overriding role to such forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.45,0)">The projections published by the ECB every quarter are staff forecasts, which play an important role as input for monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.84,0)">They are, however, not endorsed by the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.69,0)">Inflation forecasts are useful summary indicators of a wide range of variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.43,0)">They are not, however, a sufficient statistic for monetary policy in the sense that monetary policy decisions could be mechanically linked to this indicator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.53,0)">The same inflation forecast figure can be associated with quite different circumstances and may therefore imply quite different reactions on the part of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.91,0)">Moreover, inflation forecasts are typically informed by an econometric model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.81,0)">There is, regrettably, no single model that can adequately explain developments in output and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.18,0)">There is also the possibility of model misspecification.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Consequently, in order to obtain robust results, we need to employ expert judgement and to consult a variety of econometric tools and models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">There is no alternative to this, although we are continuously seeking to enhance our analytical tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.1,0)">Second, as I have said, I regard the use of a fixed forecast and policy horizon as somewhat arbitrary in the presence of large macroeconomic shocks of different kinds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Policy-makers should assess the state of the economy beyond the typical fixed forecast horizon of two or three years ahead, given that the transmission process evolves over time with variable and uncertain lags.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.58,0)">By contrast, limiting attention to a specific projection horizon may lead to policy errors, the effects of which can be undone only later at the cost of increased output volatility or lower growth rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.36,0)">In addition, appropriate monetary policy responses always depend on the nature of shocks hitting the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">An essential element of monetary policy decision-making is to evaluate and compare the robustness of the information stemming from various sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.08,0)">A strong focus on a fixed horizon would not do justice to the complexity of the transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.49,0)">This is particularly the case when large shocks or special circumstances arise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">With its medium-term orientation, the ECB avoids any problems associated with a fixed horizon, but pays due attention to the entire horizon over which monetary policy impacts on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, I do not think that the differences between our strategy and inflation targeting should be exaggerated when it comes to the actual conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Neither am I advocating one single way of ensuring its success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The different approaches that exist reflect the need to adapt to different institutional and economic environments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">In this context, it is striking that practices among successful central banks have increasingly converged over recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.51,0)">For example, nearly all today recognise that no single or “true” model for assessing the economy exists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">They emphasise the need to adopt a robust approach to policy-making which takes into account uncertainty regarding the interpretation of information and they acknowledge that the reaction to inflation forecasts cannot be mechanistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Moreover, in recent years a number of inflation-targeting central banks have also acknowledged the need to look at the medium term instead of a fixed horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.49,0)">Challenges to monetary policy in the euro area Monetary policy is conducted in a constantly changing environment which poses ever more challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Let me close by focussing on a description of some of the most important challenges that we now face.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First, the question of heterogeneity in a monetary union and how to deal with it had attracted the attention of academics long before the single currency was introduced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.85,0)">In this context, it should be said, however, that inflation dispersion across the countries of the euro area has stabilised at low levels since the inception of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.51,0)">Taking a longer perspective, the degree of inflation dispersion, measured as the   standard deviation among the 12 euro area countries, was characterised in the 90s by a strong downward trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.85,0)">Moreover, by way of comparison, since 1999 inflation dispersion across the euro area has been fluctuating close to the level observed across the 14 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.42,0)">Inflation differentials, which should be viewed as a normal phenomenon in any monetary union and an integral part of the adjustment mechanism of relative prices, have, however, been very persistent in the euro area which, to some extent, is due to misaligned national fiscal policies, improper wage developments, deep-seated structural inefficiencies such as nominal and real rigidities in product and factor markets, and insufficient structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Addressing the challenge posed by heterogeneity therefore implies an important role for structural policies to encourage greater mobility of production factors and flexibility in terms of real wages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.42,0)">It is generally agreed that assigning monetary policy the further role of directly tackling the issue of relative balance between the sectors or regions of a currency area in the process of adjusting to shocks would overextend it to the detriment of its primary objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">A monetary policy that focuses on price stability can, however, foster the correct adjustment of relative prices and the efficient allocation of resources across the sectors and countries of the euro area when asymmetric shocks occur.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Moreover, the ECB’s aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% can accommodate small regional inflation differentials, while providing an adequate safety margin to avoid some regions having to structurally operate at negative inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Moreover, we closely monitor sectoral and national developments on a regular basis in order to better formulate our assessment of the economic situation and its possible evolution for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In this respect, the analysis of disaggregated information is crucial in order to understand the nature of shocks, as many shocks of area-wide relevance originate in specific countries or sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.56,0)">Central banks face a second challenge that stems from asset price bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Historical episodes have shown that they can evolve quickly and that the costs of their bursting can be very high for the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.67,0)">Moreover, they are difficult to identify in real time and are thus often only recognised ex post.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">The academic debate suggests that several approaches are conceivable when it comes to asset price bubbles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.04,0)">Even in the rare cases in which the central bank can confidently claim to be facing an unusual and possibly destabilising asset price movement, its reaction cannot be automatic but requires careful thought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.72,0)">In this context, the ECB does not target asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">However, it pays close attention to asset price movements with a view to preserving the stability of consumer prices over longer horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">In this respect, the prominent role of money and credit in the ECB’s approach may help it to assess asset price developments and the degree to which they pose a risk to price stability in the more distant future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.56,0)">A further challenge that the ECB has faced in recent years arises from a number of shocks that have influenced both monetary and price developments, thereby complicating the extraction of medium to long-term signals as regards risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">For example, the exceptional economic, financial and geopolitical uncertainties between 2001 and 2003 contributed to a strong preference for liquid assets among agents, leading to sizeable portfolio shifts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In this environment, the ECB’s monetary analysis has made use of a variety of analytical tools and conceptual frameworks to extract from monetary developments the information relevant for monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A combination of institutional and model-based analyses has enabled the ECB to derive a modal scenario on the basis of an M3 series corrected for the estimated impact of the aforementioned portfolio shifts, which series was then used as input for simple monetary models that forecast inflation, for example leading indicator models based on monetary growth or P-star models based on measures of the money gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">A second scenario, reflecting possible upward risks to price stability as compared with the modal view, was subsequently derived using the official M3 series.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Used together, they provide a better assessment of the uncertainties related to monetary developments to be made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.93,0)">In this context, it should be borne in mind that similar money growth figures can have quite different implications for the risks to future price stability, depending on prevailing macroeconomic conditions and, in particular, on the underlying factors driving monetary growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.98,0)">Finally, let me mention a further challenge that we currently face, which is the budgetary position in a number of European countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Public finances can have a profound influence on the environment in which monetary policy operates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Along with a monetary policy geared towards maintaining price stability, sound fiscal policies are essential for stability and growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">This is why, prior to the introduction of the euro, it was decided to put in place a rule-based framework for Member States’ fiscal policies in the form of the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Some countries have managed to meet the Pact’s objectives and maintain sound budgetary positions over recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.86,0)">However, in others public finance positions have deteriorated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.99,0)">Excessive deficits have emerged, and the procedures of the Stability and Growth Pact aimed at preventing and correcting these have not always been properly complied with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">In the light of these difficulties, a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact has recently been agreed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The stated aim of this reform is to strengthen the Pact’s implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">It is now essential to ensure the rigorous and consistent implementation of the new rules in order to achieve budgetary discipline and restore the credibility of European fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Restoring sound public finances is becoming more urgent as ageing-related government spending is projected to increase substantially in the decades to come as a result of demographic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">In many countries, maintaining sustainable public finances in this context requires not only urgent action to reduce high debt ratios but also reforms of pension and healthcare systems to keep ageing-related expenditure at affordable levels in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Concluding remarks In conclusion, there is no doubt in my mind that a monetary policy strategy based on a quantitative definition of price stability and an economic and monetary analysis is the right framework for monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">In my view, this approach has been essential to ensuring the high level of credibility of the ECB and its monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This monetary policy has enabled inflation to be stabilised in the euro area and inflation expectations to be firmly anchored in line with price stability, even in the face of a number of challenging situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.84,0)">This is no mean achievement, given that the ECB had no track record for credibility to rely on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">I can assure you that the ECB will continue to focus on its primary objective of maintaining price stability in an uncertain and changing environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This is doubtless the best contribution we can make to economic prosperity and job creation in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Literature Alesina, A. and L.
