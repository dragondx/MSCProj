    <h2> Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB delivered at joint European Central Bank, Banque de France and The Conference Board Conference on “The Creation of Economic and Corporate Wealth in a Dynamic Economy” Frankfurt am Main, 16 January 2008 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Jürgen Stark </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)"> Knowns and unknowns about the creation of economic wealth in the euro area Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBdelivered at joint European Central Bank, Banque de France and The Conference Board Conference on“The Creation of Economic and Corporate Wealth in a Dynamic Economy”Frankfurt am Main, 16 January 2008 It is a pleasure for me to welcome you today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">I would like to start by thanking you all for coming to Frankfurt to participate in this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">We are happy to have a good mix of people from academia, industry and European policy institutions in this room.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">I am sure that sharing your experiences and insights with each other will prove fruitful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.95,0)">Understanding the sources of economic and corporate wealth in the euro area is challenging, and in my view there remain many unanswered questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">I am hopeful that you will shed some light on them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Allow me to start by reviewing labour productivity developments in the euro area, and in doing so highlighting the knowns and the unknowns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.11,0)">In the sixteenth century the French mathematician Viète, building on the arithmetical work done by others before, proposed the use of literal notation for knowns and unknowns, and subsequently introduced the language of formulas into mathematics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.49,0)">His initial proposal of using consonants for knowns and vowels for unknowns was subsequently modified by Descartes to what is now common practice, namely the use of the final letters of the alphabet for unknowns   and the first letters for knowns  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Viète’s seminal, work on symbolic algebra contributed to improving the productivity of mathematicians by allowing them to write a mathematical statement in just a few lines rather than in several pages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In the same spirit, I will try to keep my introductory remarks short and thus contribute to the productivity of our meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.64,0)">But, rest assured, I will not go as far as to reduce my speech to a few lines of symbols.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Demographic developments and growth As the title of this conference indicates, the euro area finds itself in a very dynamic economic environment characterised by rapid technological developments and the progressive integration of regional economies, not simply through trade but also in increasingly modularised supply chains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.43,0)">In addition to these dynamic forces, and in contrast to other regional economies, the euro area is facing now, and even more so in the future, the prospect of an ageing population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.92,0)">In the euro area, a broad decreasing trend in the contribution to growth from demographic factors has been observed since 1990.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.84,0)">This reflects of both a decline in population growth and the ageing of the population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.51,0)">Over this same period, the contribution from labour productivity growth has also decreased gradually.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.09,0)">As a result, real GDP growth has fallen from 3.6% to 2.0%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.26,0)">Demographic factors contributed 0.3 percentage point to this decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Future demographic trends in the euro area are likely to be driven by lower fertility rates and rising life expectancy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.67,0)">Available projections suggest that the population of the euro area will start to shrink in absolute terms after 2020, and that one out of three will be older than 65.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.42,0)">Simulations of the impact of demographic projections on real GDP and real GDP per capita growth do not offer a reassuring picture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.31,0)">Under the assumption of a) unchanged labour productivity growth rates, of b) an unchanged percentage of people of working age in employment, and of c) an unchanged number of average weekly hours worked, the projected demographic trends imply a decline in average real GDP growth between 2020 and 2050 to 1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.6,0)">Importantly, the deterioration in GDP growth per capita would also be noticeable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.83,0)">One could argue that demographic projections are highly unreliable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">One could also argue that the adverse demographic developments on growth could be offset by increasing the average number of hours worked and the percentage of people of working age in employment, and also by raising the retirement age.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, individual measures for raising labour utilisation face natural limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Therefore, the inevitable implication of such demographic developments is that the key to a prosperous future lies in raising labour productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.72,0)">Indeed, without higher productivity growth, the euro area is destined to see its growth potential remaining low or declining significantly over the next few decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.53,0)">Allow me next to briefly review a few known facts about labour productivity developments in the euro area in recent decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.91,0)">Labour productivity developments in the euro area Labour productivity growth in the euro area has been declining since the early 1960s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.4,0)">This slowdown in labour productivity mainly reflects less innovation and other efficiency gains  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.08,0)">Over more recent decades, lower growth in capital used per unit of labour has also contributed to the decline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">However, the reduction in the growth rate of capital deepening can probably be seen as the flip side of the employment-rich growth which the euro area has experienced over recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">This reflects an environment of wage moderation and progress with labour market reforms which may have partly reversed the earlier trend to substitute labour, which had become more expensive due to wage increases outpacing productivity gains, in favour of capital, in the 1980s and early 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.88,0)">The flagging of labour productivity in the euro area contrasts sharply with the very positive developments in other major economies, most noticeably the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.36,0)">Up until the mid-1990s, labour productivity growth was lower in the US than in continental Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The second half of the 1990s saw, however, a period of sharp acceleration in labour productivity in the US, at that time seen by observers as permanent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In the eyes of many, this was driven primarily by innovations in the information and communication technology   sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.59,0)">The rate of growth of GDP in the euro area in the second half of the 1990s was significantly lower than in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Nonetheless, advocates of the new economy, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">believers in the radical implications that the new technologies have for potential growth, expected that similar developments would take place on this side of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The contributions from ICT to labour productivity growth come from three main sources: a) a direct impact from the production of ICT capital, b) an additional direct contribution from the use of ICT capital in the production of other goods and services, and c) possible indirect ‘spillover’ effects from the use of ICT capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">These spillover effects stem among other things, from the introduction of more advanced management techniques in production processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">When comparing the euro area with other major industrialised economies, we see that the direct contribution from ICT capital increased everywhere between 1980 and 1995 and between 1995 and 2005, but remained at a higher level in the United States than in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">In this respect, it is commonly acknowledged that the higher TFP growth, in particular in the US, reflects at least partly the spillovers from the development and adoption of ICT technologies as a so-called “general purpose technology” that affects the entire production sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.91,0)">When looking at euro area productivity at sectoral level, we do not find any immediate evidence for such spillover effects in the non-high-tech ICT producing sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.59,0)">First, the performance of traditional non-high-tech manufacturing industries deteriorated significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.25,0)">They are responsible for most of the labour productivity slowdown in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.77,0)">Second, the performance of non-high-tech services remained weak.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Certainly, their contribution in relative terms is not as sizeable as that of traditional manufacturing industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.04,0)">However, this should be little consolation, as in absolute terms, labour productivity in these services industries has remained subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The question is then: why have there been no gains from the more intensive use of ICT in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, there is another twist to this question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">Recent data and analysis conducted for the US may suggest that the large gains in labour productivity growth during the second half of the 1990s and the early years of the new century are evidence of a one-off event rather than of sustainable labour productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is important to know if this was indeed the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Economic policies to foster sustainable growth It is probably uncontroversial to say that any increase in our economic and corporate wealth over the long run depends on innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Following Schumpeter’s definition, innovation refers mainly to the introduction of new goods, new methods of production, the opening of new markets, the procurement of new sources of supply and the introduction of new organisational schemes and management practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Putting aside the opening of new markets and, to a certain extent, the procurement of new supplies, innovation goes hand in hand with new ideas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">History has taught us that Archimedes devised his famous principle while in the bath.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">His “Eureka!” moment is commonly used as an example by those who suggest that inspiration plays the key role in the development of new ideas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.41,0)">Many others, however, disagree and regard scientific discoveries as the outcome of the combined effort of large communities of scientists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">It is my view that in Europe today we are not waiting for people to come up with good ideas while in the bath, but instead we expect governments to create an environment in which innovation thrives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">I think this requires governments to draw up policies that support economic freedom and a vibrant, growth-creating private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.66,0)">This requires an acknowledgement that undermining economic incentives and freedom is detrimental to entrepreneurial activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Allow me next to elaborate further on what should constitute a growth-friendly economic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The role played by education and research and development is key for innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.68,0)">This is a known fact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">A highly educated labour force improves the prospects for innovation and facilitates the adoption of new technologies from abroad.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.57,0)">However, in translating this principle into policy, some puzzles emerge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.82,0)">Recent research shows that there is no clear link between spending on education and the performance of pupils in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">This issue needs to be explored further as it may suggest that there might be scope for efficiency gains in education or, in other words, it is the quality of education spending which matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The key role of R&D in promoting growth is also a known fact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">It is also fairly uncontroversial to suggest that promoting R&D investment includes a better use of public procurement, more innovation-friendly regulation and stepping up the provision of targeted fiscal incentives to the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The level of R&D funding by the private sector in Europe lags that in other modern economies, most notably the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Finland is currently the only country in the euro area which has achieved the Lisbon target of 3% spending on R&D.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">Adequate systems to support R&D are of course not only a quantitative issue; increasing the efficiency of research at the same time is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Further policy measures to correct this situation need to be found.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Another key ingredient of a growth-friendly economic environment is well-functioning product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">Flexible labour markets benefit both firms and workers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Contractual flexibility is essential in a world of technological change and globalisation where workers can no longer count on job security.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">It means greater opportunities to move into new positions and it leads to higher employment security.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Education and training systems need to help workers master transitions between jobs and keep up with technological developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Flexible labour markets and efficient active labour market policies contribute to shorter periods of unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.66,0)">Longer periods could lead to a decline in a worker’s skills and productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.79,0)">Lack of flexibility in labour markets also discourages innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.86,0)">The combined effect of hiring and firing costs and the type of industrial relations regime have an impact on in-house training incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.21,0)">Labour market regulations may also have an impact on participation rates, a fact which should not be overlooked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">An environment where competitive forces reduce price margins will in turn encourage entrepreneurs to allocate their resources in the most efficient way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Numerous economic studies have documented the positive link between competition and innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">However, the nature of this link is not simple and we should deepen our knowledge of a number of issues here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">First, recent empirical evidence on the impact of mergers on productivity growth suggests that they may induce welfare-improving efficiency gains, which may conflict with regulators’ concerns about their negative impact on competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Second, there is evidence that for some countries there might be an inverted U-shaped relationship between competition and incentives to invest in innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.05,0)">This means that high as well as low levels of competition may discourage innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This, in my view, may simply be a sign of the international reallocation of capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Studies that have indicated an inverted U-shaped relationship usually employ price cost margins as a measure of competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.25,0)">In traditional industries, such as textiles, these have been trending downwards as a result of the increasing competition from developing economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">The pressures exerted by developing economies on traditional industries in developed countries are mounting, suggesting that it may be also advisable to promote economic policies which encourage the development of high-tech industries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">Another key ingredient of a growth-friendly economic environment is, of course, a sound macroeconomic policy setting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In particular, recent studies have emphasised the benefits of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.46,0)">Economic research has shown that higher average inflation has a negative impact on growth and welfare, while higher inflation volatility has a negative impact on welfare and, most likely, a negative effect on growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Maintaining price stability is the best contribution the ECB can make to promoting growth in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude by saying that Europe is reforming its economy so as to adapt to the challenges of globalisation, technological change and ageing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Considerable progress has been achieved, as reflected in the significant rise in employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Monetary Union has been effective – and very successful – in supporting growth through a credible monetary policy which creates a stable macroeconomic environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">It has lowered financing costs for a number of euro area countries by reducing risk premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The challenge now is to raise the level of productivity growth in all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">I am very grateful to the Banque de France and The Conference Board for joining forces with us to convene this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">We share a common interest in learning more about the mechanisms that promote the creation of economic and corporate wealth in Europe, and we all hope to learn a lot from this event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">I wish you all a fruitful discussion.</span><span style="background-color:
