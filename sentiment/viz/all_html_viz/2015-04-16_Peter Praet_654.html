    <h2> Intervention by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, during a panel on “The elusive pursuit of inflation” at the IMF Spring Meetings Seminar, Washington, 16 April 2015 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Peter Praet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.38,0)"> Price stability: a sinking will-o'-the-wisp?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Intervention by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, during a panel on “The elusive pursuit of inflation” at the IMF Spring Meetings Seminar, Washington, 16 April 2015 Ladies and Gentlemen  , I would like to thank the IMF for inviting me to this excellent workshop and to be part of such a distinguished panel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.72,0)">Introduction Almost 50 years ago Milton Friedman famously described the Phillips curve as a "will-o-the-wisp".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.94,0)">When he first used this metaphor, he was isolated in the macroeconomist community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.76,0)">But in a matter of few years – and after a few bad inflation surprises that were hard to square with the solid and steady Phillips curve formalism that was embedded in many models of the time – his vision became less alien.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.24,0)">Many of his colleagues started to admit that the Phillips curve was an extraordinarily frail platform for central banks to base monetary reflation experiments on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.4,0)">Indeed, at that point, Friedman had been joined by the so-called Neo-Classicals to demonstrate that what might appear as a steady association between price pressures and economic slack could in fact represent a collection of disequilibrium points which could only be maintained by monetary policy perpetuating the disequilibrium through ever-more aggressive expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.78,0)">Arthur Okun, one of the founding fathers of post-war stabilisation theories, was more cutting in his assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,147.65,0)">On observing a scatterplot of Phillips curve observations over the stagflation decade of 1970-1980 – which defied theory as it showed a positive   correlation between inflation and unemployment – he remarked that the curve resembled "an unidentified flying object."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.43,0)">I think it is safe to say that few economists at that time, at either end of the macro-theory spectrum, could have imagined that a destabilisation of the Phillips curve could occur, symmetrically, in both directions – that is, on a sustained decelerating as well as accelerating path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">That today a no less influential observer and global policy actor than the IMF itself entertains this possibility makes it sufficiently important for us central bankers to consider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Therefore, I am grateful for this opportunity to clarify my own thinking on this topic, particularly in the context of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.94,0)">Is sustained disinflation indeed a realistic possibility?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.29,0)">I believe it is not – that is, unless at least one of the following three conditions holds: the structural connection between inflation and unemployment vanishes, with the Phillips curve interpreted as the aggregate supply condition in the spirit of the New Keynesians.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.06,0)">This would imply that inflation becomes unreactive to economic slack; the financial transmission channel remains blocked, and at the zero lower bound monetary policy cannot maintain sufficient traction on real activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.21,0)">In the context of the Phillips curve, the measure of economic slack becomes uncontrollable; macroeconomic policymakers lose their commitment to their stabilisation mandates and renounce control over demand conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.52,0)">Consequently, inflation is left to move freely in the Phillips curve space, being driven only by pure sunspots.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.03,0)">To bring forward my conclusions, I do not see evidence to support the first two conditions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">In terms of  , the inflation/unemployment connection remains intact – in fact, it has probably strengthened precisely in those economies where labour market slack has exerted a disproportionate influence on the weak euro area-wide inflation trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">As for  , the financial transmission channel has largely been restored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.79,0)">In the wake of the sovereign crisis, frictions in financial intermediation had increased on account of heightened risk aversion and driven a large wedge between the risk-free interest rate and the cost at which private borrowers could borrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.7,0)">Credit standards tightened despite the ECB's policy orientation to loosen its stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.29,0)">Over the last year, however, these wedges have largely disappeared and financing conditions have fallen in line with our policy intentions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Turning to  , there is certainly no lack of commitment on the part of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">I believe that the ECB has demonstrated the necessary awareness when confronted with a downward shift in realised and anticipated inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Furthermore, it acted with the requisite force to address those concerns and to leave no doubt about its commitment to delivering price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Other economic policy makers, however, now need to meet the challenge with the same degree of determination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">In particular, they should view the current loose credit conditions as a historical opportunity to launch policy initiatives that would be far more difficult to enact in a less supportive environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me elaborate on these thoughts in some more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.15,0)">II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">A flat Phillips curve A key enabling condition for sustained disinflation is the presence of a totally flat Phillips curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.46,0)">On first reading, this concept may sound somewhat counterintuitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">After all, a vast literature has adduced that a flat Phillips curve is proof that central banks have been, and will continue to be, successful at both macroeconomic and inflation stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.95,0)">Indeed, John Roberts has argued this point particularly forcefully and cites the influence of the Federal Reserve’s stabilisation policies on US inflation dynamics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.36,0)">But a negatively sloped Phillips curve – in the inflation/unemployment space – is a precondition for central banks to exercise monetary control in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.55,0)">When the slope of the Phillips curve approaches zero, the inflation process becomes impervious to monetary policy interventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.66,0)">The NAIRU which divides regimes of accelerating inflation from decelerating inflation loses significance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.29,0)">In other words, any level of unused capacity becomes consistent with any rate of inflation and the inflation target ceases to exert its gravitational pull on inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.24,0)">Indeed, why should expectations gravitate around the central bank’s target if the central bank itself cannot correct an inflation deviation by steering the level of economic slack to the appropriate level and, thereby, bring inflation back to target?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.21,0)">As inflation expectations set the intercept that determines the height of the Philips curve in the inflation/unemployment space, in this hypothetical case, nothing can prevent the curve from sinking in an uncontrolled way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.9,0)">While it is a matter of dispute whether and where that sinking process would end, it would certainly pull inflation away from levels that are consistent with central banks' mandates and with macroeconomic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.55,0)">Let me make an incidental remark here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.99,0)">The major historical episode of unanchored inflation expectations, at the start of the 1970s, which ultimately opened the door to a decade characterised by bouts of double-digit inflation, occurred precisely at a time when the Phillips curve was thought to have become flat and policymakers saw wage and price-setting as having become insensitive to economic slack.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.69,0)">This perspective, which contrasted sharply with Milton Friedman's famous dictum that "inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon", led the Fed and other central banks to lend their support to measures such as wage and price controls rather than monetary solutions to address inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.07,0)">My own view is that I do not see signs of a disconnection between inflation and unemployment in the data for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">There are three observations that lead me to this position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">First, various estimates of the euro area Phillips curve slope show that while the slope has varied over time, in recent years it has steepened  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.71,0)">There is no agreed upon functional form of the Phillips curve, and our confidence that estimates using clouds of points in an inflation/economic slack space can capture the structural elasticity attached to slack in the conceptual Phillips curve, is indeed quite limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Nonetheless, using different measures of unused capacity to at least hedge against mis-specification risks, we obtain estimates which all indicate that there has been an increased responsiveness of inflation to economic slack in recent years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">If I interpret this evidence in a deep parametric way, I tentatively conclude that the slope of the Phillips curve is currently around 0.2.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">This implies that a 1 percentage point increase in economic slack would, on average, lower inflation excluding food and energy by about 0.2 of a percentage point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.15,0)">And in fact, this relationship measurably increases if one adjusts the headline rate of unemployment for those who have become detached from the labour market for a long time, and who are likely to exert only a mild amount of downward pressure on wage and price formation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Robert Gordon documents a similar result for the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.32,0)">As I mentioned above, there is some evidence that the Phillips curve has steepened in particular in some of the so-called euro area periphery countries, where lawmakers have actively reformed local labour market institutions and deficient demand has promoted a protracted period of wage moderation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.48,0)">There are of course many caveats to interpreting this data: lining up a time sequence of dots in the inflation/unemployment or wage growth/unemployment space and using the slope of that line to draw conclusions for the Phillips curve elasticity is hazardous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Through time, an economy could be moving along a steady Phillips curve, or Phillips curve could be shifting in the space.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.12,0)">And the shift could be due to a host of factors: a revision in inflation expectations for example, or a permanent or temporary change in wage and inflation mark-ups.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Incidentally, this latter factor – a temporary reallocation of wage negotiating power between employers and job-seekers – appears to be particularly relevant once the recovery has moved beyond its initial phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.48,0)">Evidence suggests that the relationship between inflation and labour market slack can be weakened not only during a recession but also in the early phase of a recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.84,0)">While the decline in euro area wage growth during the recession was limited due to downward nominal wage rigidities, in the early phase of the recovery wage growth may remain subdued as a result of “pent-up wage restraint”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.31,0)">In other words, the wage adjustment which did not occur during the recession may cause employers to initially curtail wage increases as they do not see a need to attract suitably qualified employees by wage incentives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">However, once this pent-up wage restraint has been absorbed, wages should begin to rise at a more rapid pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.46,0)">Discriminating across such null hypotheses is hard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.3,0)">But with these caveats in mind, a study by Banca d’Italia finds, for example, that the Phillips curve has undergone a structural break in both Spain and Italy, and for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.53,0)">First, nominal price rigidities have declined, possibly on account of the impact of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.88,0)">Again, this result can be interpreted in a variety of ways, including the idea that a temporary destabilisation of inflation expectations at some point started to influence wage contracts and produced a parallel drift in the curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">The second factor is a higher elasticity of consumer prices to the output gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The underlying reason mentioned in the study is changes in the price setting behaviour of firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.7,0)">This reflects the lower number of firms in the market in the aftermath of the deep recession and the reduction in strategic complementarities in price setting that this leaner retail sector brings about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This latter factor indeed comes very close to a New Keynesian type interpretation of the higher sensitivity of inflation to the underlying economic conditions, where different degrees of strategic complementarities in price setting can indeed be viewed as influencing the coefficient attached to slack   in the Phillips curve condition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This evidence could tentatively support the contention that what is observed in the data is indeed a structural shift.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.54,0)">It is important to remember that a steep  Phillips curve is a curse for inflation stability on the way down, when cyclical unemployment is on the rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">But it is a blessing when unemployment is being re-absorbed, as the revival in business activity places more intense upward pressures on prices and thus helps nudge inflation back toward its target level more rapidly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.97,0)">The second reason why I do not see signs of a disconnection between inflation and unemployment in the euro area is that – echoing a point also raised by Robert Gordon – the inflation process is occasionally subject to short-term spells of inertial drift, when supply side shocks hit repeatedly and cause serial downward inflation surprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.43,0)">Five years ago this phenomenon was invoked to explain the "missing deflation" in the post-Lehman world of mass worker dismissals, when realised inflation turned out consistently higher and stickier than forward looking macro models were predicting on the basis of the observed levels of unused capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.6,0)">Today, the delayed adjustment of the same inertial process is probably producing a symmetric case of "missing reflation".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.94,0)">In other words, a sequence of negative commodity price surprises may be dampening the reflationary effect of the economic recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.98,0)">Still, the possibility that inflation may occasionally be driven by spells of backward-looking dynamics does not mean that downward drifts – in both observed and expected inflation – should necessarily be looked through by the monetary authorities, as self-correcting and hence policy irrelevant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.94,0)">In fact, I will advocate the opposite view later when I turn to the role of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">What I want to say here is the following: provided the appropriate policy response has been put in place to ward off serious risks of nominal de-anchoring, any outbreak of adaptive expectations will be transient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.4,0)">When the adaptive expectation rule of both households and firms starts to perform badly in the face of strengthening business conditions, they will switch back to expecting price stability in line with central banks' numerical mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The third factor behind my assertion is that the flow of incoming survey data indicates a turnaround in inflationary pressures in line with the cyclical upturn, as evidenced for example by the latest PMI data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Both output and input prices as well as European Commission survey data on selling prices have rebounded since the turn of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Looking ahead, the weaker euro exchange rate as well as the continued closing of the output gap will be key drivers in supporting the upward inflationary trajectory for euro area inflation back towards our aim of below but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">III.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.84,0)">Re-integration of financial transmission Another possible condition for a situation of sustained disinflation is that monetary policy losses traction over the economy in the presence of disrupted transmission mechanisms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In the euro area our monetary policy response has indeed focused on two tracks: engineering an appropriately expansionary stance, while simultaneously repairing the monetary policy transmission mechanism so that this stance reaches euro area firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.64,0)">The first track has seen us progressively cut rates, resulting in the ECB being one of only a handful of central banks whose short-term rates have gone into negative territory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">The power that negative rates have had in propagating our policy stimulus has been striking, for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.84,0)">First, because a negative interest rate policy can to a certain extent be seen as a substitute for quantitative interventions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">Bringing the overnight interest rate to a negative level already in June last year de facto meant that we started generating effects – again to a certain extent – that one expects to see under quantitative policies, eight months before we expanded our purchase programmes on a large scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And second, because a negative interest rate policy is indeed a complement to a quantitative programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Let me explain both points in some more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.36,0)">When the short-term interest rate falls to zero, the yield curve tends to steepen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.66,0)">This phenomenon is a mechanical consequence of agents revising their interest rate expectations at the zero lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Long-term interest rates are to a large extent driven by expectations of the future evolution of the short-term interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">If agents – looking forward – can only expect the short-term interest rate to rise in the future from a zero level, because they think zero is the lower bound, then the long-term interest rate will be determined on the basis of a probability distribution that is skewed toward positive numbers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.2,0)">This is what causes the term structure to steepen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.17,0)">Now, if agents can be convinced that the lower bound for the short-term interest rate is not zero but can be made negative, then this problem is likely to become less severe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In fact, over the summer and the autumn we have seen our long-term interest rates starting to react to our negative interest rate policy in much the same direction as long-term interest rates have reacted to QE in other countries and, subsequently, in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">We also expect the negative rate to complement – and in fact empower – the expanded asset purchase programme that we decided in January.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.22,0)">A negative rate on bank reserves is an inducement for banks selling securities to the Eurosystem, or receiving an inflow of reserves and deposits as a consequence of central bank purchases, to lend these money balances on and avoid the tax that is paid on them otherwise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">In other words, we expect an increase in the velocity of circulation of cash reserves – another way to describe an acceleration in the portfolio rebalancing effect that is a key component in the transmission of asset purchases to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Turning to the second track of our policy – the repair of the monetary policy transmission mechanism – the flow of data indicates that our credit easing measures taken last summer are improving the pass-through of our accommodative stance to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.0,0)">The nominal cost of bank borrowing for euro area NFCs has declined sharply, with some convergence across countries  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The March 2015 Bank Lending Survey also shows that euro area banks have continued with their net easing of loans to NFCs with a further decline in the disparity across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">These improvements in net easing were mainly driven by the improved cost of funding – across all main market instruments – and balance sheet conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">In contrast with the past, the last six months have shown that banks are now passing along their cheaper funding conditions to their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Our credit easing measures have supported this process by generating competitive pressures, which in turn makes banks’ lending behaviour more responsive to their funding situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.34,0)">As lending rates have declined in tandem with market rates, the demand for loans has also continued to pick-up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Improvements in the net demand for loans to NFCs persisted into the first quarter of this year across almost all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">This indicates that, by reducing the interest rate charged on the marginal loan, a bank makes the investment project of a firm which requires the marginal loan profitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.99,0)">It follows from this that the more lending rates are reduced, the greater the number of investments that will break even and consequently, the more investors will ask for loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Looking ahead, the indications bode well for future economic activity, as euro area banks expect both a further easing of credit standards and a continued increase of net NFC loan demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In sum, the monetary impulse is being passed along the entire credit pipeline, including via banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">IV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Policy reaction functions When all the structural preconditions are in place for central banks to influence short-term real activity and limit excessive fluctuations in the rate of inflation from targets – namely a negative Phillips curve coefficient and a viable transmission mechanism – a sustained period of disinflation, if this is possible at all, can only emerge if monetary policy facilitates it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.43,0)">However, present day central banks have little scope to show forbearance when price stability is at risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.57,0)">Tolerating inflation destabilisation is not an option for them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Modern central banks have two strong antidotes at their disposal to avoid this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">First, their robust monetary policy frameworks prescribe the delivery of price stability within a policy-relevant horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">I stress this qualification as it is a key element.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">To be sure, the time horizon for central banks to normalise inflation cannot be preset, by statute, unconditionally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.52,0)">Indeed, in a vast part of the world where central banks are assigned numerical objectives for price stability the stabilisation horizon is not defined in rigid calendar-time form, but is left rather flexible for central banks to determine according to the nature of shocks that cause inflation to deviate from target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.87,0)">At the same time, a central bank which allows itself too much discretion over the time horizon when inflation should return to its target would de facto be claiming authority over redefining its monetary policy objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.03,0)">This would be manifestly inappropriate, probably illegitimate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.03,0)">Central banks know that if they lack a verifiable commitment to control inflation over a horizon for which the public retains some visibility, this can result in inflation expectations becoming "unanchored".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">To go back to a point I made earlier, it is in this spirit that a central bank may choose to react vigorously to supply-side shocks so that it can restore the public's faith in the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.25,0)">Second, and as a corollary, present day central banks do not indulge in the self-absolving notion that monetary policy has reached its limits and that further actions would be fruitless.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.4,0)">Historically this sort of pessimism about the potency of monetary policy has led to policy paralysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.21,0)">To make matters worse, this idea was often combined in central banking circles with the conviction that those authorities with control over income, structural and fiscal policies should be principally responsible for reviving the economy and countering deflation risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.32,0)">In both the 1930s and 1970s as well as in the early 2000s in Japan, these counterproductive beliefs led to policy inaction which ultimately resulted in enormous harm being inflicted on their economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Today's central banks have learned the lesson from these episodes and do not wait for others to move first.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The ECB’s actions reflect this learning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.62,0)">Many observers expected that the EU environment of diffuse macroeconomic authority would lead to strategic paralysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Instead, the ECB has risen to its responsibility of ensuring control over inflation in the medium term, and has responded vigorously to any risks of inflation expectations becoming unanchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">As a result, our expanded asset purchase programme has had three tangible effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.01,0)">It has prompted a reassessment of inflation prospects as priced in inflation protection contracts: the steady decline of breakeven and inflation swap forwards which occurred in the recent past have not only halted, but have reversed at all horizons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.23,0)">The implemented measures have also flattened the nominal term structure for safe as well as riskier fixed income securities at the longest maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.74,0)">And as a consequence of this, they have led to a drop in real rates across the entire spectrum of term contracts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">V. The importance of other stakeholders Nonetheless, it is clear that all stakeholders must also play their part in ensuring a swift and sustained recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">The current environment where the real interest rate is below the real GDP growth rate is one that is, as I already intimated, very supportive and ripe for undertaking investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">But it is also not without risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.73,0)">It is now below a range of estimates for real potential growth rates and, in fact, below the zero line throughout the maturities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This chart admits two stylised interpretations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.58,0)">In the first interpretation, the movements of the forward real curve are just a mirror image of the compression in term premia achieved via our expanded asset purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.92,0)">The fact that the forward real curve has continued its descent observed since 2014 may be the result of the term premium compression, given the anticipation   and actual execution   of central bank purchases of securities held in price-inelastic portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Indeed, the term premium is part of the real remuneration that investors demand in order to hold on to their investments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.32,0)">In the second interpretation, long-term forward real rates are a measure of an equilibrium “norm”, rather than a reflection of a monetary-policy induced compression of term premia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Another way to look at the outer maturities along the real forward curve is to interpret these rates as a market measure of the equilibrium real rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">That is, they reflect the markets’ view of the real cost of borrowing that can be sustained by an economy that is neither overheating nor decelerating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Indeed, barring preferred habitat and extreme price inelasticities on the side of potential sellers, at those maturities all shocks should have dissipated, and the economy should be expected to have returned to a sustainable path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.91,0)">This interpretation is less benign than the first one I advanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.7,0)">If one interprets long-term real forward rates as a measure of the equilibrium rate, the comparison of these persistently negative rates with the growth rate of potential suggests that the economy may be dynamically inefficient and expected to remain so for a very long time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.8,0)">What conclusions can one draw for policies  ?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">If the first interpretation is correct and one interprets long-term real rates as influenced by term premia and monetary policy, then – by bringing the real cost of long-term borrowing below potential growth – monetary policy can lower the “return bar” at which investment projects break-even and become profitable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Provided investment reacts to this very strong price incentive, the imbalance will be rectified at some point, and real rates will catch up with   potential rate over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">If the second interpretation is correct, we are in the fortunate position that the policy conclusions are not so different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The necessary policies that are required to capitalise on the low interest rate environment are the same policies that can repair dynamic inefficiency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">In essence, no matter how you read the   What is needed is to boost growth via increased investment, as investment not only creates current demand but future supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Public investment on infrastructure, if sufficient fiscal space exists, as well as on education and training can promote a new wave of innovations and put more of the labour force to work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">At the same time, removing barriers that restrict the reallocation of workers across firms while enhancing the effectiveness of national competition authorities to drive out rent seeking behaviour would reduce market functioning impediments and, thereby, increase the profitability of investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The European capital union would greatly facilitate firms wishing to undertake cross-border investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Ultimately, a higher potential will create the conditions for a rising equilibrium rate and will pave the way for monetary policy normalisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">V. Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">Euro area inflation declined substantially over the past year, but as I have just outlined, all the indications are there to support the view that inflation will gradually return to our definition of price stability of below but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">While the debate over the Phillips curve is likely continue for decades and beyond, there can be no doubt that monetary policy is playing a key role in helping to make this return of inflation to our objective possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">However, it is now up to governments to seize on this opportunity to ensure that the cyclical recovery becomes permanent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Annex   The choice of priors is not optimized.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.95,0)">The unemployment gap is inverted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.49,0)">The last observation is February 2015.  , Monetary Policy and Inflation Dynamics, International Journal of Central Banking, International Journal of Central Banking, vol.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.68,0)">2 , September, 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Gordon, R., “The Philips Curve is Alive and well and the NAIRU During the slow recovery”, NBER Working Paper, No 19390, August 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Riggi, M. and Venditti, F., Surprise!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.78,0)">Euro area inflation has fallen, Banca D’Italia Occasional Papers, September 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Of course, one should not overlook the fact that, even in this benign case, there are risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.46,0)">In a world where the real interest rate is below the growth rate of the economy a self-perpetuating asset price inflation dynamic can become a reality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Borrowing to purchase assets that are limited or rigid in supply – for example real estate - may become a more attractive investment due to the expectation of increasing prices than investing in reproducible capital with a lower return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Indeed it is in such a setting, combined with some additional very strong assumptions, that a sustainable “rational bubble” as depicted by Tirole emerges.</span>
