    <span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)"> The future of euro governance: how to contain imbalances and preserve financial stability Speech by Vítor Constâncio, Vice-President of the ECB, The ECB and its Watchers, Frankfurt am Main, 9 July 2010 Introduction It is a great pleasure to participate at this conference for the first time in my official capacity as the ECB’s Vice-President.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">The "ECB and Its Watchers" conference was a pioneering initiative and the fact that other central banks have chosen to emulate it is surely a powerful tribute to the usefulness of the event‘s format.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In my remarks today, I want to address some of the problems that the financial crisis has created for the governance of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The euro area has responded adequately to the challenges that have arisen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Even though one might occasionally speak of some procrastination, which is understandable in a complex framework integrating several countries, important and bold decisions have been taken and new reform processes have been launched.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">After the Lehman failure, we responded with the necessary liquidity provision to a financial sector hampered by clogged monetary and financial markets; fiscal policy implemented the necessary stimulus programmes; and the banking sector received indispensable and very extensive government support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Furthermore, Europe participated actively in the international efforts to design and adopt new regulations for the financial sector and has embarked on a thorough reform of its own regulatory and supervisory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The forthcoming establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board   and three European Supervisory Authorities will address both the need for truly harmonised European regulation and the coordination required for a more effective European supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">The public sector support for demand and the stabilisation of the banking sector contributed to the avoidance of a depression and launched an incipient economic recovery that was gaining strength in the first quarter of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">That was the moment when financial markets started to test the cohesiveness of the euro area and whether the setup was more than some kind of a vast multilateral currency board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.8,0)">This new chapter of the financial crisis, which threatens to weaken – but not kill – the recovery, has been named the sovereign risk phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.29,0)">This has thus far been something of a misnomer, since some important countries with significant public finance imbalances have not been affected and only a few more vulnerable members of the euro area merited the attention of the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The European response made clear that our economic and monetary union was more than a precarious arrangement among nation-states and stands as an important pillar of the European integration project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">Proof of this can be found in the package of loans with stringent conditionality put together for Greece, in the creation of an European Financial Stability Facility with 500 billion euro, and in the adoption of further non-standard measures to defend the monetary transmission mechanism for the whole euro area by buying securities and providing liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">We did this in full consistency with our mandate to deliver price stability, and with the determination to overcome the unfounded misunderstanding that purchases of securities could in some inexplicable way be more inflationary than the use of the same securities in regular repurchase agreements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">What counts, of course, are the overall development of primary liquidity and the management of short-term money market rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.45,0)">Incidentally, measured in terms of the monetary base, provision of liquidity has decreased from €1256.8 billion on 7 May to the current level of €1149.8 billion and Eonia went up from 0.321 to 0.398 yesterday.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">At the same time, market inflation expectations are well anchored bellow 2% up to 10 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.97,0)">Apart from the determination shown in taking appropriate measures, Europe has also recognised that the current episode of the crisis points to the existence of real problems with respect to public finance imbalances and has even exposed some institutional weaknesses in our framework for monetary union, which need to be corrected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Consequently, Europe has now embarked on the preparation of significant reforms of the euro area governance in the context of the Task Force created under the leadership of President Van Rompuy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Every good reform starts with a good understanding of the problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The fundamental point relates to the issue of imbalances in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.3,0)">By imbalances, I do not mean just fiscal imbalances, but also imbalances stemming from private sector behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I will concentrate my remarks on the issue of imbalances, starting by analysing their causes and the necessary policies to correct and, preferably, avoid them in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Finally, I will draw conclusions as to what the experience implies for economic policy and economic governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.8,0)">Imbalances and adjustments in a monetary union There are severe fiscal imbalances in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Triggered, in particular, by developments in Greece, markets have dramatically reassessed their view of fiscal positions leading to sharp rises in bond yield spreads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.33,0)">This stands in sharp contrast to the markets’ assessment of sovereign risk in euro area countries prior to the financial crisis, which can reasonably be characterised as one of “benign neglect”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">It is indisputable that fiscal imbalances of the kind we have seen in some euro area countries need to be corrected in a timely and convincing manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This has been recognised, as fiscal packages have been introduced in Ireland, Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal over the last few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Moreover, in order to give countries breathing space to carry out fiscal adjustment, unprecedented support measures have been introduced at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.79,0)">Fiscal deficits, however, are not the only macroeconomic imbalances we can see when we look across euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,168.97,0)">A number of indicators provide prima facie evidence of private sector imbalances where high indebtedness and excessive leverage have also developed over the years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.05,0)">In several countries, it was predominantly the increase in net private borrowing requirements that was responsible for growing current account deficits, which are large in some countries and have widened since the start of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.77,0)">In 2008, some 8 of the 16 euro area countries had a current account deficit ratio above 5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In 1999, only 2 countries exceeded the 5% mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.92,0)">In some   of the countries with current account deficits, there were also sharp increases in domestic asset prices, particularly house prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.04,0)">While house prices declined in Germany between 1999 and 2008, there was an average annual increase of more than 10% in Spain and Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.13,0)">Other related symptoms include rapid credit growth and a build-up of private sector debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.91,0)">From a methodological point of view, I have to point out that much of the current discussion is frequently too narrowly focused on a limited and simplistic set of indicators   in a partial equilibrium context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.64,0)">There are also those who seem to think that the problems are confined only to fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.39,0)">A spree of partial equilibrium analysis has been contaminating the debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.58,0)">To give an example of the importance of the general equilibrium approach: in simplistic accounts, rising current account deficits are often seen as being “caused” by losses in competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">But it should not be forgotten that the co-movement between the current account deficit and measures of the “real exchange rate” reflect the joint response of two endogenous variables to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In some cases the imbalances could be considered, up to a point, an equilibrium response of the economy to certain shocks, which does not necessarily warrant a policy reaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.54,0)">Two types of shocks that could be associated to such a development, could be, first, the permanent effect on the cost of financing and capital stemming from entering a new regime of low inflation and, second, the real convergence expected to happen in catching-up countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.23,0)">In benign scenarios, the apparent imbalances are largely self-correcting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.7,0)">Eventually, the inter-temporal budget constraints will induce consumers and firms to cut their expenditures, thereby reducing the current account imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.44,0)">These adjustments will be accompanied by movements in relative prices, as the economies concerned rebalance domestic and external demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.8,0)">The fact that some episodes of current account deficits and rising relative prices could be natural economic adjustments to shocks that hit the economy does not, of course, imply that all such episodes are benign, equilibrium phenomena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Looking at developments in a number of euro area countries over the past 11 years, we have enough evidence of private sector imbalances that cannot be explained by reference to benign equilibrium phenomena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,176.24,0)">How could such imbalances come about?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.65,0)">I think there are three plausible   explanations: First, expectations about growth seem to have become detached from reality and have indeed become excessively exuberant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">If we are willing to depart from the assumption of strictly rational expectations and to allow for phenomenon such as learning, it is easy to see how initial booms – justified by equilibrium phenomena – induce economic agents to expect that the strong growth will continue indefinitely  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In this regard, it is worth noting that most of the bubbles we have observed in history started in response to changes in fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.8,0)">A second factor is the behaviour of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.13,0)">At the global level, the period was one in which financial intermediaries around the world were engaging in excessive risk-taking behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.9,0)">This led to bad credit risk management and very loose credit conditions, which added fuel to the fire in the case of overheating economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.0,0)">Third, the standard adjustment mechanisms implied by theory seem not to have worked sufficiently well or sufficiently fast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.08,0)">In particular, the real appreciation channel seems to have been operating very slowly, and inflated animal spirits seems to have put in question the existence of the fully rational inter-temporal optimisers taken as given in many models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.74,0)">In addition, the public sector itself may also have been affected by exuberant expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">As a result, governments in some countries increased their expenditure and/or reduced taxes, expecting that the gains in output and increased revenues seen during the boom years would be permanent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.42,0)">Consequently, when these countries headed into a downturn, fiscal positions that looked healthy on the surface turned out to be precarious, deficits rose sharply and debt ratios moved along explosive trajectories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The financial crisis acted as a trigger to expose the fragilities that had been built up in earlier years and led to rapid reassessment on the part of economic agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Countries that have accumulated imbalances thus now face a long   process of adjustment to more warranted levels of spending and debt in both the public and the private sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.19,0)">A process of de-leveraging and balance sheet repairment will have to take place in several cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.53,0)">These adjustments will inevitably entail a period of low growth in domestic demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">This, in turn, will necessitate corrective adjustments in relative prices and wages in order to foster net exports and rebalance the economies in question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Eliminating the imbalances Even in the absence of explicit policy actions, we can expect a number of standard channels to start working, leading to a reduction of private sector imbalances and an eventual return of the economies to a more sustainable equilibrium pattern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.65,0)">The reassessment of future prospects by households and firms will induce them to adjust their expenditure plans downwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The resulting lower level of domestic demand will lead to lower imports, and thus serve to reduce the current account deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This mechanism is a more or less automatic response by agents to the changed environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">It is likely to be reinforced by the impact of banks’ endeavours to restore their balance sheets by, inter alia, curtailing lending and by government efforts to rectify fiscal imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.69,0)">In itself, the contraction of domestic demand brings strong downward pressure to bear on output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In order to counteract this effect, net exports will need to be pushed for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In this respect, the so-called competitiveness channel will also play a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.18,0)">Weaker demand will lead to lower wage and salary increases   via the usual Phillips-curve mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This will stimulate net exports, offsetting the effects of lower domestic demand on output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.38,0)">In the long run, the economy will be rebalanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.78,0)">However, given evidence of the sluggishness of wage and, to a lesser extent, price adjustments, this restoration of competitiveness could be a very protracted and painful process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This implies that policy has a crucial role to play in facilitating and speeding up the adjustment process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">In particular, policy action is needed in four areas: First, measures should be taken to increase wage flexibility and the adjustment of wages to appropriate levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">This could be achieved through measures to improve the functioning of labour markets with a view to enhancing wage flexibility and facilitating the transfer of workers from the non-traded to the traded sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In fact, we have already seen wage-setting developments in some European countries that many observers would have believed impossible just a few years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Second, the adoption of measures to increase productivity growth is necessary to facilitate adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Higher productivity growth will allow the affected countries to improve their gains in competitiveness for a given level of nominal wage growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This benefit comes on top of the improvement in living standards that increases in productivity generate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Achieving higher productivity growth requires comprehensive structural reforms aimed, in particular, at sheltered sectors of the economy where there is insufficient competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Third, convincing fiscal consolidation to redress the fiscal imbalances is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.93,0)">Given the impairment of the credibility of fiscal policy in many countries, postponing adjustment is simply no longer an option.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Markets need to be convinced right now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">This message is now well understood and, in recent months, we have seen sizeable fiscal adjustments in a number of euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">This is a very encouraging development, but it is essential to maintain the momentum and ensure that the new targets are met in the years ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Fourth, repairing the balance sheets of banks and making banks more resilient are crucial prerequisites for the resumption of growth and for financing the reallocation of resources from the non-traded to the traded sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Many policy initiatives have already been taken in this respect, ranging from the establishment of “bad banks” to injections of capital and government guarantees’ for bank debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Of course, the liquidity policy of the Eurosystem has played a crucial role in supporting the financing of the overall economy since August 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">At the same time, viewed from a longer-term perspective, effective regulation has a key role to play in strengthening the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Currently envisaged changes in the regulation of banks aim at making banks better internalise the cost of their risk-taking and impose heavier capital charges on their riskier positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">This will reduce the danger of excessive credit flows such as those seen in the pre-crisis period, which were - in hindsight - not sustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">It will also increase banks’ loss absorption capabilities by increasing the level and the quality of their capital buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The four points I have just mentioned relate to policy action to be taken in “deficit” countries in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">A natural question to ask at this point is what policy action could be taken to help eliminate imbalances in “surplus” countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There is a debate underway on this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Some commentators argue that surplus countries should pursue policies that are symmetric to those of the deficit countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">If deficit countries have to restrict their domestic demand through fiscal contraction or wage containment, then surplus countries should increase their domestic expenditure by engaging in fiscal expansion or wage increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.55,0)">This type of arguments can go too far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.85,0)">In some cases, there may be some room for manoeuvre, but even if it is ignored that the euro area is not a closed economy, so that all members have other markets to support their growth, it would not be right to ask countries to compromise unreasonably on their international competitiveness or to put the sustainability of their public finances at significant risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Still, it is true that a reduction of the current account deficits of some countries may, through the mechanics of the operation of a monetary union, imply a reduction of surpluses in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.19,0)">From a euro area-wide point of view, wage moderation in the deficit countries is a negative inflationary shock to the area as whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy, which focuses on price stability in the euro area as a whole, would take that development into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The resulting stance of monetary policy will affect wage and price developments in the surplus countries, aiding the adjustment in competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Similarly, the stance will affect demand in the surplus countries, again fostering adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">That said, there is scope for some supply side policy measures in surplus countries to facilitate adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In cases where the current account surpluses reflect structurally low consumption or limited domestic investment opportunities, structural reforms should be implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">The range of possibilities includes structural measures in the non-traded sectors, such as the deregulation of the services sector, for instance, thereby increasing productivity and growth, as well as changes in taxation to change incentives to spend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Avoiding imbalances in the future The experience of imbalances in the euro area in recent years is a convincing reminder that “prevention is better than cure”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Looking ahead, the key question is what can be done to prevent the emergence of imbalances in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">After the current crisis experience, the markets can be expected to better assess the differences in the risks to Monetary Union members and to increase both the spreads and the cost of capital when those risks start to rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Market discipline as a result of proper credit risk management can be an important mechanism for preventing the emergence of imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Policy measures are nevertheless required and are of the same nature of those that I have already mentioned with respect to the correction of the existing imbalances, in particular those with regard to fiscal policy and unit labour costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">After all, viewed from a macroeconomic perspective, the successful participation in a monetary union implies an anti-cyclical fiscal policy and an appropriate evolution of wage costs in line with the development of relative productivity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">I believe that two other policy points also deserve to be mentioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">First, I think that macro-prudential policy has an important role to play in preventing and/or mitigating the effects of imbalances in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The whole panoply of well-known analytical tools has to be used: sets of financial indicators, early-warning systems, stress tests, contagion models, macro-models that include the proper feedback between the financial sector and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Careful attention in this process must be paid to leverage indicators of the different types of economic agents: households, firms, banks and the state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Ensuring financial stability implies avoiding excessive debt and credit growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The idea of macro-prudential policy is not new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Rather, what has changed is the institutional framework in which these policies can be set in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In Europe, the establishment of the ESRB will provide the mechanism for identifying imbalances that endanger financial stability and create systemic risks at the level of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The ESRB membership reflects the composition of the 27 members of the General Council of the ECB and, although limited to issuing warnings and recommendations, the participation in the Board of one representative of the Commission and the three Chairs of the future European Supervisory Authorities ensures that proper action will follow the decisions of the ESRB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.75,0)">It is, in fact, the whole European System of Financial Supervision that will be responsible for guaranteeing that the functioning of both the financial sector and asset markets is not impaired to an extent that creates fundamental risks to the financing of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The second point with respect to policies appropriate for avoiding future imbalances relates to structural policies that are essential to promote productivity growth and to enhance the flexibility and competitiveness of the economies in question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">In many cases, the restoration of competitiveness does not depend only on correcting relative costs and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">In view of the structural shock of the import penetration emanating from very low-cost producers, what is necessary is to increase productivity and to change the productive structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">To ensure a smooth functioning of Monetary Union, the whole set of necessary policies should be employed in a consistent manner, both across individual policy areas and across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.08,0)">This has clearly not been the case in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Hence, there is an urgent need to improve policy-making at both the national and the area-wide level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">With respect to the latter, there is now a consensus on the need to reinforce economic governance within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">In this context, I would like to highlight the very ambitious proposals presented by the ECB, in the context of the Van Rompuy Task Force, for reinforcing the economic governance framework in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">The proposals of the Governing Council of the ECB point towards an overhaul of the institutional and rules-based framework for the surveillance of fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">On the institutional side, the Eurogroup should essentially be recognised as the guardian of fiscal sustainability, gaining new tasks and powers, including the review of national budgetary plans and the definition of ex ante fiscal policy guidelines for euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">This enhanced role of the Eurogroup should be coupled with an increase of the quasi-automaticity of the Excessive Deficit Procedure, reducing the use of discretion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Furthermore, one of the most important lessons that can be learned from the experience so far is that the implementation of the fiscal framework requires an effective regime of sanctions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">This can be achieved by applying the following principles: first, initiating the imposition of sanctions at an early stage; second, increasing the scale of the sanctions over time and in relation to the severity of the fiscal imbalance; and, third, applying a broader and more stringent range of sanctions, including financial, non-financial and procedural sanctions, which would deepen the degree of EU intervention in national fiscal policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">The overall framework would also be strengthened at the EU level by creating an independent fiscal agency within the Commission, which would act as a watchdog for the Eurogroup and the Council in the monitoring and assessment of national budgetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">At the national level, compliance would also be reinforced through the introduction in national legislation of fiscal rules and institutions that are consistent with the EU fiscal framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Another area for urgent reform relates to the establishment of an explicit and clear framework for the surveillance of competitiveness and the correction of economic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The ECB advocates in particular the introduction of targeted surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">On the basis of a clear and simple criterion, or a limited set of criteria, on key aspects of competitiveness linked to the functioning of EMU - based on measures of nominal competitiveness and other supporting indicators relating to the private and public sectors - countries would be categorised according to a colour-coded scheme of surveillance, which would be linked to increasing degrees of intrusiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Finally, the ECB also put forward proposals regarding the establishment of a euro area crisis management institution, which would have many of the features of the European Financial Stability Facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">From the ECB’s perspective, it is crucial to minimize the risk of moral hazard, which is always implicit in any ex ante rescue mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.52,0)">Institutional safeguards would include strong conditionality – reproducing the EU/IMF financial support to Greece – and graded sanctions in case of non-compliance with conditionality, escalating to a de facto loss of fiscal autonomy as the extreme form of sanction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Some of the ideas set out in the Commission’s recent Communication on enhancing economic policy coordination for growth and jobs   are close to the ECB’s proposals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">However, I think that that our proposals are somewhat more ambitious because we feel that the situation requires a quantum leap forward in strengthening the foundations of EMU and moving towards a deeper economic union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.75,0)">Conclusion We are now experiencing the full effects of the imbalances - both public and private sector - that have accumulated in euro area countries over past years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.73,0)">The euro area now faces two key challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The first is to take the necessary and difficult measures to restore fiscal positions and eliminate private sector imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">So far, this challenge seems to have been met.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">This can be seen, for example, in the decisive fiscal adjustment measures that have been adopted in the countries concerned and in the rapid adjustment of the private sector to the changed environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">It is essential to maintain the momentum and to restore sound and sustainable financial positions in both the private and the public sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The second challenge is to make sure that the lessons learned from this experience are well understood.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">We should put in place a framework of economic governance and a set of policies to prevent a recurrence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Here too, there is evidence of significant progress having been made in recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.06,0)">Some commentators argue that the imbalances that we have seen in the euro area have seriously weakened Monetary Union, even posing a threat to its survival.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I think that the opposite will turn out to be true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">When both challenges are met, the result will be a euro area that will be far more robust, with a more resilient financial system, and with sounder fiscal positions and a more balanced development across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">Once again, I would like to thank the organisers for their invitation to participate in this event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">I look forward to fruitful interaction with you over the next eight years.</span>
