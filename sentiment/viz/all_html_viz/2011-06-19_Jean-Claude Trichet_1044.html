    <span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)"> The euro area and its role in the global economy Remarks by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, upon reception of the 2011 Global Economy Prize, Kiel, 19 June 2011 It is a privilege to receive this Global Prize today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">I would like to thank the jury for this distinction, which honours the ECB and its staff.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Kiel has a long tradition of openness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">It has forged close ties with the rest of the world, ever since it joined the Hanseatic League in 1283.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Seven centuries later, Kiel is today part of the euro area, a vast economic continent, which is itself globally open and linked in many ways to the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It is about the euro area and of its role in the global economy that I would like to share with you some thoughts in receiving this Prize today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">How can we characterize the salient features of the euro area and of its role in the global economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And what are the challenges that need to be addressed in this context?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Three key aspects deserve attention in my view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">First, the euro area is amongst the most open of large economies in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The euro area’s trade relations with the rest of the world have grown appreciably since 1999, which underscores that the euro area is not a closed shop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The euro area’s trade openness has increased by about 9 percentage points over the first years of the euro, from roughly one-quarter to one-third of output, notably as a result of rapidly growing trade with vibrant economies, such as the new EU Member States or China.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The euro area is the world’s largest trading partner, after the European Union itself, accounting for about 14% of global exports and imports in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Economic and Monetary Union has fostered trade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Not only inside the euro area  , but even more so with the European Union as a whole and the rest of the world  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">The euro area is also very open financially, and increasingly so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Its international assets and liabilities averaged each around 170% of GDP in 2009, compared with roughly 140% of GDP for the US and 90% of GDP for Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">As financial globalisation unfolded in the last decade, the euro area’s external assets and liabilities have grown in tandem, by roughly 80 percentage points of GDP between 1999 and 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The euro area is a vast continent of more than 331 million citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">By population size, it is comparable with the other large economiy of the developed world, namely the United States, with a population of 310 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">In terms of economic output, the euro area is second only to the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It accounted for about 20% of world output in 2010, twice the share of Japan  , and somewhat less than the United States  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Second, the euro is a stable and credible currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">For over 12 years now, the European Central Bank –together with all national central banks– has been delivering what it is expected to deliver: price stability in the euro area as a whole over the medium-term, with an average annual inflation of less than 2%, but close to 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Since we are in Kiel, let me add that in Germany the average yearly inflation has been 1.5%, which is a better result than for any such 12 year period over the last 50 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">We have thereby been safeguarding the euro’s purchasing power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.03,0)">This has been achieved despite several headwinds to the European economy: oil prices went up; the internet bubble burst; violence and wars have raged in some parts of the world; and starting in mid-2007 we had to cope with the most severe global financial crisis in over 60 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Taken as a whole, the euro area performed soundly also when looking at other macroeconomic indicators, or comparing with other large developed economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Adjusted for differences in population growth, per capita GDP growth in the euro area over the last decade has been almost the same as in the United States, at about 1% per year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The dispersion of real GDP growth rates across euro area countries is comparable with the equivalent dispersion across U.S. states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">For instance, the difference between the fastest and slowest-growing U.S. states is not of a markedly different order of magnitude as that between euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Overall employment in the euro area increased by 14 million during the first twelve years, compared with a rise of about 8 million in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.94,0)">And the overall yearly public finance deficit in the euro area is presently about half that in the United States or in Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The IMF projects indeed the euro area’s fiscal deficit to reach 4.4% of GDP this year, against 10.8% of GDP in the U.S. and 10.0% in Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The euro’s international status is the outcome of market forces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">But one of the particular characteristics of the euro’s international role is to be markedly regional and strongest in economies with close geographical and institutional links to the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">The euro’s international role also displays a high degree of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">And the available factual evidence suggests that it has remained broadly unchanged since the outbreak of the global financial crisis, in particular.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">For instance, the euro accounted in 2010 for about one-quarter of disclosed foreign exchange reserves globally  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It also accounted for about one-quarter of the stock of international debt securities and for roughly 20% of foreign exchange turnover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Third, the euro area has a balanced current account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">As such, the euro area does not contribute to global imbalances, one of the main challenges facing the global economy and the world community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">It is worth stressing that the euro area is the relevant dimension to consider for a vast single currency and economic area with a common exchange rate and monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.82,0)">And there, the numbers are clear: the euro area current account balance averaged less than 0.1% of GDP over 2005-2007 before the global crisis broke out, according to IMF figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Moreover, the euro area current account is still projected by the Fund to be broadly balanced this year and the next up to 2015.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The picture is very different in other parts of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.42,0)">A concern is that after some partial reduction induced by the crisis, global imbalances are starting to widen again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.81,0)">This raises challenges for international monetary and financial cooperation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The euro area has a significant stake in effective global re-balancing, notably through sounder domestic policies worldwide which, in turn, would contribute to global external stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The global economy has a lot of homework to do if it is to address these challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">People of goodwill, inspired by the desire to keep the global economy “open, market-based, just and protective” will surely be needed to that end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Credit should therefore be given to initiatives such as the Global Economy Prize to encourage them to press ahead in that direction.</span>
