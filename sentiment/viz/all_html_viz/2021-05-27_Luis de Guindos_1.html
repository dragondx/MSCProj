    <span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)"> Climate change and financial integration Keynote speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the joint ECB and European Commission conference on “European Financial Integration and Stability” Frankfurt am Main, 27 May 2021 Introduction For Europe, financial integration and stability are two sides of the same coin – a symbiotic relationship where greater integration aids stability, and stability underpins greater integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,53.74,0)">Equally, financial fragmentation can exacerbate instability, as the global financial crisis clearly showed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.43,0)">Climate change – the topic of this afternoon’s session – poses an emerging threat to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Yet, as I will discuss in my remarks today, it also presents us with an opportunity to forge deeper integration in order to tackle this common challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Policies that foster stronger and more resilient financial integration within the euro area are needed more urgently than ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Financial integration in the euro area Let me begin with a quick recap of why financial integration matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">When a negative shock hits the whole euro area, monetary policy can act to mitigate the impact on output and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.94,0)">But when a shock hits an individual country or region – known as an asymmetric shock – other mechanisms are required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In this situation, financial integration can help mitigate the impact through improved public and private risk-sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.3,0)">Lower economic activity following the shock typically reduces the profitability of local banks and stymies credit creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Continued lending from other parts of the euro area can therefore help cushion the impact and support consumption and investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">In addition, holding foreign bonds – which are less affected by the asymmetric shock – helps maintain income and support domestic consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In the United States, these channels alleviate around 60% of the impact of state-level shocks on GDP growth, compared with just 20% in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.31,0)">Indeed, the contribution of credit smoothing in the euro area was negative during the global financial crisis as cross-border credit provision evaporated, worsening the recessions in the periphery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">During the pandemic there have also been sizeable swings in measures of financial integration, albeit more muted than during the financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.19,0)">Indicators based on the convergence of asset prices declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic, but then rebounded following the ECB’s announcement of substantial monetary accommodation and subsequent progress on European fiscal support packages  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.53,0)">Movements in quantity-based financial integration indicators, which reflect cross-border asset holdings, have been slower, but more persistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.53,0)">Cross-border activity in the unsecured segments of the money markets paused and cross-border equity holdings declined sharply at the onset of the pandemic, posting a partial rebound in mid-2020.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Over the past year, financial flows have tended to be characterised by more liquid assets and securities with shorter maturities, pointing to a higher vulnerability to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">From January 2018 onwards the behaviour of the price-based indicator may have changed due to the transition in the money market component from EONIA to the €STR.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">OMT stands for Outright Monetary Transactions.. For a detailed description of the indicators and their input data, see Hoffmann, P., Kremer, M. and Zaharia, S.  , “Financial integration in Europe through the lens of composite indicators”, Working Paper Series, No 2319, ECB, September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.37,0)">The challenges of climate change This higher vulnerability occurs at a time when the financial system faces emerging risks related to climate change – a common shock faced by us all, albeit one with potentially asymmetric impacts on different sectors and regions of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">On aggregate, euro area bank exposures to the most carbon-intensive sectors, such as mining, are relatively contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">However, the concentration of carbon-intensive industries and activities can differ across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.33,0)">As we have seen in the pandemic, a common shock can have asymmetric impacts on countries which have a high concentration of certain sectors, such as tourism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Perhaps more importantly from a financial integration perspective, interconnectedness through supply chains matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Take manufacturing, which accounts for around 20% of banks’ loan portfolios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">While the reported direct emissions of these companies are comparatively lower, indirect exposures through the supply chain are more substantial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The physical risks of climate change have a clearer geographic angle and differ in their regional impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">These risks are also expected to increase in the coming decades, with some likely to be concentrated in particular geographical areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.62,0)">Floods are the most significant hazard in central and northern Europe, for example, while heatwaves, droughts and wildfires represent the greatest risks in southern Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Taken together, around 30% of the credit exposures of euro area banks are to businesses with high or increasing exposure to at least one source of physical risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Ultimately, the impact of climate change on financial stability depends on the degree of concentration of exposures, and what mitigation measures are in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.47,0)">Both fronts give cause for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.0,0)">Over 70% of identified physical risk exposures in the euro area are held by just 25 banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">There is also a notable concentration by country  , suggesting that physical risk could become a prominent source of asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.99,0)">Moreover, the physical collateral backing loans may itself be damaged by the event, exacerbating the risk to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.09,0)">Right panel: sample includes 45 countries for which the OECD provides quarterly GDP data from 1996 to 2019.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.76,0)">The chart shows the impact of large-scale natural disasters   when the share of insured losses is high   on the left, and low   on the right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.03,0)">The estimates are obtained using a panel regression model where the dependent variable is the year-on-year difference in the log of GDP and the explanatory variables include two dummies capturing large-scale disasters with a high and low share of insured losses respectively  , and country and quarterly fixed effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.41,0)">For the quarter including the date  of the disaster   and the three subsequent quarters, the y-axis measures the percentage point impact of the disaster on the year-on-year annual growth rate at the end of that quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In principle, one mitigating factor may be insurance, which in the past has helped support aggregate demand and hastened reconstruction following disasters, reducing the overall impact on economic activity  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.6,0)">In practice, however, there is already a substantial insurance “protection gap”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.28,0)">Only one-third of climate-related economic losses in the euro area are currently insured, a situation that could worsen with climate change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.38,0)">More frequent and severe natural disasters are likely to increase insurance claims, which may result in higher insurance premiums and potentially lead to lower insurance coverage, further widening the protection gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Green finance as a driver of financial integration A substantial amount of finance will be needed for there to be a smooth transition to meet the ambitious goals for a carbon neutral economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">But we also need a robust financial system capable of maintaining the flow of credit even if asymmetric shocks happen or if the transition is a little bumpy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">That brings me back once more to the importance of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Progress has certainly been made in stepping up sustainable finance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">Since 2015, the assets under management of environmental, social and governance    funds have almost tripled, the volume of outstanding green bonds has risen tenfold, and the amount of catastrophe bonds has almost doubled  .</span><span
