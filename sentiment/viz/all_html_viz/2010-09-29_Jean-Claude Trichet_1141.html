    <span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)"> Keeping the momentum for financial reform Keynote address by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the ECB, at the EUROFI Financial Forum 2010, Brussels, 29 September 2010 Ladies and Gentlemen, Introduction It is always a great pleasure for me to participate in the Eurofi events.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">They are excellent platforms for debate about financial services issues in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">This year’s forum takes place at a time of considerable progress on matters of financial regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">The establishment of the European System of Financial Supervision  , including the European Systemic Risk Board   and the three European Supervisory Authorities   is a milestone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">I would like to commend all of those who so actively contributed to this achievement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Europe at times advances in steps, but the new supervisory architecture is more than a step; it is a leap forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">We can today look back with satisfaction on what the EU has achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The work of the high-level group chaired by Jacques de Larosière proved to be seminal and has now born fruit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The EU has shown itself able to accomplish a comprehensive reform of its financial supervisory framework within a respectable timescale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The new framework is an important response to the financial crisis and it also takes us forward in fostering European financial integration, a key dimension of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The ESRB I will have the responsibility of chairing the ESRB, which has the mandate of mitigating EU-wide systemic risk through macro-prudential oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">At present, we hardly need to describe systemic risk in words: we can almost feel it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.96,0)">In all our economies, financial distress became so widespread that it impaired the functioning of the entire system to the point where economic growth and welfare suffered massively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.79,0)">This financial crisis is an overwhelming case of the materialisation of systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The ESRB will bring together risk assessments from various angles and pay particular attention to the ways in which risks can reinforce each other in highly detrimental ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It is therefore appropriate that the ESRB draws together the work of a broad range of EU institutions: central banks; our partners in the ESFS, including national supervisors; as well as the Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">The ESRB is complementary to these institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.78,0)">It does not replace any of their functions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">For the European Central Bank, which has been asked to provide specific support, I would like to stress that the ESRB is a body distinct and separate from the ECB, its Governing Council and General Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.63,0)">Importantly, the ESRB will not change in any way the mandate and the functioning of the ECB’s statutory role, and the same holds true for all central banks in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">I believe that a key strength of the new institution will lie in the diversity of its members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Each of them will bring different knowledge and expertise in the many influences on the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Indeed, fruitful interaction between ESRB members will be critical to ensure an all encompassing system of macro-prudential oversight of the EU’s financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.69,0)">But the task of the ESRB will be very challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">We launch this body at a time when important parts of the financial system are still under strain and far-reaching structural and regulatory changes are ongoing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The ESRB’s mandate is wide-ranging, covering any material systemic risk that threatens the stability of the EU’s financial system; the system’s contribution to the smooth functioning of the single market; and its sustainable contribution to economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The ESRB’s main tasks are threefold: to identify and prioritise systemic risks; to issue early warnings when significant systemic risks emerge; and to issue policy recommendations for remedial action in response to the risks it identifies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The ESRB will not focus on individual institutions, individual countries or individual macroeconomic issues – rather, the institution should have a strong horizontal focus, across countries, across sectors and across the boundaries between the financial sphere and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Interlinkages and spillovers should be key terms in its analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">To achieve these tasks, the ESRB will draw on information from many sources, including strong analytical input from its members; intelligence gathered from financial system participants; and the data necessary to understand the nature of the intricate interlinkages that define the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">ESRB analysis must be broad-based covering potentially any aspect of the EU’s financial system – markets, institutions and infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In particular, it should extend to those areas of activity that reside outside the usual regulatory scope, often referred to as the ‘shadow’ system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.02,0)">The ESRB does not have binding powers per se.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">It must convince through the quality of its work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">To achieve credibility, it must ensure that warnings are well-timed and that recommendations are specific and well-targeted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">To reinforce its actions, the ESRB has been given the responsibility of following up, including, where necessary, alerting the Council and the European Parliament, when it judges that compliance is less than satisfactory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Finally the new institution is embedded with a strong sense of public accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Strong links between the ESRB and the Parliament in particular – parliamentary hearings and annual reports, for example – will ensure that the ESRB is held to account in pursuing its oversight responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">I am very much looking forward to the ESRB’s formal launch next January and very close cooperation with all authorities concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The Basel III reform package Let me turn to “Basel III”, the reform package intended to put the global financial system on a sounder footing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In my view, this achievement will be a cornerstone of the new regulatory system and I would like to take a few moments to explain its evolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As the banking sector figured prominently in the crisis, unsurprisingly many of the G20’s action points are targeted on the sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The Basel Committee followed up on this call for action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Last December it published its proposals on strengthening capital and liquidity management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The consultation on the proposals triggered a wide response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Almost 300 comments were received from the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">The Committee also performed a macro-economic impact assessment of the stronger capital and liquidity requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">Taking account of all these elements, earlier this month the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision reached a final agreement on capital requirements and the transition to the new permanent regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.35,0)">Some commentators suggest that the agreements are too lenient while others argue that they are too tight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I do not share these views, and I would like to explain why I disagree with them and why I believe that the solution we have reached strikes the right balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.4,0)">Those who argue that the package is too lenient say that the regulators have been too soft on the banking sector, basically giving in to its intensive lobbying efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.74,0)">In this vein, they question the prudential soundness of some of the agreed measures, for example the treatment of minority interests or certain intangibles in the capital framework, or the treatment of certain types of bonds in the liquidity framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.59,0)">The implementation period for the measures is another argument advanced by the “too soft” camp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.3,0)">By contrast, those who argue that the agreements are too tight, point to the risk to banks’ lending activity and therefore to the recovery of the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The main point to keep in mind here is that despite the implementation costs, which are of a temporary nature, the new framework will benefit the global economy by enhancing financial stability through strong global standards and by contributing to avoid the massive economic and social costs of a major bust and deep recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">The so-called Long-term Economic Impact study – which like all such studies necessarily employs a range of simplifying assumptions – suggest that a 1% lowering of the yearly probability of a major financial crisis corresponds to an annual output gain of 0.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Of course, these figures need to taken with a pinch of salt, but they suggest that the order of magnitude is very significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">The same study suggests that, depending on the level of capital requirement, an increase of 1% in that capital requirement has a significant impact on this probability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">From a purely conceptual perspective, there is some validity in the argument that the value of certain of the assets that I mentioned earlier can be questioned in periods of extreme stress, which would suggest their deduction from regulatory capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,108.62,0)">But presenting this as an illustration of regulatory capture is wrong, because it ignores the fact that under the achieved consensus there is overall a very significant tightening of the prudential standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">There are two things that are particularly remarkable: first, we have been able to reach an agreement that is truly global.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It encompasses not only industrial economies but also emerging economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">As many as 27 countries are part of the GHOS, even more than in the G20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.06,0)">Second, the end results are tough standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">If we take into account the so-called capital conservation buffer, the required common equity has been increased from 2% to 7%, this is by a factor of 3.5.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">If I furthermore take into account the previous definition of capital, some institutions could present the level of common equity of only 1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For these institutions it is a multiplication by 7 which has been agreed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">This is a big step upward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">And overall, I consider that our agreement strikes the right balance between the objective of strengthening the resilience of the financial sector and the need to avoid unduly severe implications for national banking systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.41,0)">They are also global minimum standards and national regulators or supervisors can set tougher standards if they deem that appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The transition arrangements will allow banks to meet the new standards while not endangering the progressive consolidation of the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Let me mention a distinctly European note.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The new European supervisory system will not only strengthen oversight, it will also foster integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">By developing a single rule book, the European Supervisory Authorities will contribute to a level playing field in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">By monitoring and addressing financial stability risks, the European Systemic Risk Board might increase the confidence of market players to engage in cross-border financial activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">I also see a future role for the ESRB in relation to the Basel III measures that have a clear macro-prudential flavour, such as the countercyclical capital buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Issues on the G20 agenda of financial reform Let me turn to my last point, namely the G20 agenda as regards financial reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Financial reform is a long and arduous process, and my main message is that we have to keep the momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Allow me to single out a few key areas where it is essential to keep the momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">One is the work on reducing the moral hazard posed by systemically important financial institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.02,0)">The crisis revealed that these institutions might be major contributors to systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The G20 therefore agreed that they should be subject to regulatory and supervisory requirements, commensurate with the risks they pose to the financial system and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This is a very complex issue to tackle as there are many different aspects for which tools need to be developed to mitigate the risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">First, it is essential that tools are developed which increase the shock-absorbing capacity of systemically important financial institutions and lower their contribution to systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The introduction of additional measures, for example through capital surcharges and more intrusive supervision, is presently under debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">When looking at these additional prudential requirements, it is of the utmost importance that the impact of Basel III on the banking system and the broader economy is fully taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Second, it is important that tools are developed which ensure that authorities have the appropriate mechanisms in place to resolve the failure of a systemically important financial institution in an orderly and prompt manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.42,0)">We have to avoid recourse to taxpayers, as was too often the case in the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">There is no silver bullet to solve the problem of “too big to fail”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Instead, we need to have a combination of measures, covering the full spectrum from crisis prevention to crisis management to crisis resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Another area where much progress has been achieved, but where we must remain active, is the extension of oversight to institutions and markets not sufficiently covered by regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In this respect I hope that rapid progress will be made with the Commission’s legislative proposals on short selling and OTC derivatives, which address some important shortcomings of the current regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We also need more work on credit rating agencies and hedge funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.77,0)">Since December 2009, credit rating agencies in the EU have been subject to mandatory registration and oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">I very much welcome the progress made, and I am pleased that the work continues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">In the US also strong orientation has been adopted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We have to understand better the problem of adverse incentives arising from the over-reliance of investors and regulators on external ratings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.12,0)">The crisis revealed that even sophisticated investors and banks, supposed experts in assessing financial risks, too, often took the short-cut of outsourcing their risk-assessments to credit rating agencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The regulatory endorsement of external ratings, as in the capital framework, played an important role in this failing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">On alternative investment vehicles, the G20 has called for greater oversight and in a number of jurisdictions, including the EU and the US, regulatory measures are under discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">In this domain, too, I would call for a true level playing field at the global level and, in particular, a full convergence of the concept of oversight on both sides of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">As envisaged in the US and in Europe, aside from ensuring proper management of alternative investment vehicles, it is important to ensure appropriate and timely reporting to authorities on investment activities so as to control systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Concluding remarks Let me conclude with a few remarks on what I believe is essential to achieve effective reform of financial regulation – and why it is essential to keep the momentum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Effective financial reform needs perseverance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.81,0)">Achieving reform is complicated; there are many stakeholders, many legal issues and many international linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">Reform should result in policies that are sound, effective and convergent across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Thus dialogue and coordination at a global level are essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Effective financial reform also needs strong determination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Authorities avoided a collapse of the financial system only because they were able to take decisions with great rapidity and boldness that were not listed in any text books.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.51,0)">I will not insist on what the central banks did.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">It is very well-known.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Let me remind us that the executive branches and Parliaments decided to support the financial sector with a total amount of tax payer risk representing 27% of GDP – the same percentage on both sides of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">This gigantic support permitted to avoid a depression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.4,0)">It did not permit to avoid the deepest recession in the advanced economies since WWII.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">Our strong determination to make the financial system much more resilient, and much less fragile, is two-fold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">First, we must avoid in the future, as much as possible, the immense cost in terms of long-term economic growth of such a financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And second, if we had again, by misfortune, to cope with the same acute challenge, I am convinced that this time we would not obtain from our political democracies the same gigantic effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.12,0)">Then a depression would be unavoidable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">This is why my colleagues and I are calling for perseverance and for resolve in financial reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.19,0)">Our economic environment remains very demanding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.45,0)">This is no time for complacency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It is a time to remain alert, vigilant and inflexibly determined.</span>
