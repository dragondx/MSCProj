    <span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)"> The role of the ECB at the international level Speech by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, at the Annual Meeting of the Institute of International Finance, Inc.  , Prague, 23 September 2000 Introduction First of all, I should like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to address such a distinguished audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The Institute of International Finance   is the leading professional association of private sector financial institutions acting at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">As such, the IIF serves as a prominent forum for fostering a dialogue between the private financial community and policy-makers on key issues, such as the prevention of financial crises and the architecture of the international monetary system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">This explains why the European Central Bank   follows the IIF's initiatives with great interest and why, this evening, I am pleased to be able to share some thoughts with you.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Given the global nature of the IIF's activities and the concomitance of its Annual Meeting with the Annual Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank, I shall focus on the international dimension of the ECB's activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Let me start by recalling that, on 1 January 1999, the 11 Member States of what is now the euro area transferred their monetary sovereignty to a new supranational institution, the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.82,0)">Since then, the Governing Council of the ECB has been solely responsible for deciding the euro area's monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The Executive Board of the ECB has been implementing the Council's decisions mainly through the national central banks   of the countries which have adopted the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The ECB and the NCBs together form the "Eurosystem".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.73,0)">Accordingly, the Eurosystem is the central bank of the euro area, although it does not have a legal personality; this is only conferred upon the ECB and the NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">On 1 January 2001 the euro area will welcome a new Member State, Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Moreover, in five days - on 28 September 2000 - the Danish citizens will decide in a referendum whether their country shall also adopt the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">The Eurosystem enjoys full independence in pursuing its statutory mandate to ensure and maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.27,0)">"Independence", however, does not mean "isolation".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.85,0)">The Eurosystem, in other words, cannot perform its tasks without establishing appropriate external relationswith both market participants and other policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This evening I shall focus on the multilateral relations which the ECB - and more generally, the Eurosystem - maintains with otherpolicy-makersat the international   level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">These relations are promoted within organisations such as the IMF, the OECD and the BIS, as well as in fora such as the G7 and the G20.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I shall first provide a brief overview of the current relations of the ECB and the Eurosystem, both from an institutional angle and from the point of view of their rationale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Without wanting to be exhaustive, I shall then highlight a few challenges which the ECB - and, more generally, the international official community - may be confronted with.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In this context, I shall outline the ECB's assessment of a more specific issue, namely the issue of private sector involvement in the resolution of financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The ECB and the process of international co-operation Institutional framework The Treaty establishing the European Community   stipulates which European institutions are allowed either to speak or to act on behalf of the euro area at the international level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.04,0)">The euro area, like the Eurosystem, has no legal personality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.99,0)">This implies that the euro area cannot negotiate and conclude public international law agreements or become a member of international organisations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.78,0)">This also implies that the euro area has to be represented externally by Community institutions or bodies which have a legal personality; this means: 1) the Council of the Ministers of Finance and Economy of the EU  ; and 2) the ECB and, in accordance with an ECB decision, one or more NCBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">While the Treaty provides for interaction between the ECOFIN Council and the ECB in a number of cases, these entities have well-defined responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">This legal framework provides guidelines to give the euro area a voice at the international level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.18,0)">In particular, when the external representation of the euro area in the field of international co-operation involves the tasks entrusted to the Eurosystem, decisions are centralised in the hands of the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This facilitates the decision-making process with regard to external representation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">While NCBs may participate in international fora depending on their respective memberships  , the participation of the ECB in all relevant fora gives continuity and visibility to the external representation of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.98,0)">The roles the ECB plays in the international community differ depending on the Eurosystem tasks involved in international relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.97,0)">In particular, the ECB can play three different roles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">First, the ECB is a primary and autonomous counterpart whenever the Eurosystem's exclusive competencies - i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">monetary policy and related central banking tasks - are involved in international relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Second, with regard to issues related to the exchange rate of the euro, the ECB shares with the ECOFIN Council the responsibility for both consultations with third parties - for example at G7 level - and communication to the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.83,0)">However, the ECB is solely responsible for deciding foreign exchange operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Third, within the limits of the Eurosystem's field of competence, the ECB can advise other euro area policy-makers on international issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In specific circumstances the ECB may also act as a "catalyst for co-operation".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This may happen when the Eurosystem develops common views on issues which fall within the competence of other euro area authorities  , but in which the Eurosystem has a strong institutional interest, in accordance with its statute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This applies, for instance, to issues related to the stability of the global financial markets and the architecture of the international monetary system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">In dealing with these issues, the ECB may provide value added to the development of common euro area positions to be taken at the international level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Rationale for co-operation The relations of the ECB with other policy-makers at the international level involve a number of co-operation activities designed to increase the "joint welfare" resulting from their policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Generally speaking, "international co-operation" takes place, within the relevant organisations   and fora  , between the competent authorities of different countries for either a given policy   or a set of policies  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In this context, the term "country" should be understood to include monetary unions such as the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In principle, co-operation can include a wide spectrum of activities, namely: Consultation, which simply consists of a mutual exchange of information and views; Surveillance, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">the systematic monitoring and assessment, by an independent organisation, of the economic policies of its members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Within this context, the international community may also develop "standards" and "codes", which constitute a form of multilateral rule-making to be implemented on a voluntary basis; and Co-ordination, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">the agreement between separate policy-makers to take and implement joint decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">As I shall discuss, the Eurosystem is directly involved in most, although not all, of these activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The economic rationale for the ECB's involvement in international co-operation activities rests on the international externalities of domestic policies, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.84,0)">spillover effects which policies in one economy can produce on other economies via, for instance, interest rates, exchange rates and equity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.19,0)">The euro area, however, is a large and relatively closed economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The degree of trade openness of the euro area is much smaller than that of its constituent countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Measured by the average of exports and imports as a share of euro area GDP, the degree of openness is 16% in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">By contrast, prior to Monetary Union, the average export ratio of individual Member States stood at around 35% in 1997.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This helps to understand both why the euro area is not affected by spillover effects to the same extent as small open economies, and why the Eurosystem is in a position to pursue its primary objective - maintaining domestic price stability - in the most effective way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.3,0)">This does not mean, however, that the ECB neglects external economic developments when establishing the euro area monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.7,0)">On the contrary, the ECB takes these developments into due account as they may have an impact on domestic economic developments, and thus on price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The ECB's approach to external economic developments has three implications for the participation of the Eurosystem in the process of international co-operation in the area of macroeconomic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">First, a substantial component of the ECB's co-operation is the reciprocal exchange of information and views within international organisations and fora.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Regular consultation on external economic developments enhances the ECB's ability to analyse the outlook for price developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">By taking into account possible spillover effects from third countries' policy actions, consultation plays a part in reducing the likelihood of misinterpreting the impact of external developments on domestic variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.76,0)">Given its voluntary nature, consultation does not impinge on the ECB's independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Second, consultation is supplemented by international surveillance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In this case, a third and independent party, such as the IMF or OECD, regularly monitors and assesses the economic policies of its members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.43,0)">In this regard, whenever the euro area monetary policy is under surveillance, the ECB is solely responsible for interaction with the IMF and OECD.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">International surveillance adds to the ECB's transparency as both the IMF and the OECD make their assessments of euro area economic policies available to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In the context of surveillance, the international community is also developing common understandings on a number of "rules of the game" to be implemented in each individual country on a voluntary basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">An example is given by the IMF Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The selection of best practices and rules enhances competition and transparency among policy-makers, thus making the idea of good public governance a central component of international co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Third, consultation and surveillance are the forms of international co-operation which are relevant to the ECB in the area of macroeconomic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,86.21,0)">Any form of ex ante international co-ordination of monetary policy with other macroeconomic policies could easily be incompatible with the Eurosystem's mandate and independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.12,0)">Attempts to co-ordinate ex ante would not only blur the specific responsibilities of individual policy-makers, but also reduce their accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">In determining its monetary policy stance, the ECB should and does take into account all relevant information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.44,0)">It cannot let its policy be determined solely by the current and future course of other policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.23,0)">This could easily compromise the maintenance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.07,0)">The inappropriateness of ex ante policy co-ordination also applies to the more specific option of exchange rate co-ordination between large economic areas, for instance by setting ranges for the fluctuation of the major currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In this regard, I should like to take the opportunity to reaffirm that the ECB does not pursue any exchange rate target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Our objective is to maintain stable prices in the euro area and not a specific level of the euro's exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Last but not least, the Eurosystem takes part in the process of international co-operation not only in its role as a "primary player" - i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">when euro area monetary and exchange rate policies are involved - but also in its roles as advisor to other euro area authorities on international issues and "catalyst for co-operation".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">In this case, international co-operation is mainly designed to ensure global financial stability and enhance the architecture of the international monetary system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The economic rationale for this kind of co-operation can be summarised as follows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.53,0)">First, financial instability can materialise even with sound macroeconomic policies, as a result of factors such as inadequate supervision in emerging market economies and so-called "contagion", i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.63,0)">the international transmission of instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Second, a world divided into sovereign states has inevitably moved more rapidly towards full capital mobility than towards common rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.4,0)">The asymmetry between the free movement of capital, which takes place on a global scale, and policy-making, which remains mainly in the national domain, can have implications for financial stability and calls for enhanced international co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The challenges ahead Let me now turn to the challenges ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I shall distinguish between challenges related to the institutional framework for international co-operation and challenges pertaining to the specific contents of international co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Institutional challenges Over the past two years, the representation of the euro area in international organisations and fora has been decided in accordance with the aforementioned guidelines laid down in the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.87,0)">These guidelines and decisions, however, have no direct legal bearing on the statutes and/or internal rules governing international organisations and fora.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">This implies a need for the gradual adaptation of the traditional institutional framework for international relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">That framework was not tailored to the involvement of monetary unions as such, nor to the advent of the Eurosystem - and, more generally, the euro area - as a new actor in international relations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Until now, this process of adaptation has been conducted to a large extent on the basis of ad hoc solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">In the longer run, however, a more fundamental approach may be needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">A first challenge arises from the fact that the international intergovernmental organisations - the IMF and the OECD - were created at a time when only national states were responsible for domestic policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.48,0)">As a result, only individual countries - and not the ECB and other representatives of the euro area as such - are members of the IMF and the OECD, even if these organisations deal, among other things, with the euro area monetary and exchange rate policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Both the IMF and the OECD have adjusted their internal rules to reflect the new context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">In particular, the Executive Board of the IMF has granted permanent observer status to the ECB, and the OECD has allowed the ECB to participate in the work of its relevant committees and working groups as a separate member of the European Community delegation alongside the Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.04,0)">A second challenge is the definition of an adequate representation of the euro area in those international fora where both ministers and central bank governors are represented  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.6,0)">Here the problem raised by the creation of the euro area was its capability to speak - if and when appropriate - "with one voice".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.04,0)">Specific arrangements between the euro area and its counterparts in the various fora have dealt with this problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">These arrangements, however, may still call for some improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.35,0)">For instance, it is true that issues such as the architecture of the international monetary system fall primarily under the competence of individual euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">The ECOFIN Council, however, needs to gain an increasingly higher profile when these issues are discussed in the competent fora  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">This would strengthen the European stance and simplify the process for decision-making at the international level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">In this respect, the Eurosystem may provide - as I will discuss afterwards - significant value added to euro area governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">More generally speaking, the ECB would welcome any initiative of euro area governments designed to enhance - in compliance with the respective competencies of the ECOFIN Council and the Eurosystem - the credibility and clout of the euro area in the international community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The content of co-operation: the ECB's assessment of "private sector involvement" The other major challenge for the ECB and the Eurosystem in the years to come will be to become more directly involved in the process of international co-operation beyond the area of macroeconomic co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">This relates, in particular, to current work being done to strengthen the international financial architecture, which is close to the area of traditional competence and expertise of the central banking community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">The Eurosystem supports this process for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">First, because the achievement of its primary objective of safeguarding price stability in the euro area would be facilitated by a safer and more resilient international financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Second, because the statute of the Eurosystem establishes that the Eurosystem shall contribute to the smooth conduct of policies relating to the stability of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">A wide range of topics could be discussed here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">However, the interest that the IIF has shown in the recent past in the issue of "private sector involvement" leads me to focus on the ECB's assessment of ongoing discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Owing to changes in the magnitude and composition of capital flows, the private sector is playing an increasingly important role in the financing of emerging market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">According to recent IIF estimates, in the 1990s 85% of total net inflows of capital to the major borrowing countries came from the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Such inflows averaged USD 170 billion per annum, compared with USD 35 billion per annum in the 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.13,0)">By contrast, net official flows averaged USD 30 billion per annum throughout the 1990s and reached only USD 5 billion in 1999, their lowest level for over 20 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Despite these developments, however, in times of financial distress the role of the official sector remains crucial in providing financial assistance to emerging market economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It is true that informal arrangements are in force in order to facilitate negotiations with the main creditors of the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The so-called "London Club" has become a kind of permanent institution, like the Paris Club for obligations vis-à-vis official creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.71,0)">However, the development of new instruments for lending to emerging market economies and the increasing diversification of the creditor base, while facilitating the financing of the countries concerned, render negotiations between debtor countries and their private sector creditors more difficult in the event of a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This explains why, so far, only ad hoc measures have been developed in order to involve private sector creditors - on a case-by-case basis - in the resolution of financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In addition to enhanced efforts to improve the communication channels between debtor countries and their creditors, which would also enhance crisis prevention, the ECB would support a move to strengthen the existing framework for the management of financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Three fundamental principles may be helpful to this aim.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.89,0)">First, the framework should rely more on rules and less on discretion than was the case in the second half of the 1990s A case-by-case approach, lacking clear "rules of the game" on the respective roles of private and official sectors in times of distress, runs the risk of creating the perception that official resources would provide a "safety net" if need be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.22,0)">Such a perception is likely to distort debt management on the borrowers' side and risk assessment on the creditors' side, thus engendering problems of moral hazard on both sides.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.77,0)">Second, the IMF cannot - owing to its limited resources which do not match private capital outflows - and should not - owing to moral hazard problems mentioned above - act as an international lender of last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">IMF financial assistancecan neither be unlimited nor cover all the financing needs of a country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The IMF should rather play a catalytic role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">IMF conditionality in the form of adjustment programmes should, in conjunction with IMF financing, be instrumental in improving the external position of member countries and quickly restoring market confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">Actual ceilings on access to IMF financing facilities should also be established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Third, as a logical consequence of limited official financing, the private sector should be involved in the resolution of financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.71,0)">It is a matter of fact that a country running into financial difficulties will need to involve its creditors in one way or another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In this context, the crucial question is how "orderly" such an involvement should be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">In their efforts to secure adequate private sector involvement,debtorcountries should try to reach market-based and co-operative solutions with all classes of creditors, respecting comparable treatment among and within different classes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">We are convinced that a strengthened framework based on these principles would create the right expectations in both the private sector and the official sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">It would also allow for sufficient flexibility to address specific cases in the course of a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Conclusions I shall bring this talk to a close by drawing a few basic conclusions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">In principle, the introduction of the euro should simplify international co-operation by reducing the number of key players in the international arena.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In this new streamlined international setting, the euro area can be expected to play a greater role and to gain a higher profile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">In this respect, the ECB is already a potentially influential participant in the process of international co-operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">At the same time, the ECB is a new player in this process, and its role will therefore evolve over time.</span>
