    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)"> Communication, expectations and monetary policy Intervention by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, at the ECB policy panel of the Annual Congress of the European Economic Association, Manchester, 27 August 2019 Introduction Ladies and Gentlemen, Every year, the ECB organises a policy panel at the Annual Congress of the European Economic Association.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The intention of these panels is to combine the results of research and the views of policy makers to advance our thinking on a topic of great policy relevance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">This year, it has been straightforward to decide on such a topic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Communication and expectations are central to the conduct of monetary policy, and there is a substantial body of research that allows us to have an informed discussion on the topic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">It is therefore a great pleasure for me to speak at this year’s policy panel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Central banks communicate with many different groups of economic actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me focus my remarks on two such groups, both of which are essential to the conduct of monetary policy, namely participants in financial markets on the one hand, and the general public on the other hand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.85,0)">The central role of financial market expectations in the conduct of monetary policy There is a tight two-way relationship between central banks and financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Extensive research has dealt with the flow of information from central banks to financial markets, and has shown that central bank communication exerts strong effects on financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">For instance, as central banks have become transparent about their objectives and their reaction functions, the inflation expectations that are priced into financial assets have become better anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">They have become less volatile and broadly aligned with the central banks’ inflation aims.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Beyond this, markets also react strongly to the communication of the central bank’s assessment of the current conjunctural situation and the economic outlook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">At the same time, the influence also goes in the other direction: financial markets send signals to the central bank, which constitute a central input to decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It is important for us to get the market view about where the economy stands, and where it is heading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">This helps us cross-checking our own views, and it provides us with a benchmark against which we can communicate our own assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">For instance, our projections are based on market expectations about the future path of short-term interest rates, oil and non-oil commodity prices and stock market prices – effectively, we are therefore telling the markets where, in our view, the economy is heading if their expectations were to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">To put it in other words, central bank communication has to be two-way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The central bank talks and listens to financial markets at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">There are two points in this relationship which I want to highlight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.34,0)">First, by influencing asset prices and expectations of financial market participants, the central bank affects the very signals which it wants to use as input to its policy making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This has become known as the “echo chamber effect”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As Hyun Shin from the BIS has put it, “the louder the central bank talks, the more likely it is to hear its own echo.”  This is particularly prominent in times when the central bank gives strong forward guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">ECB research has shown that in such circumstances, market expectations become “cemented”, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.54,0)">they do no longer respond to news about the macro economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is something we need to keep in mind when designing our communication strategy and when reading the signals from financial markets – the more forward guidance we give, the less informative are market signals for gauging the state and the expected evolution of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">A second point is that even if central bank transparency and communication has helped anchoring market-based inflation expectations, they do remain rather volatile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The volatility itself is a signal that is useful for us to understand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.22,0)">However, even if markets are volatile, central bank policy cannot be volatile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Hence, we need to look through some of this volatility to get a feeling for the underlying pricing that would result in the absence of short-term market moves that are likely to revert quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.9,0)">The echo chamber effect and the inherent noisiness of market signals are reasons why we need to take the expectations that are priced in financial markets with a pinch of salt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">This means that we need to also rely on other sources of information to ensure that we conduct a robust monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The incoming macroeconomic data are one such source.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.75,0)">As we keep stressing, our monetary policy is data dependent, not market dependent: indications from market expectations cannot replace our policy judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Another way of robustifying our analysis is to look for expectations beyond those expressed in financial market prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The importance of communication with the general public This brings me to the second group of actors I want to mention, the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Central bank communication with the general public has only more recently gained the attention of academic research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Also here, we need to think of the interaction as a two-way street.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">On the one hand, central banks have a lot to learn from consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For instance, consumers form inflation expectations that can tell us to what extent the central bank’s inflation aim is perceived to be credible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.11,0)">Variations in consumer inflation expectations are also an indicator that central banks monitor, because these affect household decision-making and do therefore shape economic outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.78,0)">While we have ample data available on expectations formed in financial markets, we know much less about those of consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">To bridge this gap, we have just recently started to develop a new consumer expectations survey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This project is still in its early stages  , but it will provide us with a tool to collect information at regular intervals on household expectations and decisions, covering a broad range of topics including household income and finances, consumption, inflation, labour and housing markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This will allow deepening our understanding of consumer behaviour in the euro area and give us up-to-date information on expectations that can feed into our policy analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">On the other hand, central banks do not only want to learn from the general public, they also actively reach out to it, making this a two-way interaction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">They do so for several reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">First, to manage expectations about economic outcomes – inflation expectations, but also expectations about financial stability and the safety of individual banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Second, independent central banks need to make sure they are accountable to the public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">For both objectives, first-order importance should be given to making sure the general public understands the mandate of the central bank, and trusts its commitment and ability to deliver on its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">There is ample evidence that this matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">ECB research finds that general trust in the ECB has an impact on consumers’ inflation expectations, in two ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">First, it lowers their uncertainty about future price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.95,0)">Second, those who trust are less likely to have inflation expectations that are far from the ECB’s inflation objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">In other words, trust in the ECB helps anchoring inflation expectations around the ECB’s inflation objective, as agents are more likely to view deviations of inflation from the target as temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">And it matters how the central bank drafts its communications – research has shown that relatively simple, but targeted messages, are particularly effective in shaping consumers’ inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">So it is important to increase awareness about the central bank mandate and to enhance trust in the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,144.07,0)">Just as an aside - the ECB’s task here is particularly challenging, as we need to communicate in 24 different languages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">In any case, we have stepped up our efforts along these lines in several dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Let me highlight three of them: First, we have developed educational material about the ECB and its policies that is made available on our website – for the young generation in particular, but also more generally: there are educational games and videos, and we have published a large number of “explainers” where we give answers to frequently asked questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Just to give one example – with our Euro@20 game, we reached 1.6million people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Second, we are now much more present in the social media.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This is an important channel whereby central banks can reach out a relatively broader audience directly, without intermediaries, and interact with the public, for instance through our Q&A sessions on Twitter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Third, we are also working to make our regular policy publications more accessible to the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Our most recent Financial Stability Review, with a streamlined structure and clear focus on core messages, is presented on the ECB’s website in a way that makes the content more easily understood, for instance by using visuals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Our efforts are already bearing fruit – with a significant increase in its readership.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude by reiterating the central role of expectations in the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">We are well aware that our communication influences the very expectations that we want to use as input into our decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We do therefore need to ensure that we base our decisions on a multitude of information, covering not only financial markets and experts, but also the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">At the ECB, we are enhancing our toolkit for the communication with the general public in two ways – both by collecting more information about consumers, and by targeting some of our communication efforts more directly at the general public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">I am confident that this investment will pay off and help us achieving three objectives at the same time – being a trusted institution, being accountable to the public, and maintaining price stability.</span><span
