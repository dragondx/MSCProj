    <h3> Speaker: Willem F. Duisenberg </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)"> Speech at the Swiss Banking Congress in Zurich by the President of the European Central Bank, Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg on 10 September 1999 Ladies and gentlemen, I was only too pleased to accept your invitation to this place of price stability between Lake Constance and the Defourspitze, to report to you on the first experiences with the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">No other country in Europe can rival the success of Switzerland in combating inflation, and this is something of which you can be very proud.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">With the introduction of the single currency in Europe, European integration has scaled new heights.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Since the beginning of this year, the Governing Council of the ECB has been responsible for the stability of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Monetary Union means that for the whole of the euro area there is only one single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">The aim of this policy is to achieve price stability in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.13,0)">This means that there can no longer be a monetary policy designed to meet the needs of individual Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Therefore, it will be more important than ever for individual Member States to push on determinedly with fiscal consolidation and to carry out structural reforms with the aim of enhancing the flexibility of the commodity and employment markets and improving the incentives for the creation and the taking-up of employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.88,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB determines the single monetary policy centrally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.12,0)">The Governing Council consists of the Executive Board of the ECB and the governors of the central banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.43,0)">Monetary policy decisions are implemented by the Eurosystem, which comprises the ECB and the national central banks of the 11 participating EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The national central banks are, above all, entrusted with the decentralised implementation of the single monetary policy and the relevant activities in their countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">First, I should like to say that the launch and the first few months of the common currency have, in our view, gone well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The initial experiences with the euro and the single monetary policy have proved to be both positive and encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">We have currently achieved price stability and the prospects look good for this to remain the case in the years to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB has become a truly supranational body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">The members of the Governing Council clearly see themselves as committed to this joint cause.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">They take the whole euro area into consideration when discussing and taking decisions on monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The efforts made prior to and at the time of the changeover weekend at the beginning of this year are already part of history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.7,0)">Since the beginning of this year the euro has been quoted on the international financial markets and used for cashless payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Although the euro will only become available in the tangible form of banknotes and coins in over two years' time, there is already a feeling that the euro is accepted by the majority of the population and that the benefits of the euro are appreciated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">The euro, as you in Switzerland are particularly well placed to observe, is playing an increasingly important role not only within the euro area, but also beyond it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Monetary policy with a view to price stability European Economic and Monetary Union is a great opportunity to achieve the objective of sustained and widespread price stability in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Monetary stability is the best contribution that monetary policy can make to lasting economic and employment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Stable prices promote the efficient allocation of scarce resources and also help to guide expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">For these sound reasons, the Treaty establishing the European Community specifies the maintenance of price stability as the primary objective of the European System of Central Banks  , and therefore of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The Governing Council of the ECB does its utmost to fulfil this function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.21,0)">In this respect, it endeavours to communicate its monetary policy to the public in a comprehensible manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">In particular, the Governing Council of the ECB has published a quantitative definition of its primary objective of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This helps provide economic agents with clear guidance on expectations of future price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The publication of this definition also provides the public and the European Parliament with clear criteria for assessing the success of the single monetary policy, thereby rendering the Eurosystem and its policy both transparent and accountable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The Eurosystem defines price stability as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2% to be maintained over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.31,0)">The wording "below 2%" clearly delineates the upper boundary for the measured rate of inflation that is consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.28,0)">At the same time, in this context, the use of the word "increase" implies that deflation - i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.87,0)">a prolonged decline in the price level - is not consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">The price stability objective must be achieved both in the medium term and the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">On the one hand, this objective has been set in order to take into account the variable and somewhat unpredictable time lags affecting monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.55,0)">On the other, it is a reflection of the possible emergence of short-term volatility in prices resulting from non-monetary shocks that cannot be controlled by monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Stability-oriented monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem The monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem is geared towards price stability within the euro area and can basically be described as a two-pillar strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The first pillar assigns a prominent role to money as defined by the broad monetary aggregate M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.21,0)">There is wide consensus that medium-term inflation is actually a monetary phenomenon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Therefore, the money supply provides a natural "nominal anchor" for a monetary policy aiming at the safeguarding of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">To emphasise the prominent role assigned to money, the Governing Council of the ECB has announced a quantitative reference value for monetary growth in terms of the broad definition of M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The second pillar of the monetary policy strategy is founded on a broadly based assessment of the outlook for price developments in the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This assessment is made using a wide range of indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In particular, those variables which may provide information on future price developments are thoroughly analysed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">These analyses should not only provide information on the risks for price developments, but should also help to determine the cause of unexpected changes in important economic variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In view of this policy stance and the published definition of price stability, the monetary policy strategy of the Eurosystem bears some resemblance to that of the Swiss National Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Allow me to quote the President of the Swiss National Bank, who outlined the strategy of the Swiss National Bank as follows: "We try to meet the price stability objective by following developments in the monetary aggregates, but also, at the same time, taking into account other indicators."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">However, the motives for developing these respective strategies were different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.61,0)">Whilst in Switzerland disturbances affecting, in particular, the demand for central bank money "for reasons still unknown" have increased in recent years, the ECB faces additional uncertainties at the beginning of Monetary Union in terms of the effects of the shift of regime to a single monetary policy in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.41,0)">It is difficult to assess whether conventional and reliable macroeconomic relationships are changing as a result of the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.9,0)">In view of these uncertainties, but also in general, it is unwise to rely on a few indicators or only one when making monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Indeed, to date our studies have revealed that the M3 monetary aggregate shows clear signs of stability and healthy indicator properties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">This provides a sound basis for the prominent role given to the M3 monetary aggregate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Monetary policy instruments and the operational framework of the Eurosystem The operational framework of the Eurosystem has proved to be an effective instrument for steering money market interest rates and for limiting fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.53,0)">The Eurosystem controls money market interest rates by means of either the provision or withdrawal of liquidity in the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Open market operations play an important role in the context of monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The weekly main refinancing operations give an indication of the Eurosystem's monetary policy and provide the largest share of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Longer-term refinancing operations provide the banking system with longer-term liquidity  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The system of   minimum reserves has contributed towards smoothing out daily liquidity fluctuations in the money market, whilst the "standing facilities" effectively limit fluctuations in the money market interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The efficiency of this set of instruments can be demonstrated by the fact that the Eurosystem has been able to manage to date without having recourse to any fine-tuning operations in the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">In fact, developments in short-term money market interest rates have thus far been exceptionally stable and money market rates have been relatively close to the interest rates at which the ECB has provided liquidity through its weekly main refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This is a notable success, as is the extremely rapid integration of the money markets in the euro area, in which, since January, temporary interest rate differentials have been rapidly eliminated during the day through arbitrage by active market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Initial monetary policy decisions Conditions at the start of the introduction of the euro were favourable, given a rate of inflation of below 2%   and moderate monetary growth rates in the two years leading up to the beginning of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.6,0)">However, the outlook in the euro area became increasingly gloomy in the second half of 1998 as a result of the crises in Asia and in Russia, thereby causing inflationary pressure to weaken further.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.44,0)">The central banks of the participating countries reacted by reducing short-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.05,0)">This caused the average interest rate level in those countries of the future euro area to be lowered considerably before the beginning of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The close co-operation which had always existed between the European central banks was increasingly stepped up in the final months of 1998 between those countries participating in Stage Three of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.57,0)">The co-ordinated reduction of central bank rates in December 1998 to 3% made it perfectly clear that, de facto, Monetary Union had already begun before the start of Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.61,0)">Looking at economic developments, in the first few months of this year there have been an increasing number of indications that the negative effects of the crises in Asia and Russia on growth and employment in the euro area could be more serious than was first expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.44,0)">With the apparent slowdown in economic growth in the euro area, the risks that the 2% threshold for the tolerable rate of inflation would be exceeded in the foreseeable future evaporated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This forecast was also reflected in the revisions to the inflation forecasts of international organisations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.0,0)">At the beginning of April 1999, the Governing Council of the ECB therefore decided to reduce the interest rates on the main refinancing operations by 50 basis points to 2.5%, as well as the rates on the standing facilities, to 1.5% and 3.5% respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The M3 monetary aggregate did expand such that it was slightly above the reference value at the beginning of 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.19,0)">However, it was not clear, at that point in time, whether this sharp increase at the beginning of the year was a one-off effect in connection with the launch of the single currency, and thus quickly fall again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In view of these uncertainties, the Governing Council of the ECB saw nothing in the development of M3 in the spring of this year to prevent it from reducing the interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Current assessment of the monetary, financial and economic situation Please allow me to explain briefly how the Governing Council of the ECB currently views the monetary, financial and economic situation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.69,0)">Since the beginning of the year, the annual inflation rate for the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices has stood at around 1% in the euro area as a whole, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">within our definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Whilst the rate of price increases in food products has been falling since the beginning of the year, energy prices have increased strongly as result of the sharp increase in oil prices over the last few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Overall the upward pressure turned out to be moderate, and perhaps more moderate than expected, which is a reflection of the increased competition in the service sector and the success of deregulation in some markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">However, since production costs could also increase in time as a result of the increase in energy prices, the increase in oil prices contributes to certain risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">However, this should not lead to sustained higher inflation rates, as long as the unions do not use the higher energy prices as grounds to demand additional wage increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The monetary aggregate M3 rose in July by 5.6% compared with 5.3% in June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.32,0)">The money supply figures have recently been revised upwards and we still need to examine the factors responsible for these revisions carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.42,0)">Measured by the moving average over the last three months, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.2,0)">May, June, and July, M3 growth has moved further away from the reference value of 4.5% announced by the Governing Council of the ECB at the beginning of this year to 5.4%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This increase is largely attributable to the low opportunity costs of holding money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">However, the gradual improvement in the economic outlook has probably also played a role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Similarly, the development in lending to the private sector is not restrictive at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.49,0)">Annualised growth rates of just over 10% do not, in any case, indicate that the conditions for lending are currently unfavourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">As previously explained, the money supply development of M3 plays a prominent role in our strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.81,0)">However, short-term fluctuations in the money supply should be viewed cautiously, not least because of the uncertainties associated with the brief existence of Monetary Union and the recent statistical revisions to the money supply figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">However, the most recent figures suggest increased growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">At the same time, the prospects for an economic recovery in Europe starting this year and continuing into next year have clearly improved in the meantime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In addition to encouraging trends in the global economy, the stabilisation of output growth in the euro area has contributed significantly to this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">However, the most recent industry and consumer surveys also give positive indications with regard to economic activity in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Therefore, it is likely that economic activity will accelerate in the second half of 1999 and the year 2000.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">When assessing the risks for price stability, the ECB does also monitor the external value of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">The weakening of the effective exchange rate of the euro, which remained at around 8% between the start of the year and early September, lent itself to an increase in import prices denominated in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Taking into account all available information, the outlook for the preservation of price stability remains favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">However, recently inflationary risks have increased slightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In the coming months it will therefore be necessary to monitor developments in the monetary aggregates and credit aggregates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In addition, the short-term effects of the increase in oil prices and exchange rate developments on consumer prices need to be taken into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The latter factors should not affect the outlook for price stability as long as wage increases remain moderate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The wage round for the year 2000 will, however, play an important role in future price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.26,0)">On the basis of this current assessment of the monetary, financial and economic situation, the Governing Council of the ECB left the central bank interest rates unchanged at yesterday's meeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">Economic policy arena: fiscal policy and the employment markets The success of Monetary Union and the future of Europe will also depend on fiscal and structural policies in the Member States significantly improving the structural conditions for further economic development and, in particular, employment developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.36,0)">As is evident from the waning consolidation efforts following the beginning of Monetary Union and the continuing high level of unemployment, in general, the initial experiences in this area were rather disappointing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.38,0)">Most Member States are currently still very far from meeting the medium-term requirement for a balanced budget laid down in the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.27,0)">The measures currently planned are, for the most part, insufficient to achieve a sustained reduction in the long-term structural deficits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.74,0)">This problem is becoming particularly obvious given the current low interest rates in the euro area, which have, in themselves, tended to increase the scope for fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In view of the relatively positive economic outlook for the euro area, fiscal policy should be taking advantage of this opportunity to make cuts in expenditure in order to achieve a more sound fiscal policy in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.9,0)">The high level of unemployment in Europe is primarily of a structural nature, which is evident when a comparison is made with the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.43,0)">Whilst in the United States, over the last twenty years, unemployment has declined significantly during the economic cycles as a result of a successful deflationary and stability policy introduced by the Federal Reserve, unemployment in Europe has increased further in the same period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.85,0)">Since the beginning of the year, the rate of unemployment has stabilised at around 10% in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Those Member States with more flexible employment markets and more restrained wage bargaining generally have much higher levels of employment than the average in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">It is still hoped that the current upturn will not be slowed down by excessive demands for higher wages and will be used to make decisive structural policy reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Flexibility in the employment and commodity markets would therefore appear to be urgently needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">As you know, at the summit in Cologne the European Council called for an Employment Pact to be created with the aim of achieving a sustained reduction in unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The Pact underlines the need for the implementation of structural reforms in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">It is hoped that the Pact will achieve this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Together with the national fiscal policy-makers, the unions and the European Commission, the Eurosystem will also take part in the macroeconomic dialogue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">We shall use this dialogue to make it absolutely clear to the other parties that structural unemployment cannot be reduced without decisive reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.82,0)">Short-term activism intended to stimulate employment cannot solve the structural elements of the problem and the Eurosystem will insist that all measures envisaged by other parties are consistent with the need to preserve price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The international role of the euro Finally, I should like to talk in more detail about the international role of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The euro is the currency of an economic area consisting of almost 300 million inhabitants, which represents around one-sixth of the world's gross domestic product.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Behind the US dollar and ahead of the Japanese yen, the euro is the second most used currency at the international level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This is a reflection of the former significance of the national currencies which the euro replaced, as well as the important role that the euro area plays in the global economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The ability of the Eurosystem to preserve price stability has not been hampered by the start of the internationalisation of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Initial experiences have shown that the development of the euro as an international currency will be determined, above all, by the international financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In this context, the use of the euro in the private economic sector as an investment and issuing currency and as a means of payment is of great importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The international interest in the euro is evident, for example, from international new issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">According to information from the Bank for International Settlements, the volume of new issues in euro   almost doubled in the first half of 1999 compared with same period last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.99,0)">By contrast, the increase in new issues in US dollars was around 10% weaker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.06,0)">New issues in the Japanese yen and the Swiss franc either stagnated or even declined somewhat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">With regard to the role of the exchange rates between the euro and other important currencies outside of the EU, in particular the US dollar, the Eurosystem made an unambiguous choice when shaping its monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.9,0)">This strategy clearly excludes any explicit or implicit targets or target zones for the euro exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.11,0)">The pursuit of an exchange rate target could easily jeopardise the preservation of the price stability objective and therefore hamper real economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.91,0)">It should also be noted that exchange rate fluctuations are often caused by structural or fiscal policy, as well as divergent economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.8,0)">Monetary policy would be significantly challenged and its credibility put at risk, if such exchange rate fluctuations had to be contained by monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.47,0)">The absence of an exchange rate target does not mean that the ECB views the exchange rate of the euro as irrelevant or does not take it into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">On the contrary, the exchange rate is monitored and analysed as a potentially important monetary policy indicator.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The success of the euro in its relatively early stage of life has led, in many places outside the EU, to suggestions that domestic monetary policy should be more closely linked to that of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Suggestions range from pegging the exchange rate to the euro to the introduction of the euro as a parallel currency or even as a replacement currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In principle, the ECB maintains a totally neutral position with regard to such developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We will neither endeavour to strengthen the international role of the euro nor to prevent such developments from taking place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">In this respect, I should like to emphasise that when formulating monetary policy the Governing Council of the ECB is bound by the mandate to ensure price stability in the euro area set out in the Maastricht Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">This means that developments in neighbouring European countries are taken into account to the extent that the outlook for these countries influences price developments in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.82,0)">However, the ECB cannot and may not assume any obligations with regard to monetary or general economic policies in other countries, irrespective of the role the euro plays in those countries or of the size of the economies concerned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">I should like to point out that the Maastricht Treaty envisages a clear and transparent procedure, which lays down the conditions for countries wishing to join the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.84,0)">There are three stages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The basic prerequisite is that the country is a member of the EU, which is linked to specific criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In addition, the country concerned is expected to join the Exchange Rate Mechanism II, for which it must similarly fulfil certain economic criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">Finally, the convergence criteria must be
