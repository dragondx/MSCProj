    <h3> Speaker: Peter Praet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)"> Heterogeneity in a monetary union: What have we learned?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Speech by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, 15 June 2012 It is a great pleasure to be speaking here today at what has, over the years, become a prime opportunity for the European Central Bank to exchange views with ECB watchers on the challenges faced by monetary policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.31,0)">My remarks today   will focus on the question of how imbalances in terms of competitiveness and private and public sector debt have gradually led to a worrying degree of heterogeneity in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">I will also highlight the effects of the ECB’s liquidity-providing operations, arguing that these contribute to more homogeneous financial conditions across the euro area and allow a smoother adjustment process during the transitional period needed in order to reabsorb accumulated imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I will, however, also argue that these operations can only be regarded as temporary support, as the underlying structural problems and weaknesses require a truly structural response completing the overall architecture of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.29,0)">When the euro was first introduced, many critics claimed that EMU would not work because euro area countries’ business cycles and economic structures were not sufficiently similar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But does economic integration really need to imply economic uniformity?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.26,0)">I do not think so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This can clearly be seen in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.98,0)">Regional economies are hit by different economic shocks and perform differently owing to their differing economic structures, even over extended periods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">At the same time, institutional safeguards are required in order to ensure that heterogeneous developments do not become self-reinforcing and pose a threat to overall macroeconomic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.51,0)">Here in the euro area, we have to acknowledge that economic conditions have, today, become increasingly heterogeneous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But let me state very clearly up front that this does not imply that a common currency cannot succeed in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">To my mind, this means that we need to address the institutional shortcomings and weaknesses of EMU in order to allow the euro area to cope with heterogeneous economic developments and large asymmetric shocks, as is the case in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.22,0)">There, too, economic and monetary union did not occur overnight; it was a long process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Otmar Issing   argued, more than a decade ago, that “one size must fit all”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Provided that institutions adapt, EMU should be beneficial for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.3,0)">Since the introduction of the euro, many of us have been aware of institutional deficiencies, both in terms of the prevention of imbalances and as regards the management of such imbalances in the event of a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.44,0)">The crisis is now forcing us to address these deficiencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Allow me, in the remainder of my remarks, to look at how and why imbalances arose in the euro area and how the ECB’s monetary policy responded to them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.76,0)">How and why did imbalances arise in the euro area?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Financial uniformity with increasing imbalances The situation prior to the financial crisis is best described as one in which euro area countries achieved a very high degree of convergence in terms of financial conditions, while at the same time large macroeconomic and financial imbalances were gradually accumulating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">With the advent of the euro, there was significant convergence in terms of the financial conditions in the various euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">Euro area banks were able to trade with one another in a unified money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">Consequently, there was also significant convergence in terms of the interest rates that banks charged households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Indeed, these are necessary conditions for a single monetary policy that affects all economic agents in the same way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">However, the sovereign bonds of the various euro area countries were also priced at rates that were very similar, with those rates bearing little relation to the fiscal and macroeconomic fundamentals of the individual countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.44,0)">With the benefit of hindsight, this is a puzzling outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Clearly, a single monetary policy should imply a single money market interest rate, as well as a single long-term risk-free interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.93,0)">And with inflation expectations converging across the euro area, sovereign bond yields could be expected to become less dispersed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.86,0)">However, despite the single monetary policy, differences in the default risk of individual countries, consumers and firms remained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.31,0)">But financial markets were less wary of such risks, thereby establishing improper incentives for public and private sector borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.95,0)">One simple summary indicator of the degree of economic heterogeneity is cross‑country inflation differentials.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.86,0)">These reflect differences between countries in terms of the business cycle, productivity growth and the functioning of labour and product markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.64,0)">They also affect countries’ real interest rates, as well as the international price competitiveness of their goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.82,0)">Monetary union resulted in inflation differentials in the euro area falling to a level comparable to the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,109.57,0)">However, although the two had inflation differentials of a similar size, the persistence of those seen in the euro area remained much greater, pointing to the possible existence of macroeconomic imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.25,0)">As a result, since the introduction of the euro, the persistent inflation differentials in the euro area gave rise to a divergence of relative prices that is twice as large as the one observed in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.23,0)">The main driver of those persistent inflation differentials is related to the cross‑country differences observed since the introduction of the euro in the implementation of structural reforms and has little to do with real convergence or so‑called “Balassa-Samuelson effects”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.93,0)">In some euro area countries, governments failed to implement the necessary reforms in their product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Consequently, wage growth exceeded productivity growth and prices rose faster than in other countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">These inflation differentials led to divergent developments in international competitiveness and contributed to the accumulation of unprecedented current account positions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">In a number of countries, this all led to economic activity gradually shifting away from the more export-oriented manufacturing industry towards the more domestically oriented construction sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.26,0)">Because sectoral reallocation is typically a slow process, it is very difficult to now readjust those countries’ economies quickly in response to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.72,0)">In addition, in most countries there is a high degree of downward wage rigidity, which is a further impediment to rapid adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.56,0)">Accumulation of private and public sector debt in some countries Moreover, the persistently higher inflation rates in some countries implied persistently lower real interest rates, particularly in light of the high degree of convergence in terms of nominal lending rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.1,0)">Countries with lower real interest rates experienced stronger credit growth and housing booms, which placed further pressure on wages and prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.51,0)">Lower real interest rates also meant that it was easier for governments to borrow, slowing down fiscal consolidation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.89,0)">Governments did not adopt sufficiently counter-cyclical policies to limit their own accumulation of debt or to counteract the accumulation of debt in the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In fact, because those economic booms were based on stronger domestic consumption and rising property prices, they led to improvements in cyclical fiscal balances as long as the boom went on, so that governments had few incentives to tighten fiscal policy before the bust set in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.12,0)">The accumulation of imbalances was exacerbated by institutional deficiencies The question naturally arises as to why this unsustainable degree of heterogeneity occurred in the euro area and not the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.02,0)">In the United States, regional imbalances tend to be more mean-reverting, owing to higher levels of labour mobility and more flexible product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.13,0)">At the same time, there is also less scope for unsustainable accumulation of debt at state level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.12,0)">Most states have adopted legislation that prevents them from accumulating the levels of debt seen in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.92,0)">The institutional design of the euro area has clearly given rise to moral hazard and lacked the capacity to credibly engage in measures to prevent rising imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Although there was an unseen accumulation of debt in some euro area countries, financial markets were allowed to set financial conditions in such a way that private and public sector borrowers in those countries could essentially continue to borrow at the same interest rates as borrowers in countries with much sounder fiscal and macroeconomic fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.87,0)">As a result, financial flows ran from countries with strong productivity growth to countries with weak productivity growth, fuelling a persistent economic boom based on the accumulation of debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">To be efficient, financial flows should instead have run towards countries with higher levels of productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Heterogeneity during the crisis and the ECB’s response The financial crisis has led to a strong increase in heterogeneity within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.01,0)">The re-emergence of cross-country differentials in terms of financial conditions has contributed to divergence in macroeconomic and financial fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,74.55,0)">Conversely, these heterogeneous financial conditions mainly reflect persistent fiscal, macroeconomic and financial imbalances, as well as persistent structural problems in several countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.21,0)">The first dimension of heterogeneity concerns real developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.4,0)">Some countries have recovered well while others continue to be affected by persistent structural problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">But some of the macroeconomic imbalances have begun to adjust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Competitiveness has improved in countries where labour costs used to persistently exceed the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.43,0)">That being said, such adjustment has remained too limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.06,0)">Sizeable imbalances persist, particularly high levels of public and private sector debt and vulnerabilities in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Looking ahead, it is of the essence that government policies decisively address these various fiscal, financial and structural impediments to growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This brings me to the second – and most evident – dimension of heterogeneity, namely the sharp divergence observed in financial conditions in euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.51,0)">In the course of the crisis, secured and unsecured money markets have become increasingly impaired, especially across national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.9,0)">Countries’ sovereign bond yields have diverged significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.34,0)">Corporate bond markets have also experienced tensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Overall, there is ample evidence that country-specific factors have become more important in driving yields.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.91,0)">The emergence of fragmented financial markets within the euro area began in the aftermath of Lehman Brothers’ default and intensified following the onset of the sovereign debt crisis in May 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Financial integration came to a halt and was partly reversed, as can be seen from the fact that non-bank debt securities were increasingly purchased domestically, with non-domestic euro area holders selling these bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.3,0)">Euro area countries’ financial sectors retreated within national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.66,0)">As a result of those fragmented financial conditions, the transmission of the ECB’s monetary policy stance to interest rates was increasingly impaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.27,0)">Moreover, banks in countries in which government finances were under strain faced restricted access to the money market and other sources of financing, given the interconnectedness between banks and sovereign states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.94,0)">Had this been allowed to continue, these funding restrictions would probably have hampered growth in credit to households and non‑financial corporations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.58,0)">This, combined with deleveraging needs, could have resulted in a “credit crunch” in several parts of the euro area, with negative consequences for the economy and price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">In reacting to this exceptional degree of heterogeneity, the ECB’s monetary policy continued to be guided by its objective of ensuring price stability for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Key ECB interest rates were reduced significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">In addition, non-standard measures were adopted in order to support the functioning of the transmission mechanism by bringing back liquidity to dysfunctional markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">For instance, in light of the constraints in funding markets for banks, the maturities of longer-term refinancing operations were successively extended, culminating in the three-year operations conducted in December 2011 and February 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.91,0)">Following these operations, funding constraints have eased, with money market spreads declining.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Moreover, the already broad collateral framework has been extended further, with corresponding risk control measures to mitigate the Eurosystem’s exposure to risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">This has made it easier for collateral-constrained banks to continue to participate in refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Overall, banks’ recourse to refinancing operations has been particularly strong in those countries that have been worst affected by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">While open to all, the ECB’s non-standard measures have been used most intensively in countries facing financial stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.31,0)">Cross-country differences in the use of non-standard measures have thus largely reflected heterogeneity in financial conditions across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Our policy measures have helped to reduce heterogeneity in financial conditions thereby ensuring a smoother transmission of monetary policy across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.49,0)">The extent of the heterogeneity in banks’ financing needs can also be inferred from national central banks’ balances in TARGET2.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.87,0)">These balances reflect the national central banks’ net claims or liabilities resulting from commercial banks’ cross-border payments in TARGET2.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.12,0)">The increasing net liabilities of some national central banks are a reflection mainly of funding stress in their individual banking systems, with financial outflows being compensated for by increased recourse to Eurosystem refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Our policy measures have, in particular, increased the ECB’s intermediation between banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.59,0)">Looking at the interbank market, reduced willingness to lend, especially across borders, has hampered the distribution of liquidity to those banks that are most in need of it, particularly banks in countries facing financial stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Increases in deposits held with the Eurosystem by banks in financially strong countries can be seen as an indication of the degree of disintermediation in the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.82,0)">Banks in such countries tend to be recipients of cross-border payment flows and therefore need less central bank liquidity than banks in countries facing financial stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.55,0)">The surplus of central bank liquidity in banks in financially stronger countries has raised concerns that such liquidity could fuel asset price bubbles in parts of the euro area, potentially posing a threat to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.12,0)">These concerns are not warranted at the current juncture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Thus far, only a moderate recovery has been seen in asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">As regards the housing market, developments in money and credit – traditionally good leading indicators of booms in house prices – have remained subdued.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">However, we will continue to pay close attention to such developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Conclusion To sum up, the measures adopted by the ECB have contributed to greater homogeneity in the pass‑through of policy rates to the economy, with a view to maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.16,0)">However, monetary policy cannot provide a lasting solution to the underlying problems causing this persistent heterogeneity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">While the ECB can help to ensure a smooth adjustment process and offer temporary relief, this cannot replace the necessary structural adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Instead, governments need to act in a variety of policy areas – particularly as regards fiscal consolidation, structural reforms and financial stability – within a reinforced governance framework at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">This is the only way that we can put the euro area back on a sustainable growth path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.88,0)">The crisis has highlighted several shortcomings in the institutional framework of EMU, and these need to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.89,0)">This framework failed to ensure sound fiscal discipline in all euro area countries, as well as to prevent or correct the accumulation of financial and competitiveness imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.32,0)">Crisis management and financial sector repair – such as the rescue and resolution of financial institutions – were left to national authorities, despite considerable cross-border activity in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.21,0)">We saw only too clearly that the interconnectedness of banks and sovereign states can lead to adverse feedback loops between sovereign and bank financial conditions, with significant consequences for the macroeconomic stability of the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Several steps have already been taken with a view to enhancing the governance framework for EMU and improving the prevention and correction of fiscal, macroeconomic and competitiveness imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">At the same time, an overhaul of the framework for financial supervision and regulation has been initiated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">Finally, firewalls and crisis management instruments have been established in order to further safeguard financial stability, particularly by addressing the risk of contagion across countries and financial market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Looking ahead, further steps will need to be taken in order to supplement the single monetary policy with a more integrated framework for bank supervision, resolution and deposit insurance, as well as far more extensive coordination of government policies affecting competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">As the President said this morning, if we are to achieve this, euro area countries will inevitably need to surrender more national sovereignty and increase their coordination of national policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">The global economy is becoming increasingly integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.12,0)">The importance of national sovereignty has been waning as a result of increasing economic interdependence at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">It is an illusion to think that, in an integrated world, countries will be able to decouple themselves from developments in other countries.</span>
