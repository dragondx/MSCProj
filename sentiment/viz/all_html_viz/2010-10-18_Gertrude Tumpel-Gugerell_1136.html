    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.44,0)"> The Single Euro Payments Area - where do we stand?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB at the European Payments Council offsite meetingBrussels, 14 October 2010 In 1970 the first blueprint for a monetary union – the Werner report - was presented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Almost twenty years later, the Delors Committee report shaped the way to the start of Stage One of the European Monetary Union in 1990.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In 1999, the European Central Bank was established and the euro coins and banknotes followed in 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">The euro came a long way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">The logical next step of the introduction of the euro, a single cash instrument, is the introduction of single non-cash payment instruments facilitating greatly payments in euro across the single currency area and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.82,0)">Obviously, the euro was not realized in one day.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">But once introduced, it became our currency replacing the currencies of the participating member states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The same should apply to SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We cannot assume implementation over night but we do not have another 30 years to complete the euro introduction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Hence, SEPA payments instruments   must become the payments instruments for euro payments fully replacing national legacy instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Since the publication of the sixth SEPA progress report in November 2008, a number of major milestones have been reached in the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">For instance, the launch of SEPA direct debits in November 2009 has made cross-border direct debit payments possible for the first time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">By 1 November 2010 the reachability of payment accounts for SEPA direct debits will be legally ensured across the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">This will allow the effective use of SEPA direct debits throughout Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The governance structure of SEPA has been improved with the creation of the SEPA Council, which further formalises the involvement of high-level representatives of consumers, retailers, corporations and SMEs in the SEPA dialogue at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Progress has also been observed in the transposition and implementation of the Payment Services Directive and in standardisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.24,0)">However, there are also areas where developments have been unsatisfactory and greater efforts are required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">In some of these areas, much still needs to be done in order to further integrate the euro area retail market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">A regulation setting an end date for migration to SEPA There is a need for a realistic but ambitious end date to be set for migration to the SEPA credit transfer and direct debit schemes in order to reap the full benefits of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Although the potential benefits of the SEPA project are substantial, migration to SEPA cannot be described as fully successful yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.08,0)">In August 2010 only 9.3% of all euro area credit transfers were processed as SEPA credit transfers, and only a share of well below 1% of all euro area direct debits were processed as SEPA direct debits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">On the positive side, in November 2010 adherence and reachability will be ensured for the SEPA direct debit scheme, as banks will be legally obliged to be reachable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">A number of public administrations have committed themselves to migrating their payments to SEPA by the end of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Still, this will not be sufficient to achieve critical mass as regards migration to SEPA and will not, therefore, bring about a significant increase in the rate of migration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.41,0)">There are several reasons why migration to SEPA has been slow: the prevailing market uncertainty; the difficult economic climate; potential disadvantages for “first movers” in a network industry; and resistance to migrating fully from legacy to SEPA payment systems in the absence of a commitment to a specific end date.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">Two years ago, the banking community was unanimous in calling for an end date to be set for migration to SEPA by means of EU-wide legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Having a regulation is one thing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">However, appropriate communication and services for end users are also required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The negative perception of the IBAN and BIC standards in Germany could have been avoided by means of appropriate communication and measures that make the transition easier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.28,0)">Multilateral interchange fees for the SEPA direct debit scheme have proven to be a controversial issue that is difficult to resolve, and a long-term financial business model for the SEPA direct debit scheme still needs to be established.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">I hear the industry's legitimate calls for legal certainty on this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.44,0)">Whilst much has been done to provide clarity under the competition rules, the requirement of a case-by-case analysis under these rules may still substantially delay the true achievement of a level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Maybe this is one of the issues where the best way to obtain clarity is not by self regulation nor competition enforcement, but precisely within the framework of the legally binding rules themselves?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.91,0)">As regards, the migration end date itself, the ECB still has a preference for two different migration end dates for the SEPA credit transfer and direct debit schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">On the basis of an assessment of the migration efforts deemed necessary, the ECB preferred migration end date for the credit transfer scheme would be November 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">As a logical consequence of this, the ECB would envisage an end date of November 2013 for the direct debit scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, the actual end date for migration to SEPA will be determined by the European Council and the European Parliament by means of the co-decision procedure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.64,0)">Overall, not having a regulation is not an option.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">We all look forward to the upcoming draft legislative proposal by the European Commission and we hope that the proposal is published as soon as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Towards a competitive European payment card market Calls for an additional European card scheme The SEPA card framework developed a few years ago presents three ways of establishing a card scheme that achieves the overall objective of citizens being able to use the scheme’s cards anywhere in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">This could be achieved by: replacing a national scheme with an international scheme  ; developing a payment card scheme covering the entire euro area, either by means of alliances with other card schemes or through expansion; co-branding with an international card scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.15,0)">The Eurosystem expressed reservations regarding the first and third options.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">It was felt that the first option – the “replacement strategy” – would lead to a situation where Visa Europe and MasterCard progressively became the sole providers of card payment services offered by banks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.8,0)">The third option – “co-branding” – was deemed less favourable because it would perpetuate the existing situation, where schemes are protected from competition by national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.37,0)">If the majority of schemes were to opt for co-branding and this situation were to become permanent, the market would remain highly fragmented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">SEPA customers would not benefit from economies of scale or competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">National schemes would, in all probability, retain national business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Cross-border transactions would be effected only through Visa Europe and Mastercard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Instead, the Eurosystem expressed a preference for the emergence of an additional European card scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This was the position of the Eurosystem four years ago, and it remains its position today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.82,0)">There is a clear risk of the vast majority of the national card schemes – some of them rather efficient as they are – leaving their market share to Visa Europe and Mastercard and competition being reduced to a duopoly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.96,0)">This would mean less choice, less competition, and less European governance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Therefore, an additional European card scheme can have a lot of benefits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Three initiatives are currently under way with a view to creating an additional European card scheme: the Euro Alliance of Payment Schemes  , Monnet and PayFair.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Further initiatives are obviously not excluded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">It seems that the development of a proper financing model is probably the most important issue from banks’ point of view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.27,0)">And here again, uncertainty about multilateral interchange fees is considered an obstacle to any progress in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,52.7,0)">The criticism that there is a lack of clarity in this area does not fully recognise the commitments made recently by MasterCard and Visa Europe on multilateral interchange fees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">One should also recognise that the European as well as national competition authorities have already provided some guidance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">However, here too, regulation might provide a solution of last resort and a possibility to look at the business model in the context of other business rules and market circumstances that presently stand in the way of an effective market providing efficient services against optimal prices to consumers and other customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Overall, I believe that an additional European scheme – safe and efficient as the best performing existing ones - is a necessary element of an integrated and competitive market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Separating card schemes from processing entities The concept of separating schemes from processing entities is one of the core elements of SEPA to guarantee open access.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The SEPA credit transfer and direct debit schemes are built on this principle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This concept should be applied in the card market, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Indeed, banks should have a range of options to choose from as regards the processing of card payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The separation of schemes from processing entities has many dimensions, comprising operational, informational, financial/accounting, commercial and legal separation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Major efforts need to be made by individual schemes in order to achieve effective separation in these various domains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Three things are needed in the area of card processing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">First, the processing of card transactions should use the same set of message standards as the processing of direct debits and credit transfers  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Second, a framework is needed for the processing of card transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">And third, the various infrastructures need to develop the rules and standards that are needed in order to establish technical interoperability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">In December 2009 the European Payments Council   agreed to update the PE-ACH/CSM framework to include card transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">However, work still needs to take off on this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Cards standardization Another important issue is cards standardisation and a security certification framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The standardization of cards is a crucial element to ensure the interoperability of cards and a harmonized use of cards across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In the area of standardisation, the EPC remains in charge of the strategic vision and business rules for cards, while the Cards Stakeholder Group establishes functional, security and procedural requirements and deals with the maintenance and development of the “Book of Requirements”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This document provides the basis for the technical SEPA standards necessary to allow any card to work at any terminal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Various market initiatives have developed implementation standards and specifications in the card-to-terminal, terminal-to-acquirer, acquirer-to-issuer, and certification and type approval domains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.49,0)">However, work on the implementation of these specifications is lagging behind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In the field of security certification for cards and terminals, the implementation specifications have been developed by CAS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">The Eurosystem welcomes this work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">However, governance-related aspects of the SEPA security certification framework are still under discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The Eurosystem expects the EPC and CAS members to agree on concrete proposals for a permanent governance structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">From a European perspective, it is of strategic importance to adopt a more coordinated approach to global standard-setting bodies such as ISO and EMVCo.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Secure retail payments are key The security of retail payments is a key issue as regards consumers’ and businesses’ trust and confidence in SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The risk-based approach adopted by individual banks may be sub-optimal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Commercial risk tolerance may differ from social risk tolerance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">SEPA requires a harmonised minimum level of security for retail payments in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">With regard to the level playing field for the security of payments, there seems to be a need for greater clarity about both the actors involved in defining security requirements across Europe and the requirements set by these actors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Moreover, there needs to be a common understanding about the substance of certain security requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The ECB supports the establishment of a forum to monitor market developments and foster further harmonisation of security standards within Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Market participants are expected to implement state-of-the-art measures to improve information security and prevent payment fraud.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">For online “card not present” payments, market participants should introduce state-of-the-art authentication procedures and migrate to them by end-2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In this respect, a liability shift   should apply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The ECB is also of the opinion that from 2012 onwards, all new SEPA cards should, by default, be issued as “chip-only” cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This view is shared by Europol.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.46,0)">If the industry decides to keep the magnetic strip for practical reasons, any data enabling magnetic strip transactions should be removed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">In both cases, the industry will have to be prepared to offer cardholders cards with legacy magnetic strips on request for as long as there are still regions outside the SEPA area which have not fully migrated to EMV.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Concluding remarks It is the role of the ECB, acting as a catalyst, to point out what remains to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We will do this in a new SEPA progress report, which is currently under preparation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The most important issue for now is to get clarity on the end date for migration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The ECB welcomes the fact that the Commission is about to issue a draft regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This should be done as soon as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Furthermore, the market should focus on cards, and the EPC needs to play a key role – from the standardisation of cards and certification to the involvement of end users and the representation of Europe in global standardisation initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">We expect the EPC to remain active in these domains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.29,0)">At its introduction, the euro was - to some extent – confronted with criticism and scepticism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Today, the euro is a solid currency, we – the ECB – have delivered on our primary objective to maintain price stability and the euro has fared well even in the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">We can, therefore, say that the euro has been a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">I strongly believe that the same will be true for SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">Once the many advantages of SEPA become fully realized and acknowledged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">SEPA will be a great success.</span>
