    <h3> Speaker: Jean-Claude Trichet </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)"> Creating an integrated market for the euro area Speech by Jean-Claude Trichet President of the European Central BankConference “SEPA Summit”at the Euro Finance Week Frankfurt am Main, 13 November 2006 Ladies and gentlemen, It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to this conference on the Single Euro Payments Area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">The ECB is committed to the success of the SEPA project and therefore decided to contribute to the organisation of this SEPA Summit in Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">I am pleased that we could attract some of the key decision-makers in Europe   to this two-day event.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">I welcome Mr McCreevy, Commissioner for the Internal Market, who will share his views on the developments in the creation of an Internal Market in the field of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I also welcome the members of the two panels this afternoon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">Today’s conference is an excellent opportunity to discuss the opportunities that SEPA and, more generally, financial integration offer for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">On this occasion, the ECB is also distributing for the first time its brochure on SEPA, which is intended to provide an informative overview of the project, also for those not involved in this issue on daily basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Our main message is that SEPA will only become a reality when all euro payments in the euro area are treated as domestic payments and the current differentiation between national and cross-border payments disappears.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">I am aware that this calls for everyone to make substantial efforts, as it requires not only the alignment of national practices of the banking industry, but also changes in habits from economic actors in all euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Indeed, the SEPA project is – in ambition and size - comparable with the changeover to the euro banknotes and coins, although the logistics are quite different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">SEPA could be seen as an important historical step in the unification of Europe after the introduction of the euro banknotes and coins.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The progress with the SEPA project that has been achieved up to now by the industry is impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Looking back on the discussions on improving cross-border retail payments less than a decade ago, it was surely difficult to imagine that such a remarkable market-led movement called SEPA would be achieved to foster financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">The SEPA project has activated a real modernisation process which, in turn, will generate other adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">It is thanks to many individuals, many of whom are here today, who have continuously driven the project, that such progress has been possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">The banking industry has been able to join forces with the European Payments Council   to become the driving force behind the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">I would like to share some thoughts with you today on three topics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">First, I would like to explain briefly the ECB’s interest and involvement in the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In particular, I will underline that, for the ECB, progress in financial integration is crucial and the status quo in this field is not an option.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">As a second topic, I would like to address some of the factors that are essential for the success of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Finally, I will present my thoughts on the outlook for SEPA as a truly integrated payment market in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">Financial integration and SEPA Let me explain briefly the main economic benefits of financial integration, stemming first from the better sharing and diversification of risk, and second from the increase of the potential for higher economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">Concerning the first aspect, financial integration in the euro area facilitates a better sharing and diversification of the risk of potential shocks, because it will allow, for example, economic agents from one region to invest more easily in other regions of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Economic agents will also be able to choose payment service providers from different regions, or choose providers that have back-up facilities in different regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Financial integration is therefore relevant for the stability of the financial system, as it improves the financial system’s ability to adsorb adverse disturbances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Concerning the second aspect, financial integration also increases the potential for greater and more sustainable economic growth, as it will increase the capability for economies of scale and scope, and thus increases investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">For example, an integrated financial system, with harmonised rules, standards and practices across the different countries, would allow for more rationalisation, consolidation and expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The integration process will foster competition and innovation, and drive down costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Indeed, the opening-up of markets will allow payment service providers to offer their services in other euro area countries, which will increase competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The euro area has already achieved a significant degree of financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">In this respect, removing the fragmentation of retail payment markets will contribute further to financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">SEPA, with its harmonisation and restructuring efforts, is a crucial factor in opening up the different national retail payments markets, allowing euro area-wide competition and fostering innovation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Let me now continue with the fields which have to be covered to foster financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">How to reach SEPA?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In essence, financial integration is achieved when three conditions are fulfilled:   singleness of the market,   market participants’ equal access to the market, and   market participants’ equal treatment in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">For the retail payments markets, this means that market participants must be subject to a single set of rules when dealing with payment instruments or services, have equal access to the payment services or products, and be treated equally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">I see three main barriers which have to be removed if the euro area is to become a more integrated retail payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.07,0)">These are the technical, commercial and legal barriers which exist between the current national payment markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.32,0)">The first barrier is a technical barrier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Of particular importance for SEPA is the development of common technical standards, which enable the smooth connection of systems and the transfer of messages between different players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.24,0)">Technical standards are the basis for payment systems, and could also be referred to as the “plumbing” of the financial system, ensuring the transfer of funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">National fragmentation through standards should belong to the past and common standards for the euro area should be in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The ECB fully supports the work of the EPC in this field, which has cooperated with the International Standards Organisation   to develop these standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The second barrier is a commercial barrier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">For SEPA, the development of a common set of rules and business practices is a necessity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is referred to as the “rulebooks” that ensure a common treatment for transferring funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">The EPC has agreed on the common rulebooks for credit transfers and direct debits, and a framework for card payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This single set of rules will allow different entities to provide core services throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The ECB fully supports the EPC’s work in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">We also subscribe to the concept of separating the rules from the processing services, as it will allow operations on a European scale and bring an end to vertical integration, in which scheme rules are set by the processors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.28,0)">The third barrier is the legal barrier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.32,0)">The current regulatory differences across the euro area hinder the provision of efficient and automated services throughout the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.13,0)">The proposed Payment Services Directive will remove these legal barriers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The Directive – and there we are privileged to have later on the explanations of Mr McCreevy - will create a clear and homogenous framework for making payments in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The Eurosystem strongly supports the work on the Directive, as it will establish the legal certainty which is necessary for operations across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">An early adoption of the Directive is key, as it will facilitate the implementation of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Given the importance of financial integration, and SEPA in particular, the ECB is acting as a helping hand or “catalyst” for private sector initiatives and is monitoring the progress of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">As a catalyst, the ECB devotes particular efforts to fostering collective action in the private sector to address coordination problems, which hamper financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">The ECB also provides guidance and has made its expectations clear so that the SEPA project does not become a short-term solution for cross-border payments, but becomes an ongoing project that will bring the euro area closer to having an advanced retail payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Let me now turn to the success factors for SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Success factors for SEPA As part of any good project, it is important to have a clear vision and achievable deadlines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">The Eurosystem, in cooperation with the European Commission, has defined a common vision for SEPA, which should inspire the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">We see SEPA as “an integrated market for payment services which is subject to effective competition and where there is no distinction between cross-border and national payments within the euro area”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">For euro area citizens, this implies that they will be able to make cashless payments throughout the euro area from a single payment account anywhere in the euro area, using a single set of payment instruments, as easily, efficiently and safely as they do today in the national context.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This vision provides the basis for SEPA and guides the different initiatives of the banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Indeed, the vision has become the “leitmotiv” for changes in the retail payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">To realise the SEPA vision, strong commitment from all the stakeholders is required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">The ECB and the Commission are eager advocates of the SEPA project as it brings an integrated and competitive market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Furthermore, the European banking industry has shown commitment by launching several initiatives to create SEPA, and by setting up the EPC to drive the different industry initiatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">More recently, public administrations have also shown their commitment to SEPA, as the ECOFIN Council in October expressed its strong political support for the creation of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">The success of SEPA depends on the commitment of all stakeholders, and this will be facilitated when the advantages of SEPA are made as visible as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Let me therefore share with you some thoughts on the benefits of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">For consumers, I expect that they will be able to make their euro payments throughout SEPA from one bank account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">They will be able to use payment cards anywhere in the SEPA, and they will be able to make convenient cross-border bank transfers and direct debits from anywhere in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">For corporations and retailers, I expect that they will be able to simplify their European business management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">They will also be able to collect direct debits and payment cards from anywhere in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The more competitive market will lower operational costs of payment cards and will at the same time ensure a more consistent acceptance of cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">For the banking community, I expect an increase in competition and cooperation across euro area borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">I also expect that market efficiency will increase, as better prices could be negotiated for the euro area and new services will be provided to increase automation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The migration towards SEPA, however, also introduces some challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.86,0)">For example, the banking industry is expected to be confronted with initial investment costs in particular, which will clearly have an impact on the business of the banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.37,0)">Corporations and retailers show concerns about the evolution of prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">It is important for the success of SEPA that these concerns are addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">Listening to the community, the ECB has tried to better understand the potential effects of SEPA for the different stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In general, we expect that the overall impact for the banking industry will vary according to different scenarios and stages of the SEPA project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.6,0)">In the short run, the coexistence of SEPA schemes in parallel with the national schemes is, for example, expected to lead to initial investment costs and a relatively neutral impact on the revenue side for the banking industry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In the long term, when national schemes are replaced by SEPA schemes, the costs for banks are expected to decrease because of potential cost savings, for example from rationalisations, economies of scale and innovations  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.64,0)">The revenue side will also be affected as competition increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The impact on costs and revenues will be determined by the approach chosen by the banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Banks that take a forward-looking view and opt for additional services which will automate the payment process will create new business opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The changes which are required in the initial phase of the setting-up of SEPA are certainly substantial, and benefits can be reaped especially by those institutions that embrace new technological developments and provide innovative services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.86,0)">This leads me to my last thoughts on the outlook for SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Outlook for SEPA The Eurosystem’s outlook for SEPA is a truly integrated market, where all euro payments are treated as domestic payments and the level of safety and efficiency is at least on a par with the best performing national payment systems today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">The Eurosystem will closely monitor the developments of SEPA, and will pay particular attention to characteristics of an integrated market, such as singleness of the market, equal access to the market and equal treatment in the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">It is important the SEPA will finally bring about the creation of a single market where payments are equal to and ideally will surpass the speed and convenience of the best performing current national systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">I expect the SEPA project to be future-oriented and of a high quality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">It is also important for the single market that all stakeholders are informed and consulted on their requirements in the development of SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">All parties involved should intensify their dialogue on SEPA.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The ECB will increase its communication with users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We intend to hold a conference with corporations and merchants in 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Conclusion Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">SEPA is crucial for the euro area, because it fosters financial integration and brings benefits to the citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Considerable efforts have been made to enhance financial integration, and more efforts are still to be made to achieve a truly integrated market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Taking a longer-term perspective, SEPA should be seen as a continuous project of steps towards financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">The ECB and national central banks of the euro area will provide guidance and assistance to make SEPA a success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">I am confident that the changes initiated by the industry in cooperation with authorities will pave the way for an integrated and more competitive retail payments market for the euro area, which will foster innovation, better products and services, and better prices.</span>
