    <span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)"> International Research Forum on Monetary Policy Opening address delivered by Dr. Willem F. Duisenberg, President of the European Central Bank, Frankfurt, 5 July 2002.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Governor Gramlich, It is a pleasure to deliver the opening address of a new transatlantic dialogue – the International Research Forum on Monetary Policy – sponsored by the European Central Bank  , the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Center for German and European Studies at Georgetown University   and the Center for Financial Studies at the Goethe University here in Frankfurt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">The European Central Bank is glad to host the first meeting of this research forum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">I am particularly pleased to welcome Governor Gramlich here today, an esteemed colleague and member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">He will put his seal, so to speak, on this forum on behalf of our colleagues on the other side of the Atlantic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">I should also like to welcome the representatives of the Center for German and European Studies and the Center for Financial Studies, as well as all those who will present or discuss a paper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">This forum brings together not only central bankers from both sides of the Atlantic, but also academics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Moreover, I should like to thank the organisers of this first International Research Forum, in particular Ignazio Angeloni, Matt Canzoneri, Dale Henderson and Axel Weber.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Since the establishment of the ECB – four years ago – the dialogue between the ECB and the Federal Reserve System has gradually intensified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">It is fair to say   that it took the Federal Reserve System some time to realise that the Eurosystem – the ECB and the national central banks of the countries that have adopted the euro – has become the central banking system of the second largest currency area in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Admittedly, it also took the Eurosystem some time to grow into this role, but it has now done so and is seen to have done so, both inside and outside the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.55,0)">Contacts between the ECB and the Federal Reserve System reached their most intense level shortly after the tragic events of 11 September last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The swap arrangement between the Fed and the Eurosystem, which aimed to prevent a shortage of US dollar liquidity in European markets, was one result.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The concerted monetary policy actions on 17 September was another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">It is also interesting to note that ties between the Federal Reserve System and the Eurosystem have grown stronger in basically all areas of central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The International Research Forum represents a new link in this network of contacts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It will bring together central bankers and academics from both sides of the Atlantic to discuss new research on the theoretical and empirical aspects of monetary policy that are relevant to the euro area and the United States, but that are also relevant from a global perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Moreover, the dialogue will be an ongoing event; we plan to hold meetings like this one on a regular basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.44,0)">The next one will be in Washington DC, on 14 and 15 November 2003, hosted by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Looking at the programme for today and tomorrow, I can identify three categories of research, and most of the research to be presented here is not limited to just one of these categories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">First, we have issues which are at the heart of monetary policy-making, and which are of great relevance to central bankers worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For instance, work on financial integration and monetary policy, on inflation persistence, and on optimal monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Second, we have research on cross-country comparisons involving the United States and the euro area, and on issues that concern both currency areas, such as regional inflation in a currency union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Finally, we have papers on the international dimension of monetary policy-making, including policy co-ordination, the macroeconomics of international price discrimination, the currency denomination of international trade as well as inflation dynamics and international linkages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Let me touch on one issue which my colleague Otmar Issing will consider in greater depth at dinner tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">It follows from my introductory remarks about increased co-operation between the Federal Reserve System and the ECB, namely international policy co-ordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">Although I am very much in favour of intensifying the dialogue between the two institutions – I am sure we can learn a lot from each other – I am, at the same time, one of the first to recognise the limitations of international policy co-ordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Indeed, we should distinguish between international co-operation and international co-ordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In the latter case, policy-makers do not only pursue domestic goals, but also explicitly take into account the impact of their actions on the outside world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The economic literature – both theoretical and empirical – is clear on this issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">In the stylised and imperfect world of an economic model, policy co-ordination is mostly beneficial, in terms of welfare gains  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is the conclusion that emerges from the early literature on policy co-ordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.41,0)">However, if you try to elaborate this stylised and imperfect world, for instance by introducing transaction costs, uncertainties regarding the true economic model, or game theory considerations, the conclusion is different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Under these circumstances, the gains from international policy co-ordination are non-existent – and a regime of non-co-ordination would in fact be better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">This conclusion from the more recent literature is consistent with the policy line taken by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.54,0)">Asking monetary policy to do more than maintain price stability, or to serve other purposes, risks creating illusions about what monetary policy can do, as Otmar Issing will explain tonight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In addition, a central bank's ability to steer interest rates can only be used to serve one objective, which is – in most cases – to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This can be achieved either by targeting the exchange rate, a policy typically pursued by small and open economies, or by employing a monetary policy strategy that focuses on the internal stability of the currency, which is the ECB's strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.25,0)">Going beyond this is quite a difficult exercise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.76,0)">Some of the arguments against international policy co-ordination also apply to policy co-ordination within the euro area, an issue which will be discussed at the Convention on the Future of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">As you might be aware, some commentators and politicians say that policy co-ordination should be stepped up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">I agree as far as economic policies are concerned – at least to some extent – but I have serious doubts about any increase in co-ordination between monetary and economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">It is obvious that monetary and fiscal policy-makers should exchange views on macroeconomic policy in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">This is already done at the meetings of the Eurogroup, and it is highly appreciated also by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.67,0)">However, an ex ante co-ordination of monetary policy and fiscal policy is a completely different story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Policy-makers in these two fields have clear and separate mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Monetary policy aims to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Fiscal policy should comply with the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.7,0)">Mixing up these mandates would unnecessarily complicate policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.62,0)">It would blur competencies – which are well defined in the Treaty on European Union – and might undermine the ECB's credibility as the guardian of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.27,0)">And as the research shows, the gains that can be expected from such ex ante co-ordination are non-existent, or even negative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">Indeed, I am convinced that the European Central Bank and fiscal policy-makers can best contribute to a stable macroeconomic environment by sticking to their respective mandates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, one final word before I hand over to Governor Gramlich: I have not been able to read all your papers, but I am sure that they will provide a more than valuable addition to the body of economic literature and will deepen our understanding of monetary policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">I should like to wish you all a very fruitful conference.</span>
