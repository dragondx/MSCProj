    <span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)"> 2017 – a decisive year for innovative retail payment services Keynote speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the French Payments Committee conference on “Technological innovations in payments and beyond”, Banque de France, Paris, 6 January 2017 Introduction Between Christmas and New Year, many TV programmes and magazines looked back at events, cultural and political, that shaped 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Focusing on the field of payments innovation, I will also begin with a very short review of the events of last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But the main part of my speech will be dedicated to looking ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">In particular, I will discuss why 2017 is going to be a decisive year for the success of innovative retail payments services in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">In 2016 the foundations were laid for pan-European innovative payment solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In the scheme layer, the European Payments Council   finalised the framework for pan-European instant payment solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The instant payment scheme is the basis for the Europe-wide implementation of instant credit transfers, as well as the launch pad for other innovative payment solutions, such as person-to-person mobile payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">Fostered by the Euro Retail Payments Board  , work is under way not only on instant payments and mobile payments, but also payment initiation services and e-invoicing, among other things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">In the clearing layer,   automated clearing houses   agreed and committed to a pan-European approach for clearing instant payments in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">This approach consists of   harmonised risk management,   a uniform settlement procedure in TARGET2 and   fair and open access policies to facilitate interoperability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.46,0)">In the settlement layer, the Eurosystem launched an investigation into providing a pan-European instant payment settlement service in central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">With these foundations in place, 2017 will see decisive action in all three layers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.94,0)">First, payment service providers will have to deliver instant payment solutions to the end users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Second, most ACHs will be ready to launch their instant payment clearing systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">And last but not least, the Eurosystem will decide on whether or not to provide a pan-European instant payment settlement service in central bank money to payment service providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">I would now like to look more closely at two specific areas of action: how the Eurosystem – in its role as catalyst – will continue to drive European retail payment integration by fostering the provision of pan-European instant payment solutions, person-to-person mobile payment solutions and payment initiation services by the industry in 2017; how the Eurosystem – in its role as operator – could advance the retail payments market by offering instant payment settlement services in central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Fostering European retail payments integration – deliverables the Eurosystem expects from payment service providers in 2017 For the Eurosystem, a major challenge of digitalisation in the payments industry is ensuring that the introduction of innovative payment solutions does not  introduce fragmentation into the European market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is understandable that, initially, most innovative retail payment solutions delivered by the industry tend to focus on national markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.2,0)">However, I want to be very clear here and emphasise that innovative solutions that do not have the potential to extend their reach at pan-European level are not in line with the expectations of the Eurosystem and the goals of the Single Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The three most important areas for improving the user experience in retail payments are instant payments,   mobile payments and payment initiation services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">In conjunction with the European legislator and the ERPB, the Eurosystem, in its role as catalyst, fosters pan-European developments in all three areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Instant payments In line with the expectations of the ERPB, the Eurosystem encourages payment service providers to make instant payment solutions in euro available to end users at a pan-European level from November 2017.     mobile payments Aligned with the timeline for the implementation of the instant payment scheme, the Eurosystem expects the launch of a standardised look-up service that allows   mobile payments using the mobile phone number of the payee as a proxy for the IBAN.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This service should be launched by the end of 2017 and should not be restricted to national IBANs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Payment initiation services In line with the ERPB, the Eurosystem expects the market to work on the definition of a common set of technical, operational and business requirements for the development of an integrated market for payment initiation services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These requirements will be based on the provisions of the Payment Services Directive and the related Regulatory Technical Standards  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">They should become available in 2017 so as to leave sufficient time for the relevant market actors to implement them by the time the RTS apply  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Advancing the retail payments market by offering instant payments settlement services in central bank money The provision of innovative retail payment solutions does not depend only on the payment service providers, but also on the availability of a safe and efficient underlying market infrastructure that can process instant payments across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.85,0)">Payment service providers should have the choice to either clear their instant payments through ACHs or use a settlement service for instant payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">With regard to the clearing of instant payments, the Eurosystem supports industry efforts to establish interoperability between ACHs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">In its catalyst function, the Eurosystem obtained the commitment of the clearing industry to adhere to a number of conditions, facilitating the processing of instant payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">As operator, the Eurosystem is enhancing the TARGET2 functionalities as relevant to address ACHs’ needs by November 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">These steps need to be complemented by concrete interoperability arrangements between ACHs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">In this regard, the Eurosystem encourages the industry to establish operational links between ACHs by the November 2017 deadline.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">With regard to the settlement of instant payments, the Eurosystem is investigating the possibility of offering a settlement service for instant payments in central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.49,0)">Instant payments require gross, real-time processing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">The proposed settlement service, which is called TIPS  , would leverage the pan-European nature of TARGET2 to offer settlement of instant payments directly and without credit risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Three days from now, on 9 January 2017, the Eurosystem will launch a market consultation on the user requirements for the centralised settlement service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">I would like to take this opportunity to unveil some of the features the new service could have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">First, TIPS would help participants to comply with the SEPA Instant Credit Transfer   scheme by providing pan-European reachability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">Common functionalities across jurisdictions would ensure harmonisation of practices and market integration in the settlement of instant payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Second, participation in TIPS would follow the same criteria as participation in TARGET2.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is not intended to change the criteria for access to central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Those who do not have access to central bank money   may establish contractual agreements with a TIPS participant to use the participant’s TIPS account for the settlement of instant payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">They may also be authorised by the participant to instruct directly on this account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Third, it goes without saying that TIPS would respect the principle of full cost recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(94,255,0)">It is anticipated that the price per transaction would not exceed 1 euro cent, with the aim of ultimately reaching a level of around 0.5 euro cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Fourth, market participants would be able to connect to the service via a network service provider of their choice, as long as this network vendor meets the criteria that the Eurosystem will establish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The Eurosystem is committed to taking a decision in June 2017 on whether to develop the service.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">TIPS could commence operations in 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Conclusion To conclude, we can look forward to 2017 being a year of decisive action for innovation in retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The main deliverables at the consumer end of the payments chain are pan-European instant payment solutions and a service for   mobile payments using the mobile phone number as a proxy for the IBAN.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In the payment service provider domain, a common set of technical, operational and business requirements for the development of an integrated market for payment initiation services is to be developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">In the market infrastructure domain, the Eurosystem is committed to taking a timely decision on whether to build a settlement service for instant payments in euro in central bank money, leveraging the pan-European nature of TARGET2.</span>
