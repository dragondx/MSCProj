    <span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)"> Promoting innovation and integration in retail payments to achieve tangible benefits for people and businesses Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the American European Community Association, Brussels, 7 February 2019 New technologies are transforming the entire economy, our daily lives and also the way we pay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Digitalisation is a strong driver of innovation in retail payments and can help to deliver customer-friendly solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In a parallel development, people now tend to expect that services – and payments – should be delivered instantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">At the ECB, we are very much aware of these trends, and we are promoting innovation in our economy by providing new services such as TARGET Instant Payment Settlement  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">We closely monitor all new developments in the market with a view to fostering change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">However, we must bear in mind that increased digitalisation means that more and more of our daily actions are leaving an electronic trail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.81,0)">Data on our actions – including our payment transactions – are not only captured automatically, they are also stored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This means that they can easily be reused for other purposes or, as recent events have shown, misused.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Data protection has therefore become a matter of paramount importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Private data should be sufficiently protected and only used with the consent of and for the benefit of consumers and citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the United States there is an ongoing social and political debate on the subject, while here in the European Union the General Data Protection Regulation was introduced in May last year to that end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The GDPR sets out the rights of individuals, such as the right to request access to their data, the right to receive and forward those data, and the right to be forgotten.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.09,0)">The Regulation also places obligations upon entities processing personal data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">In the context of work in Europe on retail payments, protecting users’ rights and enhancing the right to data privacy is vital when it comes to developing innovative payment solutions and strengthening users’ trust in them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">This is especially true for the new payment services introduced in the context of the revised Payment Services Directive  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">With the user’s consent, third-party providers of payment initiation services and account information services are able to access payment accounts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Banks and other market participants are currently dedicating considerable effort to the implementation of communication interfaces.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">The Euro Retail Payments Board   – the high-level strategic body that brings together the supply and demand sides of the euro retail payments markets – recommends an easy, secure and, as far as possible, automated solution in the form of a standardised application programming interface  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">To ensure the successful implementation of such interfaces and to bring about their pan-European uptake and reach, the ECB believes that a harmonised and integrated approach is necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Services based on access to a payment account have huge potential, for example where third-party providers offer competitive payment initiation services to merchants or aggregated account information to consumers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Demand for such services is growing worldwide, and several legislative and regulatory initiatives have been introduced to encourage competition and innovation in financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">Indeed, PSD2 can be seen as a first step along the path towards “open banking”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">This is an opportunity for EU market stakeholders to shape the work on open banking and to demonstrate that we are able to progress towards that objective – in a coordinated way, for the good of European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.82,0)">Banks should not see third-party access to accounts as a threat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">Instead, they can capitalise on their PSD2 investments in APIs and offer value-added services, for example by including in the API other accounts beyond the pure payment accounts covered by PSD2, by offering additional functionalities for payment initiation services, or even by extending the API to other services such as customer authentication.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Such value-added services could then be fairly compensated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">I believe that such an approach would be mutually beneficial for banks and third-party providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">For this reason, the ERPB set up a working group to explore the scope for an API access scheme in the Single Euro Payments Area  , as well as the legal and governance aspects of such a scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">The group has now started delivering on its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">For the working group to be successful, banks should see the evolution towards open banking as an opportunity to renew their innovation strategy and client focus, in a changing global environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Instant payments are another enabler for innovative payment solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In Europe, the SEPA instant payments scheme and the various processing and settlement arrangements, including the Eurosystem’s TIPS service, are all in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">TIPS was launched last year and allows transactions to be settled in central bank money across Europe within seconds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">The capacity to transfer funds within a few seconds is a powerful one, and it has great potential beyond traditional credit transfers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">However, the market will need to tailor solutions to the specific needs of end users.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">One highly promising area is the point of sale, or more broadly the point of interaction  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">For merchants, instant payments at the POI could be a cost-efficient alternative to cards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Such solutions are currently emerging across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">It is important to ensure that they have pan-European reach so that end users can make and receive payments without restriction across national borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">To this end, the ERPB set up a working group to analyse in detail the barriers to pan-European reach and usability and ways to overcome them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Many of the innovative payment solutions introduced over the past few years have been based on the use of card payment schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Although payment cards are the most widely used payment instrument in Europe, a true SEPA for cards has not yet been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.85,0)">For example, cardholders cannot use their national payment cards to make payments across Europe unless they go through a global card payment scheme that can execute such intra-European payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The industry sees the implementation of a European infrastructure for instant payments as an opportunity to instantly clear and settle card transactions, which would offer a possible way of supporting the interlinking and interoperability of national card schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Efforts to ensure the interoperability of schemes should be strengthened and should aim to foster a European identity, for example by using a common European logo to show users that their cards can be used across the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.37,0)">Let me now conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Digitalisation has brought a great deal of change to the payments market, and there is more on its way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">The GDPR and PSD2 have been introduced to protect EU citizens and to support competition in payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">For its part, the Eurosystem is helping to drive innovation and integration in retail payments, not least by providing instant settlement services through TIPS and setting up the ERPB as a forum for high-level market agreements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The main areas for further development are standardised APIs, instant payments at the point of sale, and the interoperability of national card schemes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">I look forward to proactive cooperation with the payments industry in these areas, based on joint standardisation and harmonisation.</span>
