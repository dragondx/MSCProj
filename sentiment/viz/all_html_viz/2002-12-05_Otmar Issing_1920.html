    <h3> Speaker: Otmar Issing </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)"> Why stable prices and stable markets are important and how they fit together Professor Otmar Issing, First Conference of the Monetary Stability Foundation, 5 December 2002, Frankfurt/Main The subject of this panel discussion why stable prices and stable markets are important and how they fit together is indeed a very broad one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.69,0)">I therefore choose to restrict my comments to four issues.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First I will quickly discuss what is a reasonable definition of price stability and remind us of its importance for overall economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Second, I will briefly characterise a stable or well-functioning market mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In doing so I will highlight the dynamic aspects of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Then I will elaborate on the general relationship between stable prices and stable markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">At this point, I would imagine, my statement will not have triggered much controversial discussion neither among my distinguished colleagues on this panel nor among the experts participating in this conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But this might change during the fourth, final and main part of my statement, in which I will apply the general theme of this panel to one very specific market - the market for financial assets - and discuss the relationship between price stability and financial market stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">To be more concrete, I intend to focus on one particular and most interesting branch of the current literature, which claims that we have entered a new regime in which central banks' victory over general price inflation comes at a price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,91.21,0)">The alleged price is that a low inflation environment is conducive to more financial instability in the shape of boom and bust asset price cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.06,0)">As a consequence, it is pretended in the literature, central banks have explicitly to react to the build up of financial imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.06,0)">I will argue later on - and I would be surprised if anyone in this room is surprised - that I am not convinced about the detrimental effects of low and stable inflation nor of the need to change the focus of our monetary policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">I will rather try to convince you that the ECB's monetary policy strategy is sufficiently robust to deliver optimal monetary policy decisions even in a new regime environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">I assume that at this point few of you will complain about a lack of controversial issues for discussion, in which case I would have successfully played my role as a panelist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Defining stable prices Let me start by defining what can be meant with stable prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.85,0)">Obviously stable prices can only mean a stable price level   or a low level of inflation and not stable individual prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.83,0)">Stable individual prices would erode the advantages of a market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.41,0)">Or as Hayek argued convincingly "because all the details of the changes constantly affecting the conditions of demand and supply of the different commodities can never be fully known, or quickly enough be collected and disseminated, by any one centre, what is required is some  …, which automatically records all the relevant effects of individual actions, and whose indications are at the same time the resultant of, and the guide for, all the individual decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This is precisely what the price system does under competition and which no other system even promises to accomplish."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">There is no doubt that signals stemming from changing relative prices are a most crucial and beneficial input to economic decision making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.01,0)">In this regard a related issue directly concerning monetary policy is the possibility of sectoral or regional differences in inflation within a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.4,0)">The issue is whether the existence of a target for low inflation for the whole union, for example below 2%, does not entail the structural risk of deflation in certain regions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.33,0)">With regard to the threat of deflation, one should not confuse relative price adjustments with overall changes in the price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">As I have dealt with this and the problem of deflation in general in a speech in London early this week  , I just want to say that we currently see no risks for deflation in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Inflation forecasts of major international institutions and financial market participants confirm this view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.82,0)">Even if a reduction of prices were to occur at some point in the future in any individual country of the European Monetary Union, its consequences would be very different from those of deflation in the whole area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.23,0)">The zero bound on nominal interest rates, to mention an often-quoted problem related to deflation, would not be binding in the first case for the euro area as a whole   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I mentioned that stable prices can only mean a stable price level or a low rate of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I will not dwell on the issue which of the two then is to be preferred   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Let me say only so much that this depends on the weight you attribute to the existence of nominal rigidities, and transition costs from one to the other regime on the one side and the general benefits of higher price level certainty and the lower probability to remain stuck in a prolonged deflation on the other side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">Nominal downward wage rigidities favour a low inflation definition, which is Tobin's   "grease the wheels of the economy" argument, while a price level objective would increase the probability that a negative real interest rate can lead the way out of a prolonged deflation due to a higher credibility of the central bank's commitment to future inflation   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">As you all know, the ECB has opted to define price stability as an annual increase in consumer prices of less than 2%, to be achieved over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">We thus have chosen the low inflation definition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.53,0)">The decision not to centre the definition of price stability around zero is due to possible measurement bias, likely problems at the lower bound of zero nominal interest rates and again the possible existence of nominal wage rigidities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Costs of inflation I would not be a "top to toe" central banker, when I would miss the opportunity provided to me by the title of this panel to remind us why price stability is important for economic performance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">As this is largely known territory, a short list of the costs of inflation will be sufficient   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.89,0)">Among the best-known costs of anticipated inflation are the so-called "shoe- leather" costs, which are the search costs incurred whilst looking for alternative stores of value to real money balances, which do not bear interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.15,0)">Second, menu costs assume a fixed cost every time prices are changed, and higher rates of inflation require a higher frequency of price changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Third, non-indexed fiscal systems increase the distortionary effects of taxation by bracket creep and by reducing the after-tax return of investments - for example, when depreciation allowances are not adjusted for inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.57,0)">Fourth, residential property might be discouraged when anticipated inflation shifts the real burden of fixed nominal mortgage payments closer to the present time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.58,0)">Fifth, inflation in the presence of nominal rigidities as formalised in Taylor contracts or Calvo pricing produces costs due to relative price distortions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.76,0)">Let me finally add that in dynamic general equilibrium models inflation creates inefficiencies in distorting agents' decisions on the choice between labour and leisure and on the size of investments in financial services   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.62,0)">Due to the predominance of nominal contracts unanticipated inflation creates costly real effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.63,0)">The costs encompass wealth redistribution effects from creditors to debtors, thus possibly from old to young agents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.89,0)">Second, uncertainty about future inflation will distort investment decisions towards real assets and eventually reduces the overall level of investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.98,0)">Third, Lucas'   misperception theory points out that inflation puts a veil on relative price signals and is likely to lead to resource misallocation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Empirical estimates concerning the size of these costs vary, but the literature   hardly leaves a doubt about the general conclusion that empirical evidence confirms significant welfare costs of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.43,0)">Let me also mention that calibration results from more recent dynamic general equilibrium models tend to produce rather larger costs of inflation than we are used to find in traditional partial equilibrium type of analysis   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Defining stable markets Let me turn to the second part of the title and briefly elaborate on one possible definition of stable markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Obviously a stable market has nothing to do with a market where prices and transacted volumes are constant, rather the contrary is true.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">I would define a market as stable when it produces an efficient economic outcome.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">An efficient economic outcome would be attested when the following functions can be confirmed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.78,0)">Factors are allocated to their most productive use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Supply   adjusts swiftly to changes in the production technology and changes in demand, and Incentives for market participants are such that productive improvements are rewarded and thus "technological" progress promoted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In a stable market so defined, the price mechanism can fully play its allocation and information role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">I would also consider the dynamic adjustment ability as crucial, which in turn is the key constituent element of a functioning market economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In the following I will discuss the relationship of stable prices and stable markets referring to the example of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Thus let me already here introduce financial markets as an illustration of the above definition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Financial markets provide the means to allow agents to shift consumption over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Their existence as such is thus already welfare improving.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">A stable financial market should ensure the efficient allocation of savings to investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">A stable financial market should be able to accommodate financing needs and provide risk-sharing opportunities also in face of significant technology shocks   and demand shocks   without major disruptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The incentives for producers of financial services should reward prudent risk management and lead to continuously improving investment and financing vehicles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Financial markets are special in the sense that the time dimension and thus the dynamic definition of stability is obviously crucial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.73,0)">Financial market prices - in the first place interest rates - link the present to the future being themselves largely determined by time preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.63,0)">Current asset prices depend on present values of expected future returns and constitute a claim on future consumption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.71,0)">It follows that instability encountered in financial markets will almost by definition affect a host of intertemporal contracts, with possibly wide ranging externalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">and how they fit together I turn now to the third part of the title.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.73,0)">What is then the relationship between stable prices and stable markets?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me first mention that the Austrian school - contributors like Hayek, von Mises and Lachmann - perfectly anticipated Lucas misperception theory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.53,0)">Lachmann   , for example, explicitly mentioned that inflation confuses the signals send by individual price changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.2,0)">With inflation, prices still transmit information but incomplete information, which has to be interpreted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.01,0)">And according to Hayek persistent deviations from static equilibrium can be attributed to constantly changing information imperfectly conveyed between agents whose knowledge is different   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.37,0)">Thus a straightforward interpretation of the Austrian school is that inflation can prevent the market mechanism of providing an efficient resource allocation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.13,0)">Actually inflation could negatively affect all three functions, which I used in the definition of stable markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.19,0)">As already mentioned, inflation disrupts efficient resource allocation due to the aggravation of the asymmetric information problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.67,0)">Inflation furthermore disturbs the adjustment of supply to changes in demand due to veiling relative price signals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.1,0)">And finally, inflation could stall technological progress by diverting entrepreneurial effort towards hedging and exploiting the effects of inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.15,0)">Thus on this abstract level I would claim that inflation has the potential to destabilise otherwise stable markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Turning again to the more tangible example of financial markets, the conventional wisdom is completely in line with the view that inflation increases the likelihood of misperceptions about future return possibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.48,0)">Inflation, for example, deteriorates the asymmetric information problem between lenders and borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.29,0)">A business cycle boom accompanied by high inflation is traditionally considered as the typical environment in which real over­ investment and asset price bubbles blossom.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.28,0)">Excess liquidity provided by the central bank is one of the main factors for the development of inappropriately lax lending standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.01,0)">After excessive return expectations failed to realise and the bubble bursts, missing then to accommodate the demand for liquidity in the economy will exacerbate the crisis especially when deflation could trigger a Fisherian vicious debt-deflation cycle   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Inflation is followed by deflation, or: stable prices play an important role for stable financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Strong protagonists of this view even claim that price stability is almost a sufficient condition for financial stability   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.91,0)">Others are more careful and simply state that price stability will tend to promote financial stability   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.11,0)">I think it is difficult to argue against the basic notion of the latter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.54,0)">Price stability and financial stability both cannot be achieved in a sustainable way one without the other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">They tend to mutually reinforce each other in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">This widespread view is supported by empirical evidence that many financial crises were caused by major shifts in the price level   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">From a conceptual monetary policy perspective, this situation is relatively benign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">At each point in time the central bank would attempt to maintain price stability   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">This is the best guarantee to simultaneously foster financial stability   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">If successful, the central bank would prevent the build-up of financial imbalances in the first place and in case of a crisis, supplying liquidity would prevent deflation and stabilise the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.99,0)">Moreover, historically most banking crises occurred during recessions   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">This is comforting for central bankers in the sense that the likely policy stance to maintain price stability will also be appropriate for the state of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.99,0)">On the other hand we also know that the world is not always as well behaved as we would wish it were.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">We know that financial imbalances can build up even in an environment of stable prices - think for example of the US in the 1920s and 1990s and Japan in the late 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Thus we must be aware that price stability is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.66,0)">This means that if the central bank has a primary objective to maintain price stability over the medium term, simply pursuing an inflation targeting strategy according to an inflation forecast of one or two years horizon might not be the optimal policy strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.48,0)">The first inflationary and later deflationary pressures associated with developing financial imbalances might not receive the appropriate weight in the forecast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.03,0)">Optimal monetary policy cannot avoid that, at times, strains in the financial system might be such that deviations from simple inflation targeting have to be accepted in the short run, in order to preserve price stability over the medium to long run   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Indeed, this is one of the reasons why the ECB has always stressed that its two pillar based monetary policy strategy is more - and especially more robust - than simple inflation forecast targeting.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.97,0)">I will come back to this point at the very end of my presentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">New challenges to the traditional view: a new regime of central banking?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">I will spend the remaining time discussing some recent ideas concerning the role inflation plays for financial market stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,127.21,0)">It has been suggested that the conventional wisdom that price stability is good for financial stability has to be reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This - at least for central bankers of my generation - provocative view, has been presented in several very recent BIS research working papers but is also spreading in the academic world   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.54,0)">Interestingly, very first signs of a discussion along these lines can be found in the FOMC minutes of the November 13, 1996 meeting, a few weeks before Chairman Greenspan made his famous "irrational exuberance" speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.63,0)">During the FOMC meeting Governor Lindsay mentioned being preoccupied by the thought that the central bank's success of keeping inflation under control could trigger a too optimistic outlook on the future course of economic development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.81,0)">Peoples' false sense of security could lead to asset valuations, which could pose problems for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">He said that "either the   market will stop rising or we will have to decide whether we are going to make it stop by injecting a little risk into the process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,173.9,0)">And, frankly, I think that call is going to be our toughest decision in the years ahead."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Since then additional arguments have been forwarded to explain how "low and stable inflation can make the system more vulnerable to booms and busts…”   In this recent literature   it has been argued that the inflation process has undergone a structural change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.91,0)">First of all, firms pricing power has been significantly reduced due to global competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Second, positive supply side developments like the reduction of marginal costs due to faster growth of total factor productivity and labour market reforms have subdued inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">And third, inflation expectations by the public at large have been anchored at very low levels due to the success of central banks monetary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.85,0)">This environment is meant to describe a new regime for central banking, in which it became much more difficult to conduct pre-emptive monetary policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.63,0)">The reason is that for quite some time inflationary pressure might not show up in inflation itself, due to the mentioned low pricing power of firms, positive supply side developments and well anchored low inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.65,0)">It has been argued that central banks' focus on price stability is insufficient and financial imbalances would have to be addressed directly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This direct response could consist of two parts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It would first involve trying to avoid   the building up process of financial imbalances and second - if the former was unsuccessful   to smooth the adverse consequences when imbalances are being unwound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Also Chairman Greenspan seems to subscribe to some degree to this analysis, although he rejects the policy recommendation to attempt to burst a developing bubble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">In his remarks at the 2002 Jackson Hole symposium, he mentioned that "accumulating signs of greater economic stability over the decade of the 1990s fostered an increased willingness on the part of business managers and investors to take risks with both positive and negative consequences."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Then he continued "nothing short of a sharp increase in short-term rates that engenders a significant economic retrenchment is sufficient to check a nascent bubble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.99,0)">The notion that a well-timed incremental tightening could have been calibrated to prevent the late 1990s bubble is almost an illusion."</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.1,0)">I share Chairman Greenspan's concern about the feasibility of pricking an asset price bubble without triggering a severe recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But let me raise a few other critical remarks with regard to this view on the suspected perils of low inflation and the suggested new regime for central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.17,0)">First, are we sure that low inflation has really been the cause or at least one of the causes of recent financial imbalances, by which I mean the boom and bust share price development in the major stock exchanges in the last six years?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">At least two other developments occurred simultaneously, one of which is the positive supply side shock usually referred to as the new economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.67,0)">Should realised and/or expected productivity gains associated with the new economy have been largely overrated by investors, this could alone explain the asset price bubble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,169.22,0)">It is not clear what was the part - if any - of subdued inflation in triggering collective euphoria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">A second candidate is financial liberalisation and integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Several authors have pointed to the fact that only in the 1990s was financial liberalisation and integration advanced to an extent that compared to previous decades we observed huge increases in cross-border portfolio and direct investment flows   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.59,0)">Financial liberalisation itself could be one factor, triggering investors' excessive optimism or inviting misallocation of resources   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,157.48,0)">A well- documented example of the possibly detrimental effects associated with the changeover to a regime of liberalised financial markets is the dismantling of international capital controls in Japan in 1979   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.62,0)">The seed of the financial imbalances in Japan were rather the transition problems associated with financial deregulation than low inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.6,0)">Baring further evidence, I would be hesitant to include low inflation among the prime suspects for triggering excessive optimism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.58,0)">The claim that correlation can be interpreted as causality in this particular case seems premature to me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.06,0)">Second, the new regime view implicitly assumes that investors do not learn and will continue to behave irrationally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.18,0)">If it turns out that low inflation really contributed to an overly optimistic investment climate, nothing guarantees that next time this has to happen again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.26,0)">We should not forget that the recent years of low inflation so far do not represent more than a relatively short episode in modern economic history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">Thus some adjustment costs could be expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.71,0)">For example, the lengthening of planning horizons in a low interest rate environment, certainly has positive economic effects in the long run, but could introduce a particular kind of uncertainty related to inexperience with discounting events further away in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">But one would expect that an appropriate risk premium would soon be reflected in prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Investors might learn and realise that a benign outlook for short-term inflation must not imply that higher equity valuations are necessarily fundamentally justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.57,0)">Investors might forego this particular fallacy next time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Third, assume the inflation process would really have changed on a permanent basis so that inflationary pressures - visualised by rising inflation figures - remained subdued for a long period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is even then not obvious that we would need to speak of a new regime for central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Would it not be sufficient for a central bank to make sure that monetary policy is sufficiently forward-looking?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">This would imply that the outlook for future price stability is based on indicators, which are able to detect any currently subdued inflationary pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Again one could think as an example of monetary and credit developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.41,0)">Obviously this raises a political problem, which is that it might be difficult for a central bank to tighten its policy stance as long as no evident signs of inflation are visible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Providing and safeguarding a central bank's independence from the political sphere might be the best way to attack this problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Fourth, even thinking about the latest boom and bust period in equity prices, we should not be too sure that imbalances had absolutely to be avoided.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,170.61,0)">In his book "Famous first bubbles" Garber   has argued convincingly that one should never prematurely interpret the failure of macroeconomic experiments as proof that investors were foolish and irrational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Investors had to position themselves in a new environment and come to an evaluation of success probabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.37,0)">In a situation where even among experts disagreement about the correct measurement, source and effects of productivity growth were widely debated, this has been a challenging task for the private sector as well as central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">I have high esteem for the staff at the Fed or the Eurosystem, but I can see no reason why a central bank should be better positioned than market participants in carrying out these evaluations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.23,0)">Obviously one could discuss to which degree a central bank would need to know whether a bubble is a bubble or whether it would not be sufficient to react to some leading indicators of financial distress   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">The latter appears to be a more reasonable suggestion, worthy of further research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.16,0)">Fifth, the policy conclusion to be drawn from the claim that low inflation increases financial instability is not clear to me and could potentially be dangerous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.27,0)">Should a successful central bank on purpose create higher and more volatile inflation, in order to remind investors that central banks can spoil a party?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Finally let me briefly analyse how the ECB's monetary policy strategy is constructed to deal with this challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">There is ample empirical evidence that financial imbalances are created by means of extensively leveraged investments and thus are reflected in the credit demand of the private sector and credit is one of the counterparts of M3.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Thus a monetary policy strategy that monitors closely monetary and credit developments as important driving forces for consumer price inflation in the medium and long run - as done under the ECB's first pillar -as an important side effect also contributes to limiting the emergence of unsustainable developments in asset valuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.62,0)">Monetary aggregates and credit developments in situations of financial instability can signal to what extent consumption, investment, labour and price setting decisions are affected by conditions of financial disorder, excessive euphoria or disillusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.3,0)">And a central bank would be badly advised not to exploit this source of information.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.48,0)">In times of financial distress, the assessment of the first and second pillar could give different signals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">In the first place, and this not a minor aspect, this result would ask for increased caution on monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Should the development of financial imbalances be -obviously a delicate matter of judgement - considered as a major threat to price stability over the medium run, the central bank will act giving more weight to the first pillar and deliberately accept a short term deviation of actual inflation from its objective in order to achieve price stability over the medium run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The policy stance would be like the one advocated by new regime proponents, which is a tightening in the build up phase of a positive bubble and an easing after balances start to unwind in abrupt downward corrections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">But to be very clear, such an outcome would still be the optimal policy strategy for a central bank primarily concerned with price stability over the appropriate time horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,116.89,0)">It would not be necessary to target any asset price or pursue a separate financial stability objective, which could commit the central bank with dangerous consequences for the long run stability of the financial system and the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.63,0)">From this perspective it does not matter whether financial imbalances build up in low or high inflation periods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">When the central bank is forward-looking enough, it will set policy rates in order to avoid any inflationary consequences stemming from credit financed asset price booms as well as avoid any deflationary tendencies in times of financial distress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">Before I conclude let me still mention that there is another very recent literature, which suggests that a central bank should immediately respond to asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.56,0)">Some people have argued within the framework of dynamic general equilibrium models that in the presence of nominal rigidities, imperfect competition, and the possibility of non-fundamental asset price movements  , the central bank would face a trade­ off between an inflation distortion and an investment distortion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.62,0)">Both have to be optimally balanced, as monetary policy cannot take care of both simultaneously   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Other results qualify this point arguing that an inflation targeting central bank is well able to contain both distortions   simultaneously, as long as we face   shocks to productivity growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.95,0)">Shocks to the net worth of companies instead can again create a trade-off between price stability and optimal investment   .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.52,0)">I have no time to discuss this interesting branch of the literature in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Let me just mention that even if inflation is not the only distortion in the economy I still need to be convinced that the central bank is the best placed institution to deal with the other distortions before I would accept the relevance of these trade­ off findings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.22,0)">Thus to summarise, while having some doubts that secular victory over inflation can be declared and even more doubts that low inflation tends to cause financial instability, I also fail to see how a central bank following a monetary policy strategy like the ECB would be systematically misled in its policy decisions even in a new regime environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.26,0)">I do acknowledge that in permanently changing circumstances and especially in transition periods between different regimes, the conduct of monetary policy becomes - in practice - particularly challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The importance of a robust strategy cannot be overestimated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">As I have tried to explain, the ECB attempts to live up to these challenges.</span>
