    <h1> National supervision in a European system: What is the new balance? </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Fifth FMA supervisory conference, Vienna, 30 September 2014 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Sabine Lautenschläger </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)"> National supervision in a European system: What is the new balance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, Fifth FMA supervisory conference,Vienna, 30 September 2014 Mr Ettl, Mr Kumpfmüller, Ladies and gentlemen, Nine months ago to the day, the Finanzmarktaufsicht   issued two press releases announcing major “restructuring measures”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">According to the FMA, banking supervision in the euro area would be built on “new foundations” in 2014 and the year would bring new tasks and challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I really like the building site metaphor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It isn’t hard to imagine what the challenge of laying new foundations and constructing a new building – especially during regular operations – means.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">This event today is about national supervision in a European system and where the new balance lies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The focus is therefore on the stability of the European supervisory building.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Now, there are clear rules or conditions to be complied with when constructing a building.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.61,0)">Tasks and responsibilities must be clearly defined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.43,0)">Everybody needs to know what to do or to leave alone – and that goes for the Single Supervisory Mechanism  , too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">The European supervisory building, consisting of the ECB and 19 national supervisors, isn’t a single family home, but a large building complex; a structure that should be sturdy and stable, even in stormy conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Expectations of the developer European legislators and the public, too, expect the SSM to ensure a resistant, robust banking system in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">Supervision in Europe is rightly expected to be better than what 19 national supervisors could achieve with national means.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The new system of supervision should be neutral and not wedded to national thinking and traditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">It should, where appropriate, produce a level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.55,0)">It had become apparent in the financial crisis that the difficulties of large, strongly interlinked banks were not just a national problem and that difficulties can spill over into the public sector and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The SSM is supposed to identify any risks that may endanger national financial markets or the European financial market as a whole at an early stage and take measures to counter them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">It should be assertive and able to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">If it is set up properly, the SSM can indeed meet the majority of these expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">A European supervisory body will be able to identify risks early on and act effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The SSM will be in a position to provide a considerable part of what a supervisor can do for a resistant banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Among other things, the division of tasks between national supervisors and the ECB will ensure this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">But not all the developer’s wishes can be fulfilled or are feasible, as the resistance of the European banking system or the performance of a national credit institution don’t just depend on the supervisor’s performance and ability to act.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">In order to be resistant in the long term, a bank needs a sustainable business model; it needs sufficient income in order to bear the risks associated with banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">After all, it shouldn’t be forgotten that the balance sheet of a bank – especially a bank with extensive corporate banking – is always a reflection of the economies in which it operates as a financial service provider.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Construction planning – dimensioning the building But let’s leave the expectations and go back to the building itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.23,0)">At the beginning of every construction project is the planning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The architect has to bring the wishes and expectations of the developer into line with all kinds of existing restrictions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The final purpose of the building needs to be clearly defined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">With regard to the SSM, this means that, for practical reasons, direct supervision of all institutions in the euro area was neither feasible nor wanted right from the outset.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.02,0)">Fully centralised supervision would’ve had the considerable disadvantages associated with an organisation being too large, the resultant burdens for all concerned – which would be considerable – and a loss of national and regional expertise concerning the specific characteristics of banks in the Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">What added value would have been brought by direct ECB supervision of the many smaller institutions, which often have regional roots?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.55,0)">What challenges would’ve arisen in terms of linguistics alone?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.66,0)">After all, without having a detailed look at a large number of credit files, it isn’t possible to properly supervise most of the banks which are active in private and corporate banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">National language skills are indispensable here for discussions with the Executive Board and employees, as well as for looking into the files.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Furthermore, it wouldn’t have been feasible to set up direct supervision of all banks in the euro area within a year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, when it came to the dimensions of our building, it was once again a question of striking a balance between the advantages and disadvantages of a central or decentral solution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">For supervision to function in the euro area, a balanced relationship must be achieved between centralisation and regionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.97,0)">Making the building as big as possible must not, then, be an end in itself, because the foundations for this are lacking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Significant institutions The architects of the SSM thus decided that only the largest banking groups with cross-border activities in the euro area should be directly supervised by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The national supervisory authorities in the euro area countries will thus continue to be the main contact for the remaining banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">So the SSM will directly supervise what are known as significant institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This category consists of 120 banking groups with around 1,200 individual institutions, which hold more than 80% of the total banking assets in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.81,0)">If things were to get difficult, these banks could have a significant impact on the stability of the financial system in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Eight of these banking groups are Austrian.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.18,0)">Less significant institutions All 3,500 other institutions will be indirectly supervised by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The decisive point is that the national supervisor remains the direct contact for the credit institutions and generally takes the associated supervisory decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">But there will also be some changes in terms of the supervision of less significant institutions, because the SSM will influence the supervisory approach of the national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Through rules, guidelines and recommendations, the SSM will steer the national supervision of less significant institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The aim of this is not to make everything the same; it is rather to ensure that a uniformly high level of supervision is achieved in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The sole aim must be to ensure a level playing field for all and to prevent blind spots on the supervisory map.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.88,0)">The term less significant institutions is, in fact, misleading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">There are certainly countries where individual institutions are not in themselves systemically relevant, but where the same cannot be said for these institutions taken together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.21,0)">In addition, the less significant institutions do not all look alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">They have balance sheets ranging from a few million euro to almost 30 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.33,0)">Some less significant institutions operate on a purely regional level, with business models that are sometimes very simple, but sometimes very specific, while others are cross-border institutions with very complex business models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The range is huge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The same is true of their characteristics and distribution in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Owing to their numerous cooperative banks and savings banks, Germany   and Austria   are home to the majority of less significant institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">This makes Austria our second largest “customer”, after Germany, in the area of indirect supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.86,0)">At the same time, there are countries that have very few such institutions: Cyprus, for example, will have seven such institutions in the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.34,0)">What does indirect supervision mean?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.96,0)">Let me say a few words on what indirect supervision actually means.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">Indirect supervision by the ECB consists of two elements, macro-prudential supervision and supervision of institutions and sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Macro-prudential supervision aims to identify and address deficits, in particular by comparing or benchmarking the various supervisory systems and approaches, and to spread and enforce best practice approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.39,0)">Institutional and sectoral supervision are about the institutions prioritising their levels of risk and the possible effects accordingly, thereby defining the intensity of the indirect supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.23,0)">Depending on which “class” of intensity the bank is in, the content of the reports will change in agreement with the various national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">For example, we’re currently working on the draft of a reporting guide for national supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This guide should provide an overview of the information the ECB requires.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.33,0)">After all, indirect supervision isn’t possible without information, unfortunately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The reporting guide will be an expression of the multi-stage supervisory approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.15,0)">The reporting requirements are differentiated according to the prioritisation of the institution, the type of information to be provided and the reporting interval.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.72,0)">For example, we will put into a high “intensity class” those institutions that may have considerable adverse effects on the financial system of their Member State in the event of a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">For these banks, we will supervise the activity of the national supervisory authority more intensively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">This way, the SSM can ensure high-quality supervision that follows uniform standards, even in individual cases, without subjecting each institution to an equally high intensity of supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">This applies first to those institutions that, as a first step, were classified by national supervisory authorities as institutions that require particularly intensive supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">In the not-too-distant future, however, there will be additional criteria, which will allow granular differentiation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I’m thinking here, for example, of institutions for which early warning indicators are sounding or banks that are growing large enough naturally to be regarded as significant banks through balance sheet growth or increasing interconnectedness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.53,0)">The consequence of the risk-oriented approach of institutional supervision is that the majority of the banks that, owing to their level of risk and their size, are classified as “low” or “medium” priority are subject to only very light supervision by the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This applies, for example, to the majority of cooperative banks and smaller savings banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">For the new European system of supervision, however, a sectoral view will be added, which we will develop further in the next few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">We want to identify institutions that together represent a concentration risk for the financial system and could therefore be systemically relevant as a group in the event of a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.06,0)">We describe these virtual groups as sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">We will be paying particular attention to this group.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Resources of indirect supervision To conclude the topic of dimensioning, I’d now like to say a few more words on the resources for indirect supervision in the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.86,0)">On the basis of uniform requirements, operational supervision for the 3,500 less significant banks has quite consciously been left to the national supervisory authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The distribution of staff in the new European supervisory body also takes account of this basic idea: while around 400 supervisors will take care of the 120 significant banking groups at the ECB, operational national supervision of the 3,500 less significant institutions will be accompanied by approximately 80 members of staff at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We are therefore quite consciously relying on the thousands of employees in the national supervisory authorities who, with their knowledge of specific regional characteristics, take care of this large group of banks on a daily basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Structural soundness The construction plans are in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">What regulations now need to be observed to ensure that the building is stable?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">I believe that four fundamental technical requirements need to be fulfilled:   First of all, a European supervisor needs a single legal basis which does not just determine the rules to be followed by the European banking sector, but also allows the supervisors scope for action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Only then will we be able to create a level playing field within the SSM area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The conditions for a single legal framework for banks and supervisors were put in place at the European level when the Capital Requirements Regulation   and the Capital Requirements Directive IV   entered into force on 1 January 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In addition, the European Banking Authority   in London is working on a single rulebook, a single interpretation of the legal basis for European banking supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This will take the form of binding technical standards on a variety of topics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The European Regulation and Directive contain a number of national options and individual solutions in order to cater for specific national features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">If the European legislator has left it up to the national legislator to transpose these options – as is the case in around 20 instances – and the national legislator has done so in the form of a law, the SSM must respect this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,135.1,0)">We have to apply national law, even if this might impair the level playing field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.66,0)">The situation is different when the European legislator has left the exercise of national options to the discretion of the supervisor, as has been done in around 80 cases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Over the past few months, we have made a list of all the national options and will come to a decision as soon as possible as to where we stand on every single one them, whether we will exercise them and if so, how.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The national supervisors will play an important role in this respect, as they are the ones that will have to explain the national features and the related risks to us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">They are the ones who should complement our knowledge of national markets and market structures, of national legal systems and risk trends.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">And we know, as supervisors, that some of these options are the result not of specific market structures, but of the continued existence of old traditions and popular habits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Good supervision in Europe requires knowledge and experience of individual national as well as European markets and market structures; it requires knowledge and experience of national and European legal systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Knowledge should be consolidated and decisions taken centrally at the European level so that attention is focused on the European interest instead of on the solely national interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The division of tasks within the SSM provides for just that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As I said, the ECB will take complete responsibility for the direct supervision of significant institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">But national supervisors will bring their knowledge and experience to the supervisory teams and support the ECB in its supervision, and they will do so in line with a single supervisory approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">It is our aim at the ECB to have detailed knowledge of the business model and risk profile of each of the 120 directly supervised institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">We want to be able to assess, at any time, the risk-bearing capacity, the internal control systems and the governance of banks, and to intervene at an early stage when we see danger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">In short, we intend to supervise intensively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.89,0)">I have already spoken in detail about the division of labour with regard to the less significant institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In both areas, then, knowledge of national and European markets will be brought together with a single evaluation system, a single supervisory approach and a central, European decision-maker.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">The third precondition for successful supervision in Europe is that macro-prudential oversight dovetails with micro-prudential supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is a case of complementing the supervision of credit institutions, which is very much concerned with individual circumstances, with important, well-prepared information that can only be obtained from the perspective of the euro area as a whole, or the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It is not just in the supervision of internationally active banks that it is important for the supervisor to know what risks are emerging in the financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And looking at it from the other side, national supervisors can carry out the important task of identifying national incentive systems and channels of contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Such information makes it possible to intervene preventively and at a much earlier stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The last and fourth condition for successful European supervision has to do with the SSM using the advantages of its size to the greatest advantage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">With powers of direct supervision over around 120 banks, the SSM has a broad knowledge base with which to identify risks at an early stage through cross-sectional analyses and comparisons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">For this reason the SSM will be able to rely on a strong horizontal function, which, together with the supervisors of the institutions, evaluates business and risk management practices at the banks and if need be formulates standards and establishes best practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">Preparation for further extensions A clever builder considers, even in the planning phase, whether it will be possible in future to meet requests to extend the building.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In the construction of the SSM European lawmakers have set clear rules on how EU Member States that are not part of the euro area can nonetheless become part of the SSM.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The rules for this close cooperation are there; so extensions are not out of the question!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">And to this I am very open, well disposed, as long as they meet certain conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The strict rules governing the construction of the main building must also be applied to extensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">For this reason, close cooperation is not designed as an agreement between the ECB and the country in question, but as the result of an application that has been accepted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">If an EU Member State that does not use the euro wishes to participate in the SSM, it must create the legal basis enabling the SSM to issue instructions and guidelines to its national supervisory authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is particularly important because, in non-euro area countries, the SSM cannot act directly vis-à-vis a credit institution but implements its decisions indirectly, via the national supervisory authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The banking system of a country that enters into close cooperation must of course undergo an extensive health check before the SSM takes on supervision – just as happens at present in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and Gentlemen, let me draw your attention one final time to our vast construction project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It is almost finished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Countless experts from the euro area have worked together on this project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">And here I am also talking in particular about my colleagues at the national supervisory authorities, from the Oesterreichische Nationalbank and the Finanzmarktaufsicht.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">With incomparable effort, they have helped to shape the project at all levels by means of expert knowledge, years of experience and manpower: from many, many working groups to the numerous staff who have come to prepare the day-to-day running of the building and make sure it can function over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">They have all made an essential contribution to ensuring that, from the plans to the operational phase, it has always been possible to maintain the balance between the necessary ultimate responsibility at the central level and the legitimate interests of the euro area countries in both planning and implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">This will continue to be so in the future, as the 18   member countries with their national supervisory authorities will also be prominently represented in the Supervisory Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">I have no doubt that our European supervisory project will be ready on time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.86,0)">There are exactly 35 days to go till the start date, 4 November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In Frankfurt we are currently working very hard on the start of regular supervisory operations at the ECB, as the responsibility for the supervision of around 4,700 credit institutions in the euro area will from that day on lie with us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The staff of the SSM has largely been recruited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.5,0)">A few interviews are still being held.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The way supervision will be carried out has been defined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.64,0)">The division of labour between the national supervisory authorities and the ECB has been laid down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.73,0)">Internal procedures have been set out in the Supervisory Manual.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">The part of the construction project covering significant credit institutions is virtually complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">The Joint Supervisory Teams, which will supervise the 120 significant banking groups, have already formed and are getting up to speed on their banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">In the part covering less significant institutions, our colleagues are currently gathering detailed information on the banking supervision systems and the population of other banks and their features in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This part will also be ready to operate on 4 November.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Ladies and Gentlemen, I am convinced that only by working closely together and ensuring a clear division of labour between national supervisors and the ECB will we be able to fulfil our mandate to make the banking system of the euro area more robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.07,0)">The foundations of the SSM will in future surely be exposed sometimes to uneven stress in one place or another.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.15,0)">This is completely normal for a building that stands for many years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">As long as we do not forget the principles applied by the architects of the SSM, it will always be possible for the ECB and the national supervisory authorities to together regain the right balance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">This is the prerequisite for ensuring that the primary aim of the SSM, high-quality banking supervision in the euro area, is met in the long term.</span>
