    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.44,0)"> Dinner speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Monetary policy: a journey from theory to practice - an ECB colloquium held in honour of Otmar Issing Speech by Otmar Issing, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBFrankfurt am Main, 16 March 2006 Dear guests, colleagues, friends What can, what should one say on such an occasion?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.24,0)">Abraham Lincoln, attending a funeral, once remarked: “If General so-and-so had known what a big funeral he would get, he would have died years before”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.56,0)">If I… I must not continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">And to be quite frank, I prefer to be able to hear what is said at such an exceptional moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(129,255,0)">Let me thank you all for joining us this evening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">I will have the opportunity tomorrow to extend my special gratitude to all who contribute to the unique colloquium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Therefore let me just thank you, Jean-Claude, and you, Martin…..</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">In his “Theory of Moral Sentiments”, Adam Smith wrote: “As ignorant and groundless praise can give no solid joy…it often gives real comfort to reflect, that though no praise should actually be bestowed upon us, our conduct, however, has been such as to deserve it…”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.89,0)">It is not for me to judge my conduct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Whatever I may have achieved is the result of life-long learning and close cooperation with so many people throughout my professional life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.38,0)">In economics, this process has never stopped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Having become a central banker, it was my privilege to build the bridge between economic research and monetary policy-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The title of the colloquium captures it nicely: A Journey from Theory to Practice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">From the beginning of my new life as a central banker I was able to benefit from close contacts with colleagues from all over the world who were ready to share their rich experience with me.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">I always felt it an invaluable advantage of my position, to be in permanent contact with so many leading researchers from all over the world – quite a few of whom are participating in this conference, so I should not start mentioning names.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Our discussions covered a broad spectrum.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">It helped me to be informed on a first-hand basis on important new developments in the field of economics and especially monetary theory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">For me as a central banker, the challenge was to understand progress in research and combine this with hopefully sound judgement of what is relevant and applicable in the practice of central banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me give just one example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Like all of us, as an academic I was deeply impressed by the convincing logic of the famous Lucas Critique.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.37,0)">As a central banker, it influenced my reflections on the potential implications of structural breaks in the context of German unification, and even more so at the start of European Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">The monetary policy strategy of the ECB – among many other results of research – reflects this important contribution to assessing the high degree of uncertainty under which policy has to be conducted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">At the ECB I have been fortunate to cooperate with outstanding colleagues on the Executive Board and the Governing Council.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">It has been a constant pleasure to work as a team with my staff of excellent economists, with bright minds and high motivation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.39,0)">Hardly a day has gone by on which I could not learn from reading their contributions and discussing the reasoning behind them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It has been my privilege to present the results of this cooperation to the decision-making bodies, thereby connecting economic analysis and research with policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This process goes in two directions: input into the decision-making process and impulses from that process for further studies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">We were all privileged to participate in an historically unique experiment: the creation of a new currency for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.68,0)">We had to manoeuvre through uncharted waters and we may not yet have arrived in the Promised Land.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The ECB is in many respects a very special institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">It is not only still a very young central bank, but also a place where people from now 25 European countries work together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">For our young staff, working for a European mission is a fact of daily life.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.84,0)">The older generation is still aware of a different time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">I vividly remember the day when Christian Noyer, then Vice-President, and I were reflecting over lunch on our national backgrounds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.6,0)">At the same time as his father was a prisoner of war in Germany, my father was a member of the German occupation army in France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Half a century later the sons of the two men were working together in Frankfurt for a common, European project.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">To the last days of my professional life I feel that I have had the most interesting job I could think of for an economist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.02,0)">Confucius once said: “Find a job you love and you will never have to work a day in your life”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.49,0)">I hope that this remark will not inspire my employer to think that I should not be paid anymore.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">I will still be around here for a few more weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Nevertheless, this is a moment of farewell.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Should I claim, like Achilles when he – temporarily – withdrew from the Trojan war, “All will yearn for me, all”?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.27,0)">Be assured, I am well aware that this is a moment in which you hear only nice words, from those who regret that you are leaving as well as from those who are looking forward to your departure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.79,0)">I would like to conclude with a famous example of the influence of changes in distance on the judgement of a person.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">In March 1815 the French newspaper Moniteur reported on Napoleon`s journey from Elba to Paris: March 10: The Corsican ogre has landed at Cape Juan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.28,0)">March 11: The tiger is in Gap.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,175.54,0)">Troops are on their way and will stop him.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.85,0)">He will end his miserable adventure as a homeless refugee in the mountains.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">March 12: The monster succeeded in proceeding to Grenoble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.09,0)">March 13: The tyrant is now in Lyon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.3,0)">Horror has caught the people.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,142.29,0)">March 18: The usurper is some days’ march distant from Paris.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">March 19: Bonaparte approaches in a hurry, but he will not succeed in advancing to Paris.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.85,0)">March 20: Napoleon will be in Paris tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.55,0)">March 21: Emperor Napoleon is in Fontainebleau.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">March 22: Yesterday evening His Majesty celebrated his arrival in Paris.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.71,0)">The jubilation cannot be described.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.11,0)">I can only hope that in my modest case the reversal of the sequence does not end where the news on Napoleon started.</span>
