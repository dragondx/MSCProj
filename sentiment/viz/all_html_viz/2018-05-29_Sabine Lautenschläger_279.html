    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.96,0)"> Monetary policy - end of history?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.5,0)">Speech by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, Center for Financial Studies Colloquium, Frankfurt, 29 May 2018 In 1992, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama announced the end of history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The cold war had just ended, and in Fukuyama’s view, this marked “the endpoint of mankind’s ideological evolution”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Liberal democracy had prevailed; the final form of government had been reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There was no need for history to continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.83,0)">Similar claims were made about monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The great moderation, for instance, was traced back to better monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">With this in mind, some argued that monetary policy had reached a perfect and final stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.22,0)">There was no need to evolve further; history had come to an end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.09,0)">Or had it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.97,0)">Well, it seems that the unexpected always happens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.73,0)">And when it does, it tends to push the end of history a bit further away.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is true for politics, and it is true for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.02,0)">The unexpected happened in 2008: the global financial crisis struck and undid the great moderation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.8,0)">History took a sudden turn and this threw long-held beliefs overboard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Academics as well as policymakers had to adapt their thinking and their doing – monetary policy was no exception.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Central banks around the world came up with new tools to keep the financial system and the economy afloat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">They became key players; some observers even referred to them as the only game in town.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.04,0)">Now, ten years later, there is one thing that weighs on many people’s minds: When will unconventional monetary policy end?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.2,0)">When will it return to normal?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.25,0)">It seems that many look no further than the exit from our unconventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.49,0)">But what will happen once we have reached the exit?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Will we return to the end of history?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.42,0)">Well, I don’t think so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.1,0)">First, there are still many questions that need to be answered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.16,0)">And second, the unexpected will happen again at some point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.95,0)">History does not end.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.66,0)">But before we discuss what will happen tomorrow, let’s take a look at today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Approaching the exit – slowly but surely For many months, we have been discussing the conditions for a gradual exit from our extraordinarily loose monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.59,0)">But some might now point to the latest economic data indicating that growth has lost some momentum and wonder if this is reason to be concerned, or even to change plans?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Well, first of all, we need to put the latest developments into perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Growth in the euro area exceeded potential growth for a couple of quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In 2017, the euro area economy grew by 2.5%, compared with potential growth estimates of 1.5% for the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.29,0)">Against this backdrop, one could expect to see it to slow down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.64,0)">And that’s what happened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(74,255,0)">In the first quarter of 2018, year-on-year growth was 2.5%, compared with 2.7% in the fourth quarter of 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.7,0)">We saw industrial production, excluding construction, decline in the first two months of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.06,0)">And both the composite output Purchasing Managers’ Index and the European Commission’s Economic Sentiment Indicator eased in the first quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">But both are still well above their long-term average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">So we are seeing that the pace of growth has become more moderate, but we are not seeing a turning point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">We remain confident in the strength of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,131.09,0)">After all, the things that are currently holding back growth seem to be temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.14,0)">There was the early timing of the Easter break, there was a strong outbreak of flu in some parts of the euro area, there was cold weather and there were strikes in some countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.62,0)">All this weighed on growth, but it won’t do so permanently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">We need to keep a close eye on all this, and we will.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">But for now, there is no need to rewrite the story.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The economic expansion remains solid and broad-based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Financing conditions are good, the labour market is robust with a historically high increase in jobs, and income and profits are growing steadily.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">In short: the real economy is doing well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.54,0)">By contrast, inflation so far does not seem to be recovering as convincingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.71,0)">This has left many observers scratching their heads as to why the current level of low inflation does not match the current state of the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.24,0)">It seems that inflation is responding less to the slack in the economy than would be expected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.86,0)">This disconnect between the real and nominal sides of the economy is the subject of intense debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.28,0)">In very general terms, there might be two forces at play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.26,0)">First, the Phillips curve might have changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.47,0)">It might, for instance, have flattened, or it might have shifted downwards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.3,0)">Empirically, it is very hard to determine which – if either – of the two things has happened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.48,0)">And that brings me to the second point, which is that we cannot be sure whether we are measuring slack correctly in the first place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.69,0)">The unemployment rate, for instance, is based on a narrow definition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.22,0)">Just think of people who work part-time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.75,0)">Officially, they are employed, but they could work more, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.09,0)">So, the amount of slack could be larger than we think.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">If that is the case, it’s no surprise that inflation has not kicked in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">That said, the economy is still expanding and, at some point, any remaining slack will be used up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(71,255,0)">As a consequence, pressure on wages will increase, and we are indeed already seeing wages edging up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Wage growth increased from 1.1% in mid-2016 to 1.8% in the fourth quarter of 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">In Germany, wages even grew at 2.7% in the first quarter of 2018.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This, in turn, will prompt inflation to pick up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">So I believe that all we need is a bit of patience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">All the conditions for inflation to kick in are in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.91,0)">So, June might be the month to decide once and for all to gradually end net asset purchases by the end of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.19,0)">But please do not misunderstand me here: I am just referring to the net purchases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">There is still the stock of assets we have already bought.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">And we will still reinvest any proceeds from maturing bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Just to put it in perspective: each month we buy assets worth €30 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">This compares with a stock of assets worth €2,400 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">What I want to say is this: even when we end net purchases, monetary policy will still be extraordinarily accommodative.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">And, at the same time, other tools will remain in place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The Eurosystem has, for instance, committed to granting banks unlimited access to liquidity against a wider range of collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(65,255,0)">With our targeted longer-term refinancing operations, we provided credit institutions with funding for up to four years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.87,0)">Finally, interest rates are still historically low and will remain so for some months to come.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A first hike around the middle of 2019 is not entirely out of the ballpark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">So, we are slowly but surely moving towards the exit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This is the next big thing to happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.5,0)">But it will not be the end of the story, let alone the end of history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.79,0)">Monetary policy will continue to evolve, new challenges will arise, and many questions still need to be answered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">I will discuss three of these questions now: First, does monetary policy need to refine its targets and update its toolbox?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.33,0)">Second, how should it treat financial stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.52,0)">And third, what is the relationship between monetary policy and the distribution of wealth and income?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.81,0)">Tools and targets As we know, when the crisis hit in 2008, central banks around the world had to rethink their approach in more ways than one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">And they are still doing so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.31,0)">What will monetary policy look like in the years to come?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Should we put some of the tools we used in the crisis near the top of our toolbox where we can easily reach them?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.45,0)">Or should we bury them and only dig them out again in the event of a severe crisis?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">And should we redefine our target?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">The debate on these issues, in academic and policy circles alike, has been lively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">So let us weigh the potential costs and benefits of redefining our toolbox and our strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let’s start from the beginning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.22,0)">The crisis called for very loose monetary policy, and we responded with our standard tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.88,0)">However, despite the ECB’s efforts, inflation remained at historically low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In January 2015, the Eurosystem thus announced that it would start buying government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">A year and a half later, in June 2016, it also began to buy corporate bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">So, the basic story is simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Once the Eurosystem had come to the conclusion that the standard tools were not sufficient to reach our objective, it turned to non-standard tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Asset purchases are one of those tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.4,0)">And they have made our job as central bankers even more complex than it used to be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The first challenge we faced was how to go about implementing the purchase programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.54,0)">Interventions like this can have any number of unintended consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">First, as a major actor in the markets for public and private bonds, we have to tread carefully.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">We have to make sure that the markets continue to work well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.44,0)">We thus placed limits on the share of a bond issue that we would buy, for instance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.73,0)">This ensures that the Eurosystem does not form a blocking minority in the event of a debt restructuring involving collective action clauses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.14,0)">Second, there is a risk that we might become a drag on market liquidity, in particular in some segments of the corporate bond markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.06,0)">We have thus tried to minimise this kind of side effect, and not to worsen existing shortages of certain assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.39,0)">Third, we must be aware that our actions might distort prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.04,0)">The more bonds we buy and the longer we go on buying them, the greater the risk that prices no longer reflect market conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">These are some of the risks we have to bear in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">Viewed from today, however, it seems that our non-standard measures did have the desired effects on financial markets and, consequently, on the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.95,0)">But what does this mean for the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.14,0)">Let me say clearly that I think this should not happen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">The short-term benefits should not lead us to overlook the long-term costs and the severe side effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">These costs and side effects can be quite high, and they tend to grow over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Thus, a comprehensive asset purchase programme, such as the current one, should only be used to fight a real risk of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.1,0)">In my view, that is the only valid reason for using such tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.47,0)">For one thing, I wonder how it would affect the incentives for various stakeholders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Financial market participants, firms, consumers and also governments have to varying degrees adjusted to historically low interest rates and ample liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">And for some of them, low interest rates have certainly made life easier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">It is therefore crucial to realise that this won’t go on forever – the exit will come eventually – and to adjust accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Second, there is the issue of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">When the central bank buys bonds, it might also fuel asset price bubbles, financed by cheap credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.44,0)">This risk increases the longer unconventional monetary policy measures continue to be applied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.29,0)">And third, monetary policy can only buy time – no matter how loose or unconventional it becomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,151.85,0)">Monetary policy is not a tool meant to alter the long-term viability of economies, and it would be dangerous to believe otherwise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">I will come back to this point in a few minutes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And it’s not just about the tools, it’s also about the target.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">A second idea that is often put forward is that we should change our objective and strive for higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Proponents of this idea claim that we should no longer aim for inflation rates of below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">They argue that we should aim for inflation rates higher than that.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">This idea is based on the observation that higher inflation rates generally lead to higher average nominal interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">This would then give central banks more room for manoeuvre, as they would be less likely to hit the effective lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.84,0)">In my view, aiming for a higher inflation rate would lead to the same problem as making non-standard tools a standard part of the toolbox.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.69,0)">Such proposals tend to underestimate the associated costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.53,0)">There is evidence that changing the objective would be too blunt a move.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.06,0)">Hitting the effective lower bound is costly, but so is higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Research shows that the key benefit of higher inflation – fewer and less severe zero lower bound events – is easily offset by the costs of positive trend inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.24,0)">What are these costs?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Well, price distortions become larger, overall inflation becomes more volatile, and the welfare costs of such volatility increase as well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.77,0)">And changing our objective could undermine the markets’ confidence in the ECB’s commitment to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.87,0)">The transition could prove very hard to manage and could take many years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">And during that time uncertainty would increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.1,0)">We would thus likely witness increased disagreement among forecasters – inflation expectations might become more volatile.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.28,0)">And this is anathema to central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">In the end, it is part of our job description to ensure that long-term inflation expectations are well anchored.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.6,0)">In this context, we must also take into account that changing our objective might in itself hurt our credibility – the main asset of any central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.83,0)">And this would make it much harder to steer inflation expectations even after the new objective had been met.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">After all, people might think that at some point in the future, we could revise our objective again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.32,0)">Central bankers are conservative for a reason.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">To sum up, it seems to me that these proposals have one thing in common.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">They are a reaction to the dramatic shifts we have witnessed since the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.88,0)">Hitting the effective lower bound forced a bout of creativity in the world of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">But I do not believe that the way forward is to entirely revolutionise the way we think about the role of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Still, we should also be realistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.01,0)">The crisis revealed shortcomings in our thinking, and this is something we need to work on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.79,0)">What about financial stability?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.53,0)">So the debate about the future does not end here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Another thing to discuss is how monetary policy and financial stability interact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And this debate also involves our standard tool, the interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.64,0)">Interest rates have been very low for quite some time now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.42,0)">This has coincided with an upsurge in asset prices and a compression of spreads on risky securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.45,0)">Against this backdrop, some economists argue that monetary policy has an effect on both the capacity and the appetite of investors to take on risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.74,0)">This has been termed the risk-taking channel, and it does not play a role in standard monetary policy frameworks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.28,0)">These focus instead on the interest rate, credit or bank lending channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Now, how does this risk-taking channel work?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Well, it can work in different ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.63,0)">For a start, low interest rates mean low returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.51,0)">Investors might rebalance their portfolios and take on more risk in order to make up for lost returns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.79,0)">Should we be concerned about this?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Well, if the process is well managed, there is no need for concern.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.1,0)">However, some financial institutions set rather inflexible target rates of return, for example because investors expect a certain minimum yield.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.44,0)">These inflexible targets may lead them to take on more risk than appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.83,0)">It is clear that this could lead to trouble further down the road.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.16,0)">Also, the financial system’s behaviour can be procyclical.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">There is reliable empirical evidence that loose monetary policy lowers both the measured risk in asset prices and the risk premia demanded by investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.69,0)">But value-at-risk approaches mean that the risk management of banks relies on measured risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">This could then lead to increased leverage, which would add even more liquidity to the global financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">So there is a view that the risk-taking channel should be incorporated into the models that guide monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Let’s try to unpick this argument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.94,0)">In my view, there are two conceptual issues here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.71,0)">The first is the idea that policymakers should only be concerned with risk-taking if it is excessive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.01,0)">But establishing whether or not risk-taking is excessive is quite hard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.64,0)">The second issue is that even if we conclude that there is excessive risk-taking, it is far from clear whether monetary policy would be the best tool to deal with it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let’s start with the first issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.99,0)">What qualifies as excessive risk-taking?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.13,0)">Well, there are two conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.27,0)">Risks would need to be mispriced, and investments would need to have been financed with a dangerous amount of debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.71,0)">If these two conditions are met, a financial crisis becomes more likely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.78,0)">Now, where do we stand on these two issues?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">Well, there is some evidence that banks in the euro area do indeed provide riskier corporate loans when short-term interest rates are low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.44,0)">It seems that banks tend to grant loans with fewer covenants and lower collateral cover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.14,0)">Such loans are riskier in the sense that in case of a default, the impact on the banks might be larger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.57,0)">However, it is hard to tell whether this kind of risk-taking is excessive or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.79,0)">Many studies rely on credit register data which do not include loan interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,185.66,0)">Thus, it is hard to tell whether the loans are mispriced given the risk they contain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">It could just as well be that banks grant loans to riskier companies but do so at higher interest rates, which compensate fairly for the higher loss risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This brings us to the second issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Even if we could say with certainty that risk-taking is excessive, we would still need to be sure that monetary policy is the right tool to deal with it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.71,0)">Some think it is; others think it isn’t.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.99,0)">The latter believe that central banks would run into trouble if they tried to deal with financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,163.4,0)">This is because it would involve a conflict of interest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">To stop a credit-induced bubble, we would need to raise interest rates, and we might need to raise them by a lot.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">After all, potential profits are huge when there is a bubble, so investors would not be deterred by a modest increase in interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.81,0)">But what if a huge increase in interest rates would derail inflation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.56,0)">Which path should monetary policy take in such a situation?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.65,0)">As the economist Jan Tinbergen has observed, you cannot achieve two goals with just one tool.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.34,0)">And attempting to do so would damage the credibility of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.15,0)">It’s not easy to say who is right.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.54,0)">Financial crises are fortunately rare events, and usually there is no single cause.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.09,0)">This means, however, that we do not have a whole lot of data to analyse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.4,0)">Still, in the past, monetary policy was used at least in part to prevent bubbles from forming.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This was done in the United States in the late 1920s, for instance, and in Japan in the late 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,57.47,0)">Suffice to say, these episodes did not end well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">So, it seems wise not to rely on monetary policy when it comes to financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">And in this sense, the reforms of the institutional architecture in the Eurosystem after the crisis were indeed wise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The ECB’s mandate remains clear: our objective is price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">But we have also been given powers for microprudential supervision, as well as some macroprudential competences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">On the microprudential side, European banking supervision contributes to the soundness of the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">A lot of work has already been done, and we will continue to do more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">First of all, banks are much better capitalised and provisioned than they were in 2014, which makes them more resilient to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Second, we are pushing banks to reduce legacy assets such as non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">And third, we are requiring banks to improve their risk management, for instance with regard to the internal models they use to calculate the risks associated with the assets they hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Macroprudential policy was also developed in the aftermath of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">It still needs to be refined and tested.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Available evidence from the euro area and beyond may not be definitive, but it is encouraging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me give you a few examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">With the 2010 Basel III agreement, we introduced countercyclical capital buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">These can help lean against the build-up of imbalances, and if they cannot fully prevent them, they can at least make banks more resilient in the event of a downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Borrower-based tools also look promising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In Asia, they have been used for many years now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">In South Korea, loan-to-value and loan-to-income limits have successfully curbed growth in house prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.92,0)">But again, more systematic evidence is not clear-cut.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.76,0)">Studies based on cross-country evidence show that only loan-to-income limits have had a discernible effect on house prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">But there is still reason to be cautiously optimistic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">And the benefit of macroprudential policy remains clear: it is the most direct way to deal with financial stability concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">And, over time, we will gather more evidence and gain more experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">This will give us plenty of opportunity to fine-tune these new tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Beyond monetary policy: wealth, income and structural reforms But the discussion about the wider effects of monetary policy is not just about financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.27,0)">Particularly here in Germany, there is a fierce debate about who loses out as a result of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.29,0)">Many savers feel that they have to bear a huge burden because interest rates are so low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.85,0)">I understand their frustration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">After all, I am a saver myself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">However, we are not just savers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Some of us might have taken out a loan to buy an apartment or start a business – we benefit from low interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Some of us may have invested in stocks or bonds – we benefit from rising markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">And some of us may have kept our jobs because monetary policy propped up the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.58,0)">Monetary policy affects people in different ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.91,0)">In more technical terms: it has an impact on the distribution of wealth and income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And the important question is whether it makes this distribution more unequal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.07,0)">Does it make the rich richer and the poor poorer?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Let’s look at wealth first.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.17,0)">Here, the most important item for many households is real estate, the home they live in and any other property they may own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Real estate makes up about 80% of the total assets of households, almost irrespective of their level of prosperity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.87,0)">So, to answer our question, we need to think about how monetary policy affects house prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The answer is that quantitative easing raises house prices and, on average, this boosts the net wealth of all households, rich and poor alike.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(179,255,0)">In fact, poorer households might even benefit more because they are more highly leveraged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">So their main asset – their house – gains in value, while the debt they used to finance it becomes cheaper.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.53,0)">Now, what about incomes?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.73,0)">Well, loose monetary policy props up the economy and thus raises employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.34,0)">And again, this should mean that people with lower incomes benefit most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.56,0)">After all, unemployment is much higher among those with low incomes than among those with high incomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.04,0)">So, it seems that loose monetary policy might also reduce income inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">However, there are three things that we must keep in mind.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">First, the effect of monetary policy on inequality is quite small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.81,0)">In the end, inequality is driven by many things such as technological progress, globalisation and taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.01,0)">Compared with these things, monetary policy seems to play a minor role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.55,0)">Second, the effect is temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In the long run, monetary policy is neutral; it does not affect real variables such as output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.08,0)">And third, the effect is symmetric.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.99,0)">Those who benefit when monetary policy is loosened suffer when it is tightened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">We have to be aware of these effects, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">But should it be up to monetary policy to actively engage in redistribution policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Well, monetary policy has a very clear goal: price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">So, I would argue that monetary policy should focus on this goal and leave other goals to other policy areas, and that includes redistribution policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Imagine inflation were sky-high, for a change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.5,0)">Should monetary policy then refrain from raising interest rates because it might alter the distribution of income and wealth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,162.45,0)">Again, there is a clear conflict of interest as one tool would have to achieve two objectives at once.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">That said, the topic of wealth and income distribution is an important one and it should not be taken lightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">I therefore welcome the fact that academia is paying increasing attention to the matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The ECB is contributing to the debate with our household finance and consumption survey.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">And this links to a broader issue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the crisis, monetary policy has played a key role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.02,0)">However, it is not the only game in town – it cannot be the only game, and it should not be.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.2,0)">Monetary policy is not a substitute for other policy areas such as social policy, fiscal policy or labour policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.67,0)">As I and many others have repeatedly said, monetary policy cannot resolve the structural problems of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">All it can do is buy time – at an increasing price.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">So it is time for politics to kick into gear, overcome reform fatigue and do what needs to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">The current conditions are very favourable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The good news is that many countries have come a long way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Ireland was the first success story, and I am glad to be able to add countries such as Spain and Portugal to the list.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">These and other examples show that structural reforms pay off and pave the way for growth to return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But coming back to inequality, there is one thing we must do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">We must ensure that economic growth benefits everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To that end, we should not just rely on redistribution policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is rather about creating equal opportunities for everyone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In this context, education and equal access to it should be at the top of the to-do list of any government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">So, a lot remains to be done, not just on equality but on growth in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">After all, growth also plays a big role in fighting inequality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">And when it comes to long-term growth, research shows that the quality of institutions plays a major role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">At the same time, the quality of institutions differs between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">So, some countries have scope to improve judicial systems, public administration and insolvency regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">This would make their economies more resilient and help them to grow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And I’m not just referring to institutions at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">European institutions are not free of deficiencies either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">They too need to improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">If we want European citizens to trust Europe, we need to make sure we deliver on our promises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.33,0)">And there is a long way to go: according to the latest Eurobarometer survey, only 41% of Europeans tend to trust the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">And the latest election results show that anti-European parties are still on the rise – think of Germany, think of Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">So there is a need for reform and a need to explain thoroughly how the European Union benefits each and every European citizen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, History does not end for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It did not end with the great moderation, and it will not end with the exit from our unconventional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">There are still many questions that need to be answered, some of which I have discussed in my speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But although monetary policy still needs to evolve, it must do so within a certain framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">And this framework is defined by two things.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">First, even though central banks have assumed a key role in the crisis, their objective is very clearly defined: to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Second, to achieve this objective, central banks need to be independent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Within this framework, we need to answer all the questions which remain open.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">So, there is still a lot of work to be done in terms of both theoretical and empirical research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.66,0)">That’s where universities come into play.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">They can help us to gain additional insight, and they can help us to come up with new ideas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">From an academic viewpoint, these are certainly interesting times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Now, history might not end, but you’ll be glad to hear that speeches do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">I have raised a few issues that are currently being discussed in connection with monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">And now I look forward to having a discussion with you on these and any other issues you might want to raise.</span>
