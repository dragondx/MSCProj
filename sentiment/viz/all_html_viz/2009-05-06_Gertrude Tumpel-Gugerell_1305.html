    <span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)"> Ten years of the euro: Successes and challenges in light of the current financial market developments Speech by Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the Hochschule KarlsruheKarlsruhe, 6 May 2009 Introduction When Professor Krämer and I agreed on today’s meeting one year ago, our discussions took place against the backdrop of the first nine months of the financial market turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Central banks had reacted and provided banks with additional funds in the form of reserves, in particular to stabilise the money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Today, one year on, some additional challenges have been added to those we were facing then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">I’m therefore very happy to have the opportunity to be here in Karlsruhe today to talk about the current challenges relating to monetary policy and our experiences during the first ten years of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">It is my pleasure to speak at the Hochschule Karlsruhe, which, since its foundation in 1878 under the name “Großherzogliche Badische Baugewerkeschule”, has, as your website informed me, become the most popular university in Germany with recruiters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the nineteenth century, when the university was still operating under its original name, the official means of payment was the Mark, with Germany having adopted the gold standard in 1873.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Under this currency arrangement, each country set the value of its currency in relation to gold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.61,0)">Coins were made out of gold and banknotes could be exchanged for gold at the central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This also implied that the exchange rate towards other countries participating in the gold standard was fixed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For instance, one US dollar cost 4.20 Mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.09,0)">With the outbreak of the First World War, the gold standard was abandoned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.02,0)">As a consequence, the value of banknotes no longer had a reliable anchor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.76,0)">Hyperinflation occurred in 1922 and 1923, as more and more money was printed to finance public expenditure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Thus, by 1923 one US dollar cost around 4.2 billion Mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.9,0)">Distrust, despair and desolation were the consequences in Germany, thereby undermining fundamental democratic principles and ultimately preparing the ground for the Second World War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">To avoid a repetition of the hyperinflation of the interwar years, the Deutsche Bundesbank was granted a high degree of independence following the Second World War.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.59,0)">Over the 50 years or so of the Deutsche Mark’s existence, annual consumer price inflation averaged 2.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.08,0)">A number of other countries experienced much higher inflation over this period, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.42,0)">Many Germans were therefore sceptical prior to the Deutsche Mark being replaced by the euro ten years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.2,0)">We now know that this scepticism was unfounded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">So, in the first part of my speech, I will briefly describe the euro’s success in its first ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">I will also explore the question of why lasting price stability is important, not only from an economic perspective, but also from a social perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I will then take a look at some of the key challenges we are currently facing and try to draw some initial lessons from the current financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.94,0)">I would also like to consider where we in Europe might be today if we did not have the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">The success of the euro Ten years ago, on 1 January 1999, the euro was introduced as the common currency of 11 Member States of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">This was a unique step following many years of thorough preparation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Now the euro is used by around 330 million citizens in 16 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">It has established itself as a stable currency, accepted in financial markets worldwide.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">Looking at the inflation performance over the first decade of Monetary Union, the ECB has fulfilled its mandate under the Maastricht Treaty, which is to maintain price stability for the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">With inflation averaging slightly more than 2% during this period, the euro area has witnessed a decade of stable prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.82,0)">This contrasts sharply with the fears that prevailed before the introduction of the euro, in particular in Germany, that the euro would be less stable than the Deutsche Mark and that the newly established, supranational ECB would not be in a position to deliver on its promise to keep prices stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">In fact, in its first decade the euro has, on average, been as stable as the Deutsche Mark was in the 1990s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">The euro’s success is even more remarkable if one takes into account the number of price shocks during the past ten years, notably the continuous increase in oil prices between 1999 and mid-2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Over this period crude oil prices rose from around USD 10 per barrel in 1999 to a peak of almost USD 150 per barrel in 2008, and there were also substantial rises in international food prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Likewise, on the domestic side, we have witnessed almost regular increases in indirect taxes and important administered prices in most member countries of the euro area over the first ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">As illustrated by     This means that market participants trust the ECB to continue to deliver on its mandate of maintaining price stability over the medium term, reflecting, in particular, the smooth functioning and the credibility of the ECB’s monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Firm anchoring of inflation expectations is essential for solid economic growth, job creation and the cultivation of trust regarding asset formation and savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.79,0)">Low rates of inflation, together with well-anchored inflation expectations, have resulted in nominal and real interest rates across the euro area that have been low by both historical and international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Low interest rates and the associated low borrowing costs have had positive effects on investment and employment in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Such a favourable outcome in terms of price stability, the credibility of monetary policy and institutional robustness had not been expected by many critics of the euro prior to the creation of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.09,0)">In particular, it was constantly argued that the ECB’s single monetary policy could cause problems because a uniform approach in the form of a single monetary policy would not do justice to all the countries of the euro area, given the existing economic and structural differences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,105.12,0)">They argued that it would be too restrictive for countries with low levels of growth and too loose for countries with high levels of growth, and counterproductive in any case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.79,0)">It was also argued that national fiscal policies would be incompatible with the single monetary policy conducted by a supranational central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Finally, from an institutional point of view, there were doubts whether the presidents and national central bank governors in the Governing Council of the ECB would be able to act in a truly European spirit, rather than in the national interests of their respective countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">But, ten years on, measured against the achievements in terms of monetary policy, credibility and price stability, there is widespread agreement that the euro has performed very well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.52,0)">In fact, none of the above-mentioned fears have materialised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">This is tangible proof of the robustness of the Eurosystem  , and of the fact that the ECB’s monetary policy decisions are based on shared values and common principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.65,0)">The Austrian economist Joseph A. Schumpeter stated that “a nation’s monetary system is a reflection of everything that the nation wants, suffers, and is.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">… Nothing says what a nation is made of so clearly as what it does in terms of its monetary policy.” Allow me, therefore, to briefly explain why it is so important to maintain price stability over the medium term and then I will present the main benefits of lasting price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">First of all, price stability fosters trust in money and in property rights more generally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In particular, it preserves the purchasing power of money and protects the real value of income and wealth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.63,0)">Price stability is also important for the weakest groups in society, who suffer most from high and volatile inflation rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">As a consequence, maintaining price stability also contributes to social cohesion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Price stability is a precondition for sustainable growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Prices can generally be seen as the traffic lights of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">A higher price is a signal for the producer of a good to continue or increase production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">It signals a change in the relative scarcity of the individual good, compared with other goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.49,0)">Similarly, a low price tells the producer to reduce or halt production.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.87,0)">Without price stability, however, prices lose their signalling function, as it is no longer clear whether a change in price is due to a change in the relative scarcity of the individual good or caused by a change in the general price level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.02,0)">With high, volatile inflation, it becomes more difficult to distinguish between the two causes and it is more complicated for producers to know whether they should increase production or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.0,0)">Furthermore, price stability over the medium term reduces risk for investors, which contributes to lower interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This makes investment projects more profitable, which again leads to higher levels of employment and economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">The past decade is also testament to the fact that price stability goes hand in hand with economic growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In the first ten years of Europe’s single currency, the number of people employed in the euro area has risen by approximately 18 million, which is equivalent to an annual increase of nearly 1.3%  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">This compares favourably with the 1990s, when fewer than 8 million jobs were created, corresponding to an average annual increase over this period of 0.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.38,0)">Price stability was of course not solely responsible for this; changes in employment patterns are affected by many factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">However, these developments strongly confirm that a monetary policy oriented towards price stability is fully compatible with job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Price stability helps to ensure that necessary corporate restructuring does not get left on the backburner and also fosters wage differentiation across sectors, regions and qualifications, with positive effects on economic growth and employment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">At the same time, the euro has made an important contribution to economic and financial integration within Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The single currency has enhanced our ability to take advantage of the single market, and trade and capital ties between euro area countries have grown significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">For example, cross-border trade in goods and services in the euro area has increased by 10 percentage points as a share of GDP since the introduction of the single currency  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Trade between individual euro area countries now accounts for about half of their total imports and exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">At the same time, trade with countries outside the euro area has also developed very dynamically.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">The euro has promoted competition, price transparency and price convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">It has lowered transaction costs and eliminated exchange rate risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">The euro has boosted direct investment within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Mergers and acquisitions in the euro area have also risen noticeably.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">In addition, the euro has made a significant contribution to the integration of financial markets in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">One example of this is the marked increase in cross-border investment in securities within the euro area, as illustrated by   The key challenges arising from the current financial market turbulence Let me now turn to the ongoing financial market turbulence and its implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Since August 2007 the global financial markets have experienced extensive corrective realignments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.87,0)">The repercussions of the turbulence were initially visible in the financial market in the form of dramatic increases in risk premia and increased volatility in interest rate movements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.71,0)">Thereafter, upheaval on the financial market led to a severe and synchronised economic downturn across the globe, the deepest since the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.71,0)">The current crisis, therefore, poses grave challenges to the financial industry and central bank community, as well as to supervisory and regulatory authorities and national governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,192.29,0)">The outbreak of the financial market turbulence was not entirely unexpected, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.88,0)">Both the ECB and other institutions had warned of macroeconomic imbalances and systematic undervaluation of risks in the years leading up to the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Those years were characterised by an extended period of low interest rates, low inflation and sustained economic growth, both globally and within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">At the same time, liquidity was abundant and default risks were considered by many to be very low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This environment strengthened investors’ risk appetite.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In particular, with financial market participants expecting this environment to continue for quite some time, risks were systematically underestimated and the search for ever higher yields intensified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">As a result, commercial banks readily granted credit for house purchases to households that otherwise could not have afforded it, and without adequately assessing their creditworthiness or credit default risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">At the same time, in an attempt to achieve higher yields, a number of innovative and increasingly complex financial products were offered, particularly in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">One prominent example of this was the bundling of mortgages in new and highly complex financial products and their resale as new securities to third parties via global financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Bundling mortgages and distributing them was supposed to spread the overall risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.98,0)">But this did not work as it was intended to.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">On the contrary, as the risk was ultimately transferred to a third party, the relevant incentives were not in place for the loan providers to make sure that the borrowers would be able to repay those loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.01,0)">At the same time, many of those that ended up bearing the risk underestimated the extent of that risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">It eventually became evident that this practice was viable only as long as house prices in the United States continued to increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.82,0)">When the many years of increases in house prices came to an end and house prices started to fall, problems soon emerged, including in the euro area, as banks here were among the buyers of these securities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.69,0)">Investors suddenly began to doubt the quality of their assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.76,0)">This led to a sharp correction in prices on the financial markets, accompanied by a withdrawal of funds from the markets, leading to corresponding liquidity shortages for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.67,0)">Problems first emerged at the short end of the money market, where banks borrow from and lend to each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.19,0)">Normally, the rates in this segment of the money market are close to the key interest rates set by central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.79,0)">This reflects the fact that banks became unwilling to lend to each other because they feared that the other bank would not be able to repay the loan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In order to obtain a loan, banks had to pay higher interest rates to compensate for the increased risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">You can also see that the spread widened dramatically in September last year in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.15,0)">However, the spread has declined significantly in recent months, although it is still far above the levels that prevailed prior to the financial market turbulence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.93,0)">The banking sector has been facing significant challenges since financial market tensions intensified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.57,0)">For instance, the declared cumulative write-downs and credit market losses of European banks amount to almost USD 360 billion so far, or about EUR 270 billion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.27,0)">These problems have played a decisive role in the subdued lending to companies and households in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.01,0)">This is, on the one hand, due to the cutback in debt capital positions on banks’ balance sheets and the general tightening of credit standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.34,0)">On the other hand, the demand for loans has fallen as a result of the overall weakening of economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Developments in borrowing and lending have an impact on the real economy in that they play a particularly decisive role in trends in investment activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Response to the crisis From the very beginning of the crisis, the ECB has acted in a decisive and appropriate manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">It has taken a number of measures unprecedented in nature, scope and timing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">The ECB has provided an extremely large amount of liquidity support to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In fact, when tensions first emerged in August 2007 the ECB was the first central bank worldwide to respond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">By making changes to its operational framework, the ECB made sure that all solvent banks would have sufficient access to funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">When the crisis intensified in September last year, we introduced a number of new measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Most importantly, we provided banks with unlimited access to liquidity at fixed rates for up to six months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(133,255,0)">The ECB also expanded its list of assets eligible for use as collateral in the Eurosystem’s credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">As a result of these new measures, the size of the Eurosystem’s balance sheet has expanded by a substantial EUR 600 billion and now stands at 16% of GDP, compared with 10% in mid-2007, with some volatility over that period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">This mainly reflects the expansion of the provision of liquidity to the banking system, which plays a crucial role in the funding of the euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">In other major economic regions, funding via debt securities, which has suffered more severe disruption, is of greater importance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In this respect, all the unconventional liquidity measures taken by the ECB have been tailored to the needs of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Notably, they have eased banks’ balance sheet constraints and thereby certainly helped to avoid a sudden collapse in the supply of credit and the emergence of a systemic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">In line with the substantial weakening of global demand and economic activity, inflationary pressures and risks have been diminishing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.68,0)">As a result, the ECB’s policy rates have been cut by 3 percentage points since the intensification of the crisis last October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.62,0)">These rate reductions, together with the liquidity management measures, have had a significant impact on money market interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.15,0)">Since last October overnight money market rates have fallen even more steeply than the ECB’s policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.93,0)">Money market rates in the euro area have now reached very low levels by international standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.79,0)">Lower money market rates have also led to lower interest rates for private households and firms, although the decline in money market rates has so far been greater than the decline in interest rates on credit for households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The fiscal authorities in the euro area have also demonstrated their capacity to react rapidly to exceptional circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">In a coordinated effort, the national governments of the euro area have provided support to the banking system, most notably through recapitalisation and guarantees for liabilities and assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The funds provided under the package announced to stabilise the financial sector through these types of measure amount to 23% of the euro area’s GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">The overall fiscal stimulus – through discretionary policy measures and the effect of automatic stabilisers – amounts to 3.6 percentage points of GDP for 2009 and 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">All of these measures were necessary to support the functioning of the financial system, but they also imply a considerable fiscal burden in that fiscal debt and deficit ratios may increase substantially.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(141,255,0)">In fact, what matters is not only the size of the fiscal stimulus, but also the potential to enhance confidence and effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">While the fiscal measures introduced by euro area governments during the crisis have succeeded in cushioning the adverse impact of the crisis on the economy, it remains essential that countries return to sound fiscal policies and thereby, in a credible manner, stick to their commitment to respect the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Overall, during the ongoing financial market turbulence, the euro area and the EU as a whole have proved their capacity to act decisively and promptly under difficult circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">National measures have been coordinated in a pragmatic manner with a view to enhancing their effectiveness through mutual reinforcement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Lessons from the crisis The current financial crisis has pointed to a number of weaknesses that need to be addressed if we are to avoid a similar crisis in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.02,0)">Some weaknesses are rooted in the current design of the international financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.86,0)">This is particularly true with regard to the lack of transparency and accountability within the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In this respect, much relies on financial players themselves taking responsibility for evaluating risk more effectively and increasing transparency as regards risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">In addition, various initiatives at national, European and international level aim, in particular, to improve the robustness of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Two recent reports – the Turner Report, written by Lord Turner, Chairman of the British Financial Services Authority, and a report by a high-ranking group of experts on financial supervision, led by Jacques de Larosière, former Governor of the Banque de France and former Managing Director of the IMF – contain a range of valuable reform recommendations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In addition, a group of experts recently provided a fitting analysis of the shortcomings of the current financial system in a report on the future of the banking sector in the Netherlands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">I would like to highlight three areas where I think change is necessary: there needs to be an increase in transparency, a dampening of pro-cyclicality and an improvement in institutional design in the field of financial supervision and regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">First, the financial sector needs to become more transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">It is quite striking that, despite the regulatory advances and the progress of information technology in recent decades, some financial market segments have been characterised by products that have proven to be hard for investors – never mind rating agencies, supervisors and regulators – to understand and value.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">One possibility here would be to standardise products and transactions and to ensure that transactions take place via regulated exchanges or clearing houses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Furthermore, all systemically important institutions, markets and instruments should be subject to an appropriate degree of regulation and oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.28,0)">One such example is the market for derivatives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For most of these financial contracts, the conditions are agreed upon between the two parties and the instruments are traded “over the counter".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.0,0)">Trading activities on this “OTC derivatives market” are subject to much less regulation than those on markets for products traded on the stock exchange, and the post-trading infrastructure is also less developed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Given the systemic relevance of these markets, the ECB supports the swift development of improved post-trading infrastructures, so as to enable more effective management of credit and operational risk, as well as to improve the transparency of these markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Second, in my view, we need to try to dampen the excessive pro-cyclicality of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">By this I mean that it typically becomes much easier to acquire funding during booms, whereas credit standards are normally tightened during economic downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.39,0)">In the same vein, investment risks are typically systematically underestimated in good times, whereas they tend to be overestimated in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">In this way, the financial system stimulates the booms and exacerbates economic downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.07,0)">This is exactly what we have been witnessing in the course of the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Ideally, we would want a financial system that worked the other way around, thus dampening booms and providing a stimulus for stabilisation during economic downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Some first steps have already been taken towards counteracting the pro-cyclical effects of supervisory regulations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Discussions are currently underway regarding changes to equity capital regulations and reporting in the area of risk provision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In addition, the introduction of a borrowing limit or leverage ratio is being considered.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">These measures all aim to reduce pro-cyclicality in the financial system and improve its stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">A third lesson we can draw from the current crisis is that it is necessary to take a more system-wide approach to financial market regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">It is not enough to ensure that individual financial institutions are solid.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Greater emphasis must be placed on the stability of the financial system as a whole – not least the cross-border links between the various components of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">The de Larosière group proposed giving the ECB more responsibility within this field   by establishing a European Systemic Risk Council under the auspices of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">The main tasks of this new Council would be to pool and analyse information, monitor relevant developments, make recommendations on macro-prudential policy and issue risk warnings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">The ECB welcomes this proposal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The establishment of a European Systemic Risk Council should substantially improve the assessment of risks to financial stability at the EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">In order for the new Council to perform its tasks in an optimal manner, three requirements must be fulfilled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">First, the ECB must have timely access to the relevant information, including information concerning individual institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Second, risk warnings from the new Council should be translated into effective policy action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">And third, for the new Council to be independent and effective in its decision-making, it is essential that it have a solid institutional and legal basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">I also think the current crisis holds some lessons for monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The crisis has shown us that a stable financial system is a prerequisite for price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">Everyone is agreed that each central bank has one instrument at its disposal, namely monetary policy, to achieve its goal of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.29,0)">However, not all are agreed on which prices a central bank should be concerned about.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.9,0)">The extent to which monetary policy should take asset prices into account has been a long-standing debate among central bankers and academic economists.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The ECB’s definition of price stability identifies a specific price index – namely the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   – as the one to be used for assessing whether price stability has been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.41,0)">As the HICP is a consumer price index, asset prices such as house prices or stock prices are not included.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.78,0)">This does not mean that asset prices are not important from a monetary policy perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To the extent that changes in asset prices have an impact on the outlook for prices, a central bank that aims to maintain price stability will need to respond to these changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">One could argue that asset prices should play a greater role in monetary policy considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">According to this school of thought, as the build-up of an asset price bubble might have severe economic consequences in the longer term, central banks should try to deal with the bubble pre-emptively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">To put this in more concrete terms, it is argued that the central bank should increase interest rates when asset price inflation reaches a certain level, even if the impact of this inflation on the outlook for consumer prices is not obvious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In academic literature, this approach is often referred to as “leaning against the wind”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.97,0)">Taking asset prices into account may pose problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">However, monetary policy-makers should try to mitigate the risk of the build-up of a bubble by being aware of the effects their policy decisions can have on the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">The ECB’s assessment of risks to price stability is based on a comprehensive economic and monetary analysis, known as its “two-pillar strategy”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The first pillar, economic analysis, is common to most central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">It basically consists of identifying risks to price stability in the short to medium term by analysing the interplay between aggregate supply and aggregate demand in the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The analysis includes the study of the interaction between a number of macroeconomic and financial variables.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.11,0)">The variables we look at include, just to name a few, aggregate output, private consumption, investment, fiscal policy, capital and labour market conditions, different price and cost indicators, the exchange rate, the global economy, the balance of payments and financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The second pillar, monetary analysis, is given a prominent role at the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Analysing developments in borrowing and lending, particularly loans to the private sector, is helpful in extracting the relevant signals from monetary developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">This analysis also fosters the regular monitoring of asset price developments and their implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Consideration of these aspects must become more extensive and systematic in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">Strengthening the ECB’s role in financial supervision should contribute to ensuring that proper consideration is given to the possible build-up of financial imbalances when making monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.73,0)">The current crisis has demonstrated that risks to financial stability are accompanied by risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Central banks must give even greater consideration to these risks in their analyses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.83,0)">The benefits of the euro in the current crisis As mentioned, the euro was very succesful in its first ten years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.14,0)">But it is clear that the current economic crisis represents the greatest challenge for the euro so far.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.87,0)">Let’s be realistic: 2009 will be a difficult year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.04,0)">According to the most recent macroeconomic projections by ECB staff, published in March of this year, the euro area economy is expected to contract by between 2.2% and 3.2% in 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.06,0)">Since then, other international institutions have published even more pessimistic forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.62,0)">According to the forecast by the European Commission, for example, the economy is expected to shrink by 4% this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.78,0)">This means, among other things, fewer jobs, higher unemployment, less investment and fewer exports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">2009 will be a year of necessary adjustments for banks, firms and private households, but these adjustments will lay the foundations for a return to more stable and improved economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">That said, we should not forget how Europe would look today without the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.68,0)">In addition to the financial market turbulence, the problems in the financial sector and the economic downturn, we would be facing potentially large fluctuations between Europe’s national currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,200.69,0)">The currencies of some of the countries outside the euro area have experienced considerable fluctuations during the current crisis, as illustrated in   This is an additional source of uncertainty for these countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">The current turmoil has also confirmed an advantage the euro has, namely that, in stormy seas, it is better to be aboard a large ship than a small boat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">The euro has had a very important stabilising effect in difficult times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">The many benefits of the euro under the current circumstances are also highlighted by the fact that many central and eastern European countries have expressed a wish to join the euro area as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">This is no surprise, given that many countries have already made progress towards adopting the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Nevertheless, all countries must first fulfil all of the relevant criteria before they may join the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.13,0)">I would like to emphasise that the euro area is not a closed shop.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Five new countries have joined since the start of Monetary Union in January 1999, with Slovakia becoming the newest member of the euro area in January of this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">The door is open to all those that meet the clearly stated and predefined criteria for membership of the Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Conclusion As the saying goes, “the proof of the pudding is in the eating”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The last ten years are evidence of the fact that the euro has made a significant contribution to a stronger and more integrated Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">The single currency has created an environment where price stability is king.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">The euro has also proved itself in the current financial market crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Thanks to the broad availability of euro liquidity, the currency has facilitated the stabilisation of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.83,0)">The financial crisis has posed huge challenges for financial market participants, governments and central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">In order to be able to deal with these better in the future, we must pay particular attention to three lessons learnt from the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">First, we need to pay more attention to considerations regarding financial stability and systemic risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">This is also essential in the overall assessment of the risks to price stability over the medium term and in respect of the ECB’s conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The ECB’s involvement in macro-prudential supervision within the proposed European Systemic Risk Council will be a welcome step in this direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.49,0)">Second, pro-cyclicality within the financial system must be restricted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">In this regard, it will be crucial to come up with appropriate regulatory tools to effectively smooth out business cycle fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Third, there must be an improvement in regulation and oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In this respect, all systemically important institutions, markets and instruments should be subject to an appropriate degree of regulation and oversight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">For example, the ECB supports initiatives to swiftly establish infrastructures for systemically relevant markets such as the OTC derivatives markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">The biggest challenge we now face is the need to reform the financial sector in a way which benefits the real economy, pulls us quickly out of the crisis and combats potential risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Over the last ten years we have been successful in achieving the last of these things and we intend this to continue in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Advisory Committee on the Future of Banks in the Netherlands  : Restoring trust.</span>
