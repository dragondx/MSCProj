    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.35,0)"> Global financial regulation: where next?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(150,255,0)">Pending tasks for regulators and macroprudential policy makers Speech by Luis de Guindos, Vice-President of the ECB, London City Week, London, 21 May 2019 Introduction More than ten years have passed since the global financial crisis triggered a comprehensive regulatory reform process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Many important measures have been put in place since then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The title of the next panel discussion therefore raises a very pertinent question for global regulators: where next?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.65,0)">Should regulators take a long break, as some stakeholders might quietly hope?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.25,0)">Or is there still work to be done?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.89,0)">As you might imagine, I tend towards the view that it is not the time for regulators to rest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In my remarks today, I will touch upon three areas that require further efforts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">First, for the banking sector, we need to ensure the full and timely implementation of Basel III standards and a proper evaluation of the effects of the reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Second, macroprudential policy based on robust quantitative assessments should play a crucial role in sustaining the resilience of the financial sector over the financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Third, we need to see active monitoring of the non-bank financial sector, including from a system-wide perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">This is because of the growing size and risk-taking activity of non-banks which may call for macroprudential powers and tools in this area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Evaluating the effects of reform and implementing the Basel III package Let me start with reform implementation and assessment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">As the post-crisis reform agenda for the banking sector is now coming to an end, focus is gradually shifting towards evaluating the effects of the reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Such evaluation work is an essential part of the policy process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">It helps us to understand whether the reforms are having the desired effect, and to identify potential unintended consequences that may have to be addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(89,255,0)">For these reasons, we fully support the evaluation work being carried out under the aegis of the Financial Stability Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">We are also conducting a number of evaluation projects of our own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">One recent study by ECB staff, for example, finds that the reforms that are already in place have helped to make the euro area banking system safer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">In particular, risks have been considerably reduced, and euro area banks are now better able to withstand shocks of the kind we have experienced in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">On the one hand, this is a reassuring result, illustrating the progress we have made over the last few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.56,0)">On the other hand, these results should not make us complacent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">We need to keep up our efforts and strive for the full, timely and consistent implementation of those elements of the reforms that are still missing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For the EU, these include, in particular, the Fundamental Review of the Trading Book and the Basel III finalisation package of December 2017.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.72,0)">The latter includes the so-called output floor, which limits the capital benefit a bank can gain from relying on internal models rather than on the standardised approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.04,0)">Some argue that these and other reform elements are not well-suited to the European market, and that they would have a disproportionate impact on EU banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Nevertheless, while the reforms will require adjustment by some firms, the transition period – in particular for the output floor – will help to smooth the transition and make the impact manageable for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Overall, I am deeply convinced that the reforms are necessary to restore confidence in the banking sector and will lead to a better prudential framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">It is thus essential that the entire Basel III package is implemented faithfully and consistently so that we can maintain a level-playing field at global level and ensure that the G20 framework delivers on its objectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Macroprudential policy and a macroprudential dimension to stress tests of the banking sector The implementation of these reforms will mark the end of a long journey since the global financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Attention will shift towards ensuring the resilience of the banking sector over the financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Our macroprudential policy framework and related quantitative assessments, providing a macroprudential dimension to stress tests of the banking sector, will be cornerstones of this process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Let me say a few words about our policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Macroprudential powers were conferred on the ECB in 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The ECB shares responsibility for macroprudential policy in the euro area with the national authorities who actually implement macroprudential measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.66,0)">The ECB is notified of hundreds of national measures each year and the ECB’s Governing Council may then raise objections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.16,0)">The ECB can also tighten, or “top up”, should measures be deemed insufficient, provided that these refer to instruments covered in European legislation – the Capital Requirements Directive and the Capital Requirements Regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The combined macroprudential buffer requirements in the euro area currently range between 2.5%- to 5.75% depending on the country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.56,0)">Banks directly supervised by the ECB fall in the categories of globally systemically important institutions   or other systemically important institutions   and are thereby subject to the respective capital buffers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">Four countries   have activated the systemic risk buffer, while two have activated the countercyclical capital buffer with a further three announcing positive countercyclical capital buffer rates for the near future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Looking ahead, macroprudential policy should play an important role in ensuring the resilience of the banking sector to adverse shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">At this stage of the financial cycle, is would still be desirable for a number of euro area countries to build-up macroprudential buffers, in my view.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The crisis taught us that we must be vigilant in safeguarding the resilience of our financial system at times when vulnerabilities are building up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.11,0)">The slower growth momentum we are seeing increases the risk of tail events, in other words, shocks that are unlikely to occur, but would have a significant impact on the financial system and the economy if they did.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">Bank capital plays a crucial role in absorbing these tail risks: it provides solvency insurance and makes it more likely that banks will be able to continue to provide credit during a downturn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">From a macroprudential perspective, then, the continued build-up of buffers could therefore be justified, especially in those countries where the long upturn may have led to an underestimation of credit risk or where private indebtedness is particularly high or rising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Ensuring that buffers are adequate is not just a task for regulators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is in the interest of banks too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">It contributes to restore confidence in the sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Improving bank profitability in a sustainable way, for example by adjusting business models, would help banks improve their capital generation capacity while also making it easier for them to raise capital externally when needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">This brings me to the concept of macroprudential stress testing, a key analytical tool that helps us assess the resilience of the financial system over the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.69,0)">Unlike regular supervisory stress testing, it accounts for banks’ reaction to adverse circumstances and its impact on the real economy that may further stress banks’ operating environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">As such, it can provide a more complete picture of banks’ performance and capital needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">It can therefore lead to more realistic results for policy use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The ECB’s macroprudential stress test framework not only tracks the resilience of individual banking institutions but also accounts for how banks interact with each other and how their actions feed back to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.83,0)">It internalises the fact that banks may deleverage in response to negative developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,75.98,0)">It subsequently, takes into account the extent to which this adverse credit supply shock may aggravate the downturn leading to a further deterioration in banks’ balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This framework complements the EU-wide stress testing exercises conducted under the aegis of the European Banking Authority  , which are mainly of a micro-prudential nature.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">A macroprudential exercise conducted in 2018 for banks directly supervised by the ECB  using the baseline and adverse scenarios of the recent EBA stress test, confirmed the general resilience of the euro area banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.89,0)">Bank deleveraging and feedback to the real economy would however lead to a substantial drop in lending to the non-financial private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.07,0)">This would lead to an additional fall in GDP of 1.6% across the euro area, on top of the original GDP shocks in the adverse scenario over the three-year horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">This analytical framework can also help us to calibrate macroprudential policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The framework shows, for instance, that the timing of the activation of capital-based measures matters for their effectiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">If a new policy tool is introduced in good times, banks are able to build up additional capital by retaining their profits, and they do not need to shrink their loan books to improve their capital ratios.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.06,0)">A new capital policy tool that is introduced in bad times however is likely to trigger a reduction in credit and place an additional drag on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.85,0)">Bad timing increases the cost of macroprudential and regulatory interventions, potentially rendering such measures counter-productive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Risks and macroprudential policy for the non-bank financial sector Let me now turn to the non-bank financial sector which is becoming ever more important for our financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In my view, work on the regulatory and, in particular, the macroprudential framework for this sector is still in its early stages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The share of market-based financing is likely to continue growing, not least in view of the efforts made in the context of the capital markets union, which will have tangible benefits for the euro area economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">More integrated and deeper European capital markets will promote a more diversified funding base for the European corporate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">This, in turn, will help firms weather a possible shock to the banking sector and a resulting decline in the supply of bank credit, as they would be able to draw on other – market-based – funding sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">But this can only happen if market-based finance remains resilient in the face of such a shock.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.54,0)">The benefits of a growing non-bank financial sector are currently accompanied by potential vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.17,0)">In search of higher yields, non-banks have accumulated more credit and liquidity risks on their balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.5,0)">This renders them more vulnerable to the low credit quality and high indebtedness in some segments of the corporate and government sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">Moreover, non-banks may be contributing to the current cyclical underpricing of risk and helping to amplify the upswing in the wider financial cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This is partly because non-banks are subject to lighter regulatory constraints which in some cases allow them to take on more risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.19,0)">If risks were to unwind in a disorderly manner we could see funding flows dry-up and funding conditions in the real economy affected more broadly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">If we were to reap the benefits of a deep and integrated European capital market, then, non-bank financing needs to develop in a sustainable manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">In this changing environment, it is important to strengthen our risk identification and monitoring framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">International cooperation is needed to develop tools for stress testing but now at system-wide level, in the form of models that incorporate both banks and non-banks, consider feedback and amplification from the interaction between sectors and look for tipping points and non-linear responses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">From a regulatory perspective, at least two lines of defence are needed to counter evolving risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">First and foremost, prudential standards must remain solid in the non-bank financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.87,0)">But this alone will not be sufficient if risks evolve more broadly and across institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">An extension of the macroprudential toolkit to the non-bank financial sector is needed, thereby providing the authorities with the means to address risks at the system level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">While the macroprudential framework for banks is relatively well developed and gives authorities tools with which to address cyclical and structural systemic risks, the framework for non-banks is still in its infancy and needs further development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">Such a framework would need to be capable of identifying and addressing the key fragilities and externalities stemming from the non-bank sector, and provide authorities with the tools that would allow them to achieve this in an efficient and effective manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.16,0)">Concluding remarks Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">The regulatory community has been striving to establish a framework that makes our financial system more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">While much has been achieved, I do not believe that we can now rest on our laurels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">On the contrary, in particular the three remaining tasks outlined today require our continued effort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">The Basel III package for the banking sector should be implemented in a timely and consistently manner across jurisdictions thereby ensuring that a level-playing field is preserved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">As attention shifts towards maintaining the resilience of the banking system over the financial cycle, macroprudential policy and related quantitative assessments become prominent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Adding a macroprudential dimension to stress tests of the banking sector is essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Finally, developments in the non-bank financial sector call for an active monitoring and the extension of the macroprudential policy toolkit to this sector.</span>
