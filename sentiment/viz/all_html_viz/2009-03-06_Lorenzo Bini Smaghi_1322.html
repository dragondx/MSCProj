    <span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)"> Three questions on monetary policy easing Lecture by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBat the University of AnconaAncona, 6 March 2009 Introduction   It is a pleasure to be at the University of Ancona and to be able to deliver this lecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Thank you very much for the invitation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.17,0)">When preparing this lecture, I found myself thinking about the speech I gave in October 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">At that time, central banks worldwide were raising interest rates, so I thought it would be useful to consider the key challenges that monetary policy faced in a tightening phase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.06,0)">I asked the following three questions: When to start tightening monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.14,0)">At what speed to tighten?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.02,0)">And when to stop tightening?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.12,0)">Circumstances have changed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.43,0)">Now, central banks worldwide are lowering interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.95,0)">So we could ask the same questions, but just change one word: When to start easing monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.23,0)">At what speed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.62,0)">And when to stop easing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Today I would like to share with you some thoughts on these three questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">In theory, the answers to the three questions should be simple.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.56,0)">A loosening phase begins – and the interest rate should be cut – when downward risks to inflation prevail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.22,0)">The interest rate should be cut at a pace necessary to ensure price stability in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Finally, the easing phase should end when upward risks to inflation become dominant again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,197.17,0)">In the euro area, the downward or upward risks to inflation refer to the ECB’s definition of price stability, which is less than, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">This may sound easy, in theory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.29,0)">In practice, how do you decide if upward or downward risks to inflation predominate?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.73,0)">There is no silver bullet, no single indicator and no single model that can do the job for monetary policy-makers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Any modern central bank looks at a variety of indicators, at a variety of models, and uses careful judgement to reach a firm view concerning risks to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">At the ECB, as you know, we find it useful to organise the analysis of risks to price stability on the basis of two complementary perspectives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">First, in what we call the “economic analysis”, we assess the short to medium-term determinants of price developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.95,0)">The focus is on real activity, price indexes and financial conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The second perspective, the “monetary analysis”, focuses on the medium to long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Here we explore the medium to long-run link between monetary and financial variables and inflationary pressures in order to cross-check the economic analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">We employ this two-pillar strategy when forming a view on whether upward risks or downward risks to price stability predominate; and when forming a view on whether the interest rate should move.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Regardless of the phase, the analytical process remains essentially the same – at the beginning of the loosening phase or in the middle of it or even when we are about to decide to begin raising the interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We adhere to the same principles whenever we make an interest rate decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">We do so because we believe that monetary policy is about a continuous commitment to price stability over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.13,0)">Forward-looking monetary policy Let me start by recalling why the conduct of monetary policy is more complicated in practice than it may seem in theory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.52,0)">The key factor relates to the transmission lags of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.94,0)">It is the time that it takes for changes in the interest rate to have an impact on other economic variables, in particular inflation, which amounts to several months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">That the transmission lags of monetary policy are significant is one of the best-known, most robust findings of monetary economics.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It is a finding supported by evidence from different countries, from different monetary regimes, and is based on alternative empirical methodologies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.98,0)">Milton Friedman used perhaps the simplest methodology to suggest that the transmission lags of monetary policy are significant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.62,0)">In a paper published in 1972, he considered correlations between changes in monetary aggregates and changes in industrial production and in consumer prices indexes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">He did so for a range of leads and lags, using data from the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Friedman’s main finding was that the highest correlation for industrial production was for the monetary aggregate M1 leading by three months and for M2 leading by six months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Furthermore, the highest correlation for consumer prices was for M1 leading by 20 months and for M2 leading by 23 months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Friedman reported this evidence almost 40 years ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">It is remarkable that recent evidence confirms his findings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.92,0)">In the United States and in the United Kingdom, there is a lag of one to two years between changes in monetary aggregates and changes in inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In the euro area, the low-frequency component of M3 growth leads the low-frequency component of HICP inflation by about two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Techniques more sophisticated than Friedman’s also suggest that changes in the interest rate have the strongest impact on the economy with a delay.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.45,0)">I refer here to structural vector autoregression models, VAR models, and to dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models, DSGE models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">The results from structural VARs for the euro area are in line with the findings based on data from the United States and elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.08,0)">Peersman and Smets, in a volume devoted to the transmission of monetary policy in the euro area,   find that an increase in the interest rate is followed by a fall in output after about two quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.18,0)">The effect on output is strongest after about three to five quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.77,0)">The price level responds even more sluggishly than output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.97,0)">Furthermore, it appears that the price level responds more slowly in the euro area compared with the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.68,0)">This is something you would expect, given that prices of individual goods and services appear to change less frequently in the euro area compared with those in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">DSGE models estimated from euro area data arrive at results broadly in line with those from structural VAR models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.09,0)">For example, the model by Smets and Wouters shows hump-shaped responses of output and inflation to a change in the interest rate, with the strongest effects occurring with a delay similar to that found in VAR studies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.95,0)">The lags between changes in the interest rate and their impact on the economy appear to remain approximately constant over time and across different monetary policy regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.61,0)">For the euro area, Peersman and Smets find that they cannot reject the null hypothesis, namely that, since the early 1970s, the response of the economy to monetary policy has remained unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.53,0)">It might be possible that Economic and Monetary Union   has caused changes in the transmission mechanism and that such changes are too recent to be detected in statistical analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">All we can say so far is that the available evidence points towards the absence of significant changes in the transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">For example, a recent paper by Boivin, Giannoni and Mojon reports no significant changes in the transmission of monetary policy to inflation since January 1999.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">To sum up, given the lags in the transmission of its effects, monetary policy has to be forward-looking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A central bank has to try to forecast as well as it can developments in the economy over the so-called “policy-relevant horizon”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">It also has to try to detect the risks to price stability and decide the appropriate level of interest rate to achieve its objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.28,0)">When to start monetary easing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.51,0)">On the basis of the analytical framework described above, any loosening of monetary policy should in theory start before the cyclical downturn; it must start before economic activity falls below its potential level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">But to start the loosening cycle inflation expectations need to be firmly anchored, in line with the central bank’s definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.62,0)">If interest rates are reduced in a context of rising inflation expectations, there is a risk of dis-anchoring them which would jeopardise the effectiveness of the policy move.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.74,0)">This refers to expectations prevailing not only in the financial markets but also in the goods and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.28,0)">In the financial markets, an increase in inflation expectations would lead to a higher long-term interest rate, possibly also in real terms, which would discourage investment – precisely what the monetary easing did not intend to achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.57,0)">In the goods market, if a cut in the interest rate were made while producers’ pricing expectations remained high, or were even increasing, it would further encourage mispricing behaviour in the face of a slowdown and would in fact exacerbate it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.64,0)">In the labour market, if wage behaviour were based on excessive inflation expectations, a rate cut could justify such expectations and excessive increases in remunerations, which would be a development out of line with the growth slowdown ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Therefore, the timing of any policy easing has to be linked to inflation expectations, in particular longer-term ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.08,0)">A central banker has to extract information from a series of indicators, relating to the financial market, professional forecasts, pricing behaviour by companies and by wage developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.87,0)">The slower inflation expectations adjust to the economic slowdown, the slower the central bank will adapt monetary conditions to the projected decrease in inflation risks over the policy-relevant horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.72,0)">In other words, it is not enough for the central bank to forecast accurately the slowdown of the economy, and the associated reduction in inflation risks, for it to act promptly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The private sector also needs to adjust its expectations accordingly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,134.32,0)">A consequence of the above is that in countries where the private sector, in particular the participants in the goods and labour markets, are less flexible in adjusting their pricing and wage behaviour in the face of exogenous shocks, the central bank will be slower in easing monetary policy when confronted with a slowdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.25,0)">This might explain some of the differences between monetary policy in the US and the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In the former, where markets are more flexible, the Federal Reserve may be able to cut interest rates in response to the economic slowdown at an earlier stage, because that slowdown is expected to bring about a rapid adjustment in pricing behaviour and expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.34,0)">In the euro area, however, price and wages tend to follow the cycle with a lag, and tend to keep rising for some time even after the slowdown starts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Let us consider the most recent example of the start of the easing cycle in the fall of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.99,0)">The euro area economy was projected to slow down in the second half of 2008 already for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.73,0)">For instance, in the ECB 2008 spring forecast, the euro area GDP growth was projected to fall from 2.7% in 2007 to 1.8% in 2008 and 1.5% in 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(43,255,0)">However, in spite of the projected slowdown, inflationary pressures continued to rise until the summer of 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Headline inflation rose to 4%, on account of strong commodity price pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Long-term inflation expectations derived from inflation-linked bonds increased in the course of the spring, from levels slightly above 2% to levels above 2.5% in June 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">Shorter term forecasts from Consensus, the ECB’s Survey of Professional Forecasters   and other private sector forecasts, as well as forecasts from international organisations, pointed to an inflation rate above 2% in 2009.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Growth in compensation per employee also continued to increase in the second and third quarter of 2008 at a rate above 3%, in spite of the expected economic slowdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.75,0)">Under these circumstances, a premature interest rate cut would have signalled a passive acceptance of such behaviour, which would have translated into a further misalignment of price and wage expectations with respect to the underlying fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.2,0)">This would have made the current slowdown ultimately more severe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,194.73,0)">In conclusion, with the benefit of hindsight, the easing cycle often seems to start too late.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.67,0)">However, this apparent delay is due to the rather inflexible adjustment of private sector expectations and behaviour.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">At what speed should monetary policy be eased?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.92,0)">This question gives rise to a related one: is there an asymmetry between a loosening phase and a tightening phase?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Should policy-makers react more strongly, and faster, to negative deviations of the inflation forecast from the inflation objective, compared with positive deviations?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.42,0)">Suppose that the economy was characterised by a linear structure, with slowdowns and recoveries of similar intensity, and that the policy-makers’ preferences have the form of a quadratic loss function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">In this case, the optimal behaviour of policy-makers should be characterised by a linear response function: the interest rate would react proportionally to deviations of inflation and the output gap from desired levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">In practice, we observe that monetary policy easing tends to be quicker and more decisive than tightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.76,0)">This means that one of the two simplifying assumptions mentioned above does not hold.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let’s consider first the policy-makers’ preferences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.62,0)">An argument which is sometimes advanced in support of asymmetric central bank behaviour is political pressure on central banks, which might be stronger during an economic downturn than at a time of inflationary pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,141.3,0)">Cukierman and Gerlach show formally how inflation bias in monetary policy can arise due to the combination of asymmetric concerns about positive and negative output gaps, and uncertainty about the future state of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.84,0)">This observation could explain why the loosening phases of monetary policy reductions are generally quicker than the tightening ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(169,255,0)">They obtain this result despite the fact that, in their model, the central bank’s desired level of economic activity is the same as potential output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.92,0)">This is in contrast with the traditional literature, which derives inflation bias based on ‘time-consistency’ arguments, related to the fact that the central bank targets a level of economic activity which is above potential output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Cukierman and Gerlach find support for their theory using data from 22 OECD countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.57,0)">This hypothesis nevertheless does not seem to be fully convincing for independent central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.41,0)">Surico  , for instance, produced evidence suggesting that the Federal Reserve exhibited asymmetric preferences only until 1979, with a stronger reaction of the interest rate to output contractions than to output expansions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.6,0)">In discussing his experience as Vice-Chairman of the Fed, Alan Blinder seems to suggets the opposite: ‘…in most situations the central bank will take far more political heat when it tightens pre-emptively to avoid higher inflation than when it eases pre-emptively to avoid higher unemployment’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This is also consistent with my own experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.38,0)">There were many more pressures on the ECB – not only from political authorities but also from academics – at the start of the tightening cycle, at the end of 2005, than during the loosening cycle of the last few months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.03,0)">Needless to say, such pressures have obviously no impact on the conduct of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.45,0)">Independent central banks are used to hearing but not listening, as Wim Duisenberg once said.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,203.09,0)">The alternative hypothesis is that the business cycle itself is asymmetric.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.12,0)">Wesley Mitchell, a pioneer of business-cycle analysis, wrote in 1927: ‘…business contractions appear to be briefer and more violent than business expansions’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.95,0)">Modern economic analysis, based on data from the United States, confirms that contractions in employment tend to be more abrupt than expansions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.01,0)">Furthermore, cyclical downturns may be associated with financial market turbulence and blockages in some segments of the financial market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">Under these circumstances, it is appropriate for the central bank to ease monetary policy quite rapidly, in line with the expected slowdown of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">If inflation expectations remain well anchored during a downturn, it might be preferable to err on the side of quick and large reductions in the interest rates than on the side of gradualism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">A key question in this respect is how far down to go – an issue I’ll consider next.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">But assuming that the central bank has a view on the appropriate level, it is preferable to reach it sooner than later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.16,0)">The reason is that the stimulatory effect of a rate cut is limited if agents expect the central bank to implement further cuts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.11,0)">Agents may delay their borrowing decisions for investment or consumption purposes until interest rates reach the lowest level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.11,0)">On the other hand, the rate which matters for investment or borrowing decisions is not necessarily the very short-term one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.66,0)">Longer-term rates also matter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,72.18,0)">An undesirable outcome of a decision to lower the policy-relevant interest rate would be to lead to an increase in the long-term ones, especially if it is so in real terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.74,0)">This would discourage investment and penalise agents holding longer-term risky assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">To avoid such a problem, any policy rate cut has to be justified on the basis of the prevailing monetary policy framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.38,0)">Any departure from such a framework, through erratic and unexpected behaviour, would risk being misinterpreted by economic agents and be associated with a change in the underlying approach to monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.09,0)">If this happened, the predictability of monetary policy, which is an important asset for central banks, would be undermined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.1,0)">For instance, sharp unexpected cuts in interest rates might lead market participants to expect more cuts in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,97.07,0)">They might also fuel expectations that the central bank has more   information on the underlying economic developments or on financial market risks than market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.16,0)">This might aggravate pessimistic expectations about economic and financial conditions, more than would be justified by the facts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,99.1,0)">Over recent months the deterioration in economic conditions, as reflected by the sharp fall in all leading indicators, and the rapid decrease in inflation, has created room for fast and substantial cuts in interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.53,0)">The ECB has cut its key policy rate by 275 basis points since October last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">It has done so with unprecedented moves, including one move taken outside the regular monetary policy meetings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">But it has also done so within its traditional monetary policy framework, in order to provide market participants with the appropriate analytical anchor to understand its decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Another issue to take into account is the transmission of the easing impulse of monetary policy to the rest of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.27,0)">It is not sufficient that the policy rate is reduced to ensure that monetary conditions are eased accordingly; the stance of monetary policy has to be measured also on the basis of overall financing conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.44,0)">The monetary transmission mechanism might be impaired, in particular because of financial instability or problems incurred by the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.0,0)">Under these circumstances, it is not sufficient to ease monetary policy by lowering official interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(185,255,0)">Measures aimed at improving the transmission of the monetary impulse to the rest of the economy need to be implemented, in order to affect the interest rates that are really relevant for borrowing and lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Improving the functioning of the financial market is not a task that can be achieved by the central bank only.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Central banks have adopted in recent months measures in this direction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">I will not try to summarise what the ECB has done in this field, and what it indends to do in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.42,0)">However, without a more decisive action by the fiscal and by the supervisory authorities to recapitalise the banking system and ensure more transparent accounting and loss recognition, the transmission mechanism will continue to remain impaired, thereby hampering the effectiveness of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.95,0)">This is a risk for the credibility of central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.58,0)">I also see a risk that the other authorities hide behind the activism of the central banks and shirk from their own responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,103.97,0)">The current situation is certainly a good example of how a very accommodative monetary policy stance in major industrial countries, aimed at supporting economic activity and maintain price stability, is partly impaired by financial market distress, in particular in the interbanking market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">For instance, in the US, while the overnight rate is close to zero, the 3-month Libor rate, which is a key rate in the transmission mechanism, is around 1.3%, in line with the 2003-2004 period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.45,0)">In the euro area, the 3-month Euribor rate has progressively fallen to a level slightly below the ECB policy rate, which was 2% until yesterday, and in line with the levels prevailing in 2003-2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.78,0)">After yesterday’s decision to reduce policy rates to 1.5%, the 3-month Euribor rate is expected to fall to a level very close to the one prevailing in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.62,0)">The overnight rate will also fall, presumably to levels just above 0.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.98,0)">When to stop easing?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.16,0)">Finally, let me turn to the last of the three questions on monetary policy loosening: when to stop?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.92,0)">This is like asking: what interest rate level should mark the floor of an easing cycle?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.73,0)">The standard literature would suggest that the answer to this question depends on forecasts about the slowdown of the economy and the underlying inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,146.76,0)">The greater the output gap and the lower the inflation expectations, the more the interest rate should be cut to support the economy while maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.91,0)">The literature has rationalised such a relationship with the estimate of reaction functions or Taylor rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.83,0)">In recent years, the discussion has been pushed further, with the suggestion that, given the uncertainties surrounding forecasts and estimates of output gaps and inflation, it might be appropriate to bring the policy-relevant interest rate substantially below the level consistent with the output gap and inflation, even to zero, its natural floor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Following this argument, as soon as the economy is hit by a negative shock monetary policy should err on the expansionary side, this risk being more acceptable than the opposite one, and this could contribute to bringing output rapidly back to a level consistent with potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">As output starts moving back to potential, the interest rate would then be increased again, back towards its longer-term level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">This view is based on the assumption that a rate cut to an extremely low level would have no counterargument and would actually enable the economy to recover more quickly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">It also assumes that when the economy starts recovering, the central bank would face no obstacles to increase rates quickly enough to avoid fuelling inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In this regard, some observations are useful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,90.63,0)">First, a policy which consists of cutting rates to very low levels and then increasing them rapidly as the economy reaches the trough of the cycle might not be very effective in supporting economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.09,0)">Agents might be induced to borrow more agressively when interest rates are at zero, since borrowing conditions can only worsen thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.85,0)">Yet, if the main problem faced by the economy is insufficient lending, for instance, because of weak confidence in the banking sector, rather than insufficient borrowing, what matters most for the recovery is to convince savers to hold risky long-term assets to finance the banking system and the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">When rates are at zero, or close to zero, the likelihood that interest rates will move up increases, especially if the central bank is committed to increasing rates as early as needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.32,0)">Such a rate increase would penalise those on the lending side who have invested in risky long-term assets, as they would suffer a capital loss.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.35,0)">A policy of very low interest rate levels favours borrowers but penalises lenders, and if the economic crisis is associated mainly with a lending crisis, a policy of extremely low interest rate might be counterproductive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.05,0)">If the rate cut stops at a higher level, consistent with the medium-term inflationary projections, it is more likely that the interest rate will remain at that   floor level for some time and lenders will be more inclined to invest in long-term risky assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">It might seem paradoxical, but a policy of persistently low interest rates might be more credible at a slightly higher level of interest rate than at zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The ECB’s announcement that it will provide fixed rate liquidity allotments at unlimited amounts for a prolonged period should also contribute to the effectiveness of this signal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.17,0)">An excessively low level of interest rates may also have some unintended consequences in financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.57,0)">It might drive some financial intermediaries out of business, for example money market funds having small, but strictly positive investment fixed costs and not anymore in the position to offer positive net returns to risk averse investors, thus risking large redemptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.36,0)">It could also trigger a disorderly unwinding of investment in certain securities, causing mis-pricing in other market segments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.96,0)">This problem could be more serious in a situation in which large parts of the financial system are already distressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">I would also like to emphasise that even at zero rates the central bank can stimulate lending by entering directly into the credit market, making up for the absence of lenders and buying long-term assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.26,0)">This however implies that the central bank is willing to take the capital losses that are likely to emerge when interest rates are increased again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.45,0)">Furthermore, monetary policy becomes blurred with fiscal policy and risks crowding out the functioning of the private capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">In any case, its effectiveness in lowering long term interest rates and thus inducing other agents to buy risky assets has to be demonstrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Another way to avoid the first problem mentioned above is for the central bank to convince market participants that they will not suffer capital losses because interest rates will remain low for a prolonged period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.89,0)">Agents might tend to have such expectations if they foresee the economy remaining in recession for a protracted period or if they project deflationary pressures ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.17,0)">This would be reflected in a flat yield curve and low long-term rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">However, if the yield curve does not reflect such deflationary expectations, the central bank may try to flatten it by committing to maintain low interest rates for a prolonged period of time, and may try to convince agents that they can safely invest their savings in long-term assets without incurring in capital losses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.21,0)">Yet such a policy may encounter a series of additional problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">By committing to keep rates low for a prolonged period of time, the central bank is effectively reneging on its promess of raising rates as quickly as possible once the trough of the cycle has been reached.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.13,0)">De facto, the policy of cutting rates to zero and then raising them quickly is not time-consistent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">After rates have been cut the central bank has an incentive to keep rates low for some time to encourage agents to invest in risky assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.59,0)">Any such inconsistency between what is signalled or announced and what is delivered ex post can undermine the credibility of the central bank and hamper the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">Furthermore, such a policy is a prologue to maintaining low rates for a very long time, possibly too long, thus favouring the formation of a new bubble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.65,0)">Indeed, when rates are increased again the holders of long-term assets are hit by a capital loss, thus negatively affecting the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The incentive is to delay such a hit until the economy is well on the way to recovery, thus avoiding to “rock the boat”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.47,0)">Central banks are often accused of increasing rates too early.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.65,0)">In 1994 even the Fed’s modest interest rate increase was heavily criticised by financial markets, as it led to a sharp increase in market volatility and substantial losses for many market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.55,0)">In December 2005, when the ECB increased rates after holding them at 2% for over two years, politicians, academics and commentators criticised the decision, presumably on the grounds that it would undermine the recovery.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,124.62,0)">This is not to say that central banks should not stand ready to reduce interest rates when needed, even to very low levels, but to suggest that, the longer they wait to raise rates when the economic situation so requires, the sharper will be the impact on the financial markets and thus on the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">Finally, bringing rates to zero and committing to keep them there for as long as needed, even while agents rule out a deflationary scenario, suggests that the central bank knows more than the private sector about deflationary risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.22,0)">This message is risky and might be misinterpreted by market participants, who might then reconsider their own expectations, thus increasing the probability of deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.54,0)">This could disanchor expectations and increase the probability of the worst-case scenario materialising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.41,0)">To sum up, cutting rates to zero, or to a level below what would be justified by the underlying fundamentals can lead to substantial problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.87,0)">Overall, policy-makers have to balance type I and type II errors, and their potential implications.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.11,0)">The type I error is to underestimate a deflationary scenario, and keep rates too high, which would further exacerbate deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.68,0)">The type II error, in contrast, is to attach too high a probability to a deflationary scenario which is not on the cards, and to cut interest rates to a very low level, even zero.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.3,0)">This would then create the next bubble and unleash a new crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.73,0)">Some would suggest that the type I error is always the gravest, with the most serious consequences for the economy, while the type II error can be more easily corrected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.59,0)">The arguments developed above show that type II errors can be just as grave and are not so easily reversible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Empirical evidence seems to support that type II errors are not uncommon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In particular, Jarociński and Smets   estimate a VAR model for the US, using real GDP, the GDP deflator, the federal funds rate, and so on, to answer the following two questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.69,0)">First, “Was US monetary policy excessively expansionary at the beginning of this millennium?” In other words, was the federal funds rate kept low for too long between 2002 and 2004, on average, given the circumstances prior to that period?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The answer is “Yes”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The second question is, “Did this expansionary monetary policy cause a part of the housing boom in 2004 and 2005?” Again, the answer from the VAR model is “Yes”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Putting the two answers together, we see that easy monetary policy prompted by the perceived risks of deflation between 2002 and 2004 contributed to the housing boom in the years thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.37,0)">And, I would add, the crisis we are currently in is the result of the bursting of that bubble.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Obviously, we should be careful in interpreting these results.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">But they have been confirmed by other research.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">To be sure, these results are obtained with the benefit of hindsight.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.42,0)">It is certainly possible – even likely – that, had the the extent of the housing bubble been known two, three years ahead, the interest rate decision would have been different.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">On the other hand, this suggests that we should learn from the experience of the last decade.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.53,0)">This doesn’t mean that policy-makers should not stand ready to cut rates to a very low level, even to zero, if the underlying conditions in the economy justify it, in particular if the economy is really on the verge of persistent deflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.8,0)">And in such a case it is better to do it sooner rather than later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.37,0)">However, if the economy is not in that predicament, cutting rates to a very low level, even to zero, just to insure against the worst case scenario can have deleterious effects in both the short and long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Conclusions To conclude, I have analysed today three questions that policy-makers have been pondering in recent months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.21,0)">The answers can be summarised as follows: first, start cutting rates when you see growth slowing down but not before inflation expectations abate towards the objective of price stability; second, cut rates quickly, but within a credible monetary policy framework; third, be careful to avoid overshooting and cutting interest rates to too low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">To be sure, any decision on the easing of monetary policy, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.44,0)">when to cut rates, how quickly, and to what level, has to be based on an assessment of the underlying and projected economic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.18,0)">I do not believe it is sound to always err on the side of excessive easing, and to insure against the worst-case deflationary scenario, even when such a scenario is unlikely to materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It would be like giving antibiotics for curing any cough, just in case it could be bacterial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">That medicine not only is not appropriate, but can also weaken the body and facilitate the attack of the real bacteria, when they finally come later on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.25,0)">To sum up, there are no safe bets for central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Before taking decisions, policy-makers must make every effort to diagnose the state of the economy and seriously evaluate all risks ahead.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Only then should they draw up a carefully considered prescription.</span>
