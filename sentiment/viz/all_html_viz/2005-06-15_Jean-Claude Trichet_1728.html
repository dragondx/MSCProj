    <span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)"> English translation of a contribution by Jean-Claude Trichet, President of the European Central Bank, published in Le Monde, in the edition dated 16 June 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The publication of the translation was authorised by Le Monde.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Europe is experiencing a significant and demanding episode in our profoundly original historic undertaking, namely a voluntary Union of peoples and nations, which began 55 years ago with the launch of the Schuman Plan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">More than half a century of economic and democratic construction, with its highs and lows, its latent periods and its periods of acceleration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,148.86,0)">This is not the first time that a new idea or project has been put aside for some time or rejected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,132.49,0)">The rejection by France of the European Defence Community in August 1954 was initially regarded as signalling the end of European construction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">However, Europe then set itself new objectives, objectives which have proved to be historically successful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.58,0)">Did Jean Monnet not write in his memoirs that “those who never want to do anything because they have no guarantee that things will happen as planned are condemning themselves to immobility”?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The historical evolution of Europe progresses at its own pace, which can be assessed only in the long term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">I have confidence in the ability of Europe to overcome its present difficulties and I share the sentiment of confidence and resolve expressed in the joint statement issued by Josep Borrell Fontelles, Jean-Claude Juncker and José Manuel Barroso, the Presidents of the European Parliament, the European Council and the European Commission respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.77,0)">The European Central Bank is, in its domain, a totally executive body.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Together with the national central banks of the euro area, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">the other members of the Eurosystem, it has been tasked with ensuring price stability for our 307 million fellow euro area citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">I feel it is important today to highlight five ideas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.59,0)">First, there is the issue of responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.09,0)">An independent monetary institution is ultimately responsible to public opinion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">It implies that the bank regularly answers questions put to it by the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Indeed, at an average of six times per year, I am invited to appear before the European Parliament, more often than my American counterpart appears before the US Congress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And the ECB Vice-President and I are, within the G7, unique among central bank representatives in holding a press conference immediately after every monetary policy decision by the Governing Council, 11 times per year, tirelessly explaining the Eurosystem’s analysis of the situation and the reasons why the Governing Council has taken the decision it has.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">The second idea is the importance of being faithful to our mandate – price stability – in the eyes of the citizens of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,182.41,0)">I am not just thinking of the Germans, who coined the term “Teuro” to express concern about the “expensive euro”, or the Italians, who consider that price rises remain excessive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">I am thinking about all consumers, the 307 million in the euro area, and particularly the least fortunate, who are in all European opinion polls sending us a clear message, asking us to be vigilant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">That is the reason why we say to everyone: “If you are hesitant in your decisions as a consumer because you fear the future erosion of your purchasing power, hesitate no longer, as you can count on us to guarantee the purchasing power of your money.” The third idea is that our faithfulness to our mandate also allows us to offer the most favourable financial environment possible for growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">As all savers and investors in Europe and throughout the world are convinced of our credibility, they are incorporating in their expectations future inflation in line with our definition of price stability, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.22,0)">“below and close to 2%”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">This remarkable result is due entirely to the very high level of confidence in the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.57,0)">This result explains in particular why the euro is today recording the lowest rates ever observed and the growth rate of outstanding loans to the private sector is   twice that of nominal GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,161.74,0)">As I write, ten-year rates on the best ratings have settled at 3.1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.69,0)">Who would have dared envisage that before the creation of the euro?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This is why we are saying to businesses: “Investment is your decision, a decision based on a number of criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.21,0)">One of those criteria is the level of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Is this not the moment to invest?” The fourth idea is that, contrary to a wrongly-held but widespread belief, the euro area has the same characteristics as the United States in terms of interregional differences relating to growth and inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.67,0)">In the United States, as in Europe, there are considerable differences from State to State and from region to region, and the growth and inflation differentials are of the same magnitude in the two economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">On both sides of the Atlantic the central bank looks at the relevant area’s economy as a whole, for all States or member countries together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(130,255,0)">I would also like to mention that for each European economy, belonging to the euro area is a "win-win" situation: not only in terms of achieving the concept of the internal market and enjoying the lowest interest rates because all risk premia by comparison with the best-performing currencies are eliminated, which is of particular benefit for those countries which had high market interest rates; but also because all risks associated with exchange rates are eliminated within one vast integrated economy, which is good for all countries, including those whose market rates were already low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">Turning to the fifth idea, on the question of whether we can contribute further to growth and job creation while fulfilling the requirements of our mandate, some say: “You should be less demanding in your definition of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.46,0)">2% is too low.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Make it 3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.36,0)">You could then reduce your intervention rates!” But such advice would backfire: by opting for 3% we would not only lose the confidence of households but also push all rates up, not down, with those rates incorporating the increase of 1% in expectations of future inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">And that would be totally counterproductive… Others make a more admissible remark and say: “Your definition of price stability is in line with a good anchoring of inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(146,255,0)">This is good for growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">But are you not doing too much?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.63,0)">Perhaps you could achieve the same result with lower intervention rates!” Yet this is not what the information we currently have available suggests: if we had been too cautious not only would our fellow citizens share that view   but also this would have had an impact on the observed price rises   and above all on inflation expectations, which would then be significantly less than 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.38,0)">This is not the case at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Regarding inflation expectations in particular, all of the public and private surveys and market indicators converge to 1.9% or 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,195.81,0)">We cannot be arithmetically closer to 2%!</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">These objective surveys show that we are doing what it necessary to ensure stability and credibility, no less…no more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">And that is why the Governing Council considers our interest rates to be appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.84,0)">We are not biased – I have said that I was not preparing the markets for a rate cut.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.99,0)">Nor am I preparing them for a rise in interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">We remain vigilant, realistic and pragmatic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,104.36,0)">*** A good monetary policy is necessary but not sufficient alone – it cannot achieve everything.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(96,255,0)">European citizens know that the Eurosystem is doing and will do all it can, thanks to and by being faithful to its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">A sound budgetary policy which complies with the Stability and Growth Pact is also essential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Structural reforms also have a decisive role to play in strengthening competitiveness, raising the potential growth rate and stimulating job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Behind all this is a key word in today's Europe: confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">Confidence on the part of households and firms, which must be nurtured and strengthened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">We are fortunate to have a European Central Bank which inspires such a level of confidence among Europeans and the rest of the world such that our market rates are at exceptionally favourable levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Let us maintain this precious confidence which has been entrusted to Europe.</span>
