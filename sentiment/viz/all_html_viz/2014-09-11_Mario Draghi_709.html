    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.56,0)"> Keynote speech at the Eurofi Financial Forum Keynote speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Eurofi Financial Forum,Milan, 11 September 2014 *** Summary We are facing a set of conditions – low growth and low inflation, high debt and high unemployment – that can only be addressed by concerted action on both the demand and supply sides of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This requires that all actors – both at national and European levels – play their parts in line with their respective mandate as laid down in the EU Treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">No monetary or fiscal stimulus can be successful if not accompanied by the right structural policies -- policies that foster potential growth and instil confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,61.68,0)">Investment has been one of the great casualties of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.73,0)">From peak to trough business investment in the euro area decreased by around 20% since 2008, against 15% in the 1992 recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">We will not see a sustainable recovery unless this changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">A decisive rise in investment is essential to bring inflation where we would want to see it, to kick-start the economy and to bring down unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">There are two key areas where national and European level government action can help revive investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">First, the regulatory environment should be made more favourable to economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">Second, companies need to have access to more diversified sources of financing: the launch of a capital markets union could contribute to achieving this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(214,255,0)">It is an idea that the ECB fully supports.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">The development of the market for simple and transparent Asset Backed Securities deserves particular support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">Member States should consider the provision of public guarantees to support lending to small and medium sized enterprises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">There also needs to be a consistent and credible application of the Stability and Growth Pact across time and across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">Within the existing framework, countries should explore how to support productive investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">In monetary policy, we have deployed a number of non-standard tools to ensure our very accommodative monetary policy stance is transmitted to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Last week, the Governing Council decided to start the purchase of certain high-quality asset-backed securities and covered bonds in October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Senior tranches of such ABS have proven to be high quality assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Alongside our Targeted Longer Term Refinancing Operations, we expect these measures will enhance the functioning of monetary policy transmission, provide further accommodation now that we are at the lower bound, and have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">*** Ladies and gentlemen, It is a pleasure to be here tonight with you in Milan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">In a recent speech in Jackson Hole, I spoke about the need for a policy mix involving monetary, fiscal and structural policies to jump-start the economic recovery in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.4,0)">We are currently facing a set of conditions – low growth and low inflation, high debt and high unemployment – that can only be addressed by concerted action on both the demand and supply sides of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This requires all actors – both at national and European level – to play their parts in line with their respective mandates as laid down in the EU Treaties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">No monetary stimulus, indeed no fiscal stimulus, can be successful unless accompanied by the right structural policies – policies that foster potential growth and instil confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">I would like to illustrate this argument by focusing on investment, which will also be discussed at the informal ECOFIN this weekend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,78.65,0)">Investment has been one of the great casualties of this crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.28,0)">The downturn in business investment in the euro area since 2008 has been much more severe than in earlier business cycles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.74,0)">From peak to trough, business investment decreased by around 20%, against 15% in the 1992 recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The level of business investment in the euro area has only slightly improved since 2008, whereas in the US it is above its pre-crisis level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">We will not see a sustainable recovery unless this changes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">A decisive rise in investment is essential to bring inflation closer to where we would want to see it, to stimulate the economy, and to bring down unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">So what can we policy- makers do to revive investment?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">My main message today is that only if structural, fiscal and monetary policies go hand in hand will the euro area see investment return.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Let me focus in particular on the decisive contribution which structural policies can make.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">A policy mix to revive investment I see two key areas where government action both at national and European level should help to revive business investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">First, the regulatory environment should be made more favourable to economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Second, companies need to have access to more diversified sources of financing: the launch of a capital markets union could contribute to achieving this and, at the same time, help overcome the remaining fragmentation of financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me briefly elaborate on each of these points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Improving the regulatory environment Business activity would greatly benefit from an improvement in the regulatory environment, in particular as regards product and labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">The differences between Member States are quite striking in respect of wage differentiation  , employment adjustment rigidities, barriers to entry in product markets and the ease of opening and running businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,93.15,0)">For example, in some Member States contractual disputes between firms take on average little more than a year to resolve, while in other countries they take more than three years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.86,0)">Start-ups in the latter countries have to deal with more red tape than their counterparts elsewhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Another telling example relates to the regulated professions whose number varies considerably across euro area Member States  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.88,0)">Such barriers to entry limit competition and employment, creating undue rents for a select few to the detriment of customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.39,0)">These are just a few examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.09,0)">In many cases, these obstacles sap entrepreneurial spirits, especially of young, innovative firms that create most of the new jobs and that are highly sensitive to changes in investment opportunities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">These examples show how converging towards best practice in the euro area would mean radical improvements in the business environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">Spain provides an encouraging example in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Among the large euro area countries, investment in Spain is projected to rebound strongly over the coming two years, notably due to the combination of business-friendly reforms and lower personal and corporate taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">More recently, other countries have also committed to improve the business environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">A forceful and swift implementation of the necessary reforms is now key in order to reap the benefits as quickly as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(91,255,0)">Strengthening the financing side A second area of key relevance for investment and also of direct interest to the Eurofi community here tonight is the need to diversify sources of financing and to overcome financial fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Until now, banks have been the main source of lending to companies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.19,0)">The crisis has shown the drawbacks of over-reliance on a bank-centred lending model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(174,255,0)">So we also need to develop reliable sources of non-bank lending, such as equity and bond markets, securitisation, lending from insurance companies and asset managers, venture capital and crowdfunding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">This is why the ECB fully supports the intention of the incoming President of the European Commission to create a capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Such a step would be a natural development of the Single Market and would benefit all EU Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">We believe that one area that deserves particular attention is the development of a well-functioning market for simple, transparent and real asset-backed securities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">This would allow banks to still originate loans – notably to small and medium-sized enterprises   – while preserving their balance sheet capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">In order to achieve a well-functioning ABS market, it is important that the regulatory treatment of securitisation is proportional to the risk of ABS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">In this respect, the ECB welcomes efforts to have a differentiated regulatory treatment of simple, transparent ABS built on real assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">Moreover, the provision of public guarantees should be considered to support lending to SMEs, as other countries do, such as the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">A further integration of corporate bond and equities markets is also essential to overcome the present fragmentation in the euro area and to ensure more robust cross-border lending and investment flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">To achieve this, we will have to streamline differences between countries, for instance, in the legal protection of borrowers’ and lenders’ rights as well as in national taxation and insolvency procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">To sum up, structural policies are more multifaceted than they are often perceived to be in the political debate and can have a very significant impact on investment in a variety of ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">Growth-friendly fiscal policy Yet this is not the only area where governments can make a difference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">They have at their disposal a second policy lever of direct relevance for investment, namely fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Companies will only invest in the future when there is confidence and certainty about the future, about the medium-term fiscal path, and ultimately about taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">We need a consistent and credible application of the Stability and Growth Pact across time and across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">Within the existing framework, governments can find space to support productive investment, and achieve a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies by lowering the tax burden and reducing unproductive current expenditures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">In parallel, it may be useful to have a discussion on the overall fiscal stance of the euro area with the view to raising public investment where there is fiscal space to do so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">In this regard, there is also a complementary role to play at European level in supporting the rebound in private investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">I therefore welcome the €300 billion package announced by the incoming Commission President two months ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The role of monetary policy Let me finally say a few words on the contribution of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,85.97,0)">We successfully fought the confidence crisis in the euro that raised interest rates to abnormal levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">We provided the euro area banking system with unprecedented funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.64,0)">We have continuously lowered our policy rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.27,0)">Now we have reached the lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">To ensure that this very accommodative monetary policy stance is transmitted to the real economy across the euro area in an equal manner, we have also deployed a number of non-standard tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.41,0)">Increasingly our focus here has shifted towards the financing of small and medium-sized enterprises, which heavily rely on bank financing and in many cases are struggling to retain access to credit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.38,0)">These companies may be small, but when they face a funding problem, it is a big problem for all of us, given that they employ around three-quarters of the euro area’s workforce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">In June, we decided to launch a series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations – TLTROs – to ensure that banks have sufficient liquidity to lend to the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">The TLTROs have been designed to encourage banks to increase their lending to the non-financial corporate sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In addition, we have also taken measures to underpin specific market segments that play a key role in the financing of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Last week, the Governing Council decided to start buying high-quality asset-backed securities and covered bonds in October.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">We will purchase both existing and newly issued ABS, which are simple, transparent and real in the sense that the underlying assets consist of loans to the euro area non-financial private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Let me respond to the concerns recently expressed about the risks posed to the integrity of our balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">It is worth recalling that senior tranches of ABS have proven to be high-quality assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.1,0)">According to the Association of Financial Markets in Europe, only 0.12% of European residential mortgage-backed securities   outstanding in mid-2007 have defaulted since then – compared with 22.05% for US RMBS.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.54,0)">Default rates for consumer finance ABS and SME collateralised loan obligations have also remained low, well below 1%, throughout the worst financial and economic crisis we have experienced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">As regards covered bonds, credit quality is ensured by a double recourse  , which is in fact comparable with the double protection that exists in our standard repo operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Overall, the decisions announced last week were taken with a view to underpinning the firm anchoring of medium to long-term inflation expectations, in line with our aim of maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">We expect the two purchase programmes to effectively complement the TLTROs in enhancing the functioning of the monetary policy transmission and in providing further monetary accommodation given that we have now reached the lower bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">The newly decided measures, together with the TLTROs, will have a sizeable impact on our balance sheet, which is expected to move towards the dimensions it used to have at the beginning of 2012, and the Governing Council stands ready to take further action if needed, in compliance with its mandate to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Conclusion Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for me to conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">My bottom line is also my starting line.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Investment is rightly said to be today’s demand and tomorrow’s supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.12,0)">Yet investment in Europe is falling short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.27,0)">If we don’t manage to get investment going again, we will weaken the economy in the short run and undermine its prospects in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Our efforts should therefore be focused on jump-starting investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">However, and this was really the crux of my argument, we will only manage to stimulate investment if structural, fiscal and monetary policies mutually reinforce each other.</span>
