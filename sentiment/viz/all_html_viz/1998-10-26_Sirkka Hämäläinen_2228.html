    <span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)"> The European perspective on the euro Presentation by Ms Sirkka Hämäläinen at the Euro Conference, Fordham University, New York, on 26 October 1998.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.99,0)">The implications of the euro for the economic policy framework in Europe On entering the European Monetary Union, the eleven participating countries will permanently give up their own national monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Monetary policy decisions will be taken by the Governing Council of the ECB and will be based on euro area wide considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">The primary objective of the ESCB is to maintain price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Price stability has been defined as a year-on-year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices   for the euro area of below 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">In order to achieve this objective, the ESCB will pursue a strategy comprising two elements: 1) money will be assigned a prominent role through the announcement of a quantitative reference value for the growth of a broad monetary aggregate; and 2) there will be a broadly-based assessment of the outlook for price developments on the basis of a wide range of indicators.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.68,0)">The focus on euro area wide developments implies that if an asymmetric shock were to hit a specific Member State, or if business cycles were not to be synchronised across the euro area, the necessary adjustment at the national level would have to be performed by fiscal and structural measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.93,0)">In practice, this situation was apparent already in the process towards Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">The convergence process towards Monetary Union meant that a degree of nominal convergence never before experienced in Europe was achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The credibility established through the convergence process became evident during the recent turmoil in the international financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Exchange rates remained stable within the exchange rate mechanism ERM and long-term interest rates spreads widened only slightly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,171.1,0)">While recognising the achievements made in embarking on a path towards stability-oriented policies and a high degree of nominal convergence, we also have to admit that unemployment is still unacceptably high in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.97,0)">However, I would like to stress that monetary policy is neither the cause of nor the solution to the unemployment problem in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.91,0)">The problems with European labour markets are structural.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Unemployment in Europe can thus only be effectively combated through reforms addressing these underlying structural problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">On the whole, the economic fundamentals of the euro area economies look better now than they have done for many decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Inflation is low, savings are high, public finances have improved and domestic demand seems to continue being strong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Even if it is clear that external effects will hamper the growth prospects also in the euro countries, it appears that the euro area is presently experiencing more stable and favourable economic conditions than most other regions in the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">The role of the euro in the international financial system The introduction of the euro will be the biggest change in the international financial system since the collapse of the Bretton Woods system in 1973.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">It is likely that the euro will play a very important role in the international financial markets, benefiting from the reputation inherited from the currencies which it will replace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Several arguments seem to indicate that the euro may become a more attractive investment currency than all the currencies which it will replace taken together.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">First, the integration of European markets will lead to lower transaction costs and higher market liquidity, thus possibly inducing a virtuous circle of increasing issuance and investment in euro denominated assets by international investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Second, the integrated euro area financial markets will offer a more diversified set of financial instruments than that which is currently available in any national market of the euro area today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">This will give international investors a greater scope for portfolio diversification without their having to incur additional foreign exchange risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Third, to the extent that the euro area is a large and rather closed economy, yields on bonds denominated in euro are likely to become increasingly independent from changes in US yields as compared with the present situation for bonds denominated in the national currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">If so, euro area bonds will provide an attractive opportunity for investors who would like to achieve increased risk diversification in relation to US financial instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Fourth, the euro may also become an attractive currency for the investment of official reserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">It may become an important anchor currency in other European countries which, formally or informally, might find it useful to peg their exchange rate to the euro or to a basket of currencies in which the euro is a large component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Apart from the non-euro EU currencies to be included in the new exchange rate mechanism ERM II, this may also be an attractive solution for transition countries in Central and Eastern Europe and non-EU Mediterranean countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">A further aspect of the internationalisation of the euro will be its developing role as a transaction and vehicle currency for cross-border transactions outside the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(166,255,0)">Today, the US dollar is by far the most important international transaction currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">The euro may become an important currency for invoicing of foreign trade and for spot foreign exchange operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">On the whole, there is little doubt that the euro will have a more important role in the international financial system than any of its constituent currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Confidence in the future internal and external stability of the euro will be a key factor in determining the international importance of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">Another factor will be the efficiency and international competitiveness of the European financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">The role of the euro for the development of the European financial markets The European financial markets are currently undergoing a rapid development characterised by cross-border integration and provision of new financial services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">I should like to highlight a few areas where the introduction of the euro is likely to directly influence the working of the financial markets in the euro area: First, the conduct of a single monetary policy is expected to lead to a fully integrated money market in the euro area as from the start of Stage Three.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">The integration of the existing national money markets will be made possible thanks to the TARGET system, which will connect the national real-time gross settlement systems in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">It will thereby facilitate banks' cross-border dealing and accessing of funds in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Second, the ESCB has developed a market oriented monetary policy framework, largely relying on regular reverse transactions offered through tender procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">This is likely to provide an incentive for the establishment of a euro area-wide interbank repo market and, possibly, at a later stage, a private repo market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">Third, the ESCB will also make use of a minimum reserve system so as to pursue the aims of stabilising money market rates and enlarging the structural deficit of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">Particular emphasis was placed on the establishment of a minimum reserve system which is compatible with market principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">For example, the reserve holdings will be remunerated at the rate of the ESCB's main refinancing operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Fourth, the ESCB will accept a wide range of public and private assets as collateral for its credit operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">It will also provide the counterparties' with the possibility to use collateral cross-border within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">This approach is likely to provide a stimulus to the development of markets for private assets, portfolio diversification across the euro area and the integration of capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Fifth, the integration of the financial markets will benefit from the ESCB's work to harmonise market practices in the euro area-wide money market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">The move to Monetary Union may in due time also contribute to a harmonisation of practices in bond and equity markets in the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">This harmonisation will improve the effectiveness of price formation and contribute to more efficient financial markets across the board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">On a more general level, cross-border integration may promote the markets for commercial paper and corporate bonds in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">The market value of corporate bonds outstanding in the US is at present almost ten times larger than in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(114,255,0)">There is thus plenty of scope for further securitisation in the euro area and the introduction of the euro certainly underpins this development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">These developments will have important structural implications for the banking industry in the euro area in addition to the effects of increased cross-border competition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">So far, the European banking industry has remained segmented into rather small national markets; the introduction of the euro is expected to give momentum to cross-border integration in the European banking sector resulting from the disappearance of the natural "protective barriers" implied by national currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">To conclude: The developments of the European financial sector are likely to greatly improve the efficiency in the mobilisation of savings and in the channelling of these savings into productive investments - and thus improve the growth potential of the euro area as a whole.</span>
