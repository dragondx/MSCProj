    <span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)"> Three Questions on Monetary Tightening Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECBNomura conferenceTokyo, 26-27 October 2006 Introduction In the last two years the central banks of the three major currencies have started to increase interest rates again, after a prolonged period of low or decreasing rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The three experiences differ in many dimensions, in particular with respect to timing and pace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(182,255,0)">The Federal Reserve started first, in June 2004, and since then rates have been raised by 425 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(81,255,0)">The European Central Bank started in December 2005, with a 125 basis points increase in less than one year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">In Japan the process has just started, in July 2006, with a 25 basis points increase from the zero interest rate floor.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The three episodes have nevertheless some common features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.24,0)">In all cases the tightening cycle started from a historically low level of interest rates, both in nominal and real terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.48,0)">At the starting point, the US Federal Fund rate was at 1 per cent in nominal terms and around -2 when deflated by headline inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.49,0)">The ECB refinancing rate was at 2 per cent in nominal terms and around zero in real terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.01,0)">The Bank of Japan target for the overnight call rate was at zero both in nominal and real terms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.75,0)">The fact that the level of the nominal and real interest rate were rather low, compared to historical levels and to underlying economic and monetary conditions   suggests that at the start of the tightening cycle monetary policy was quite expansionary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.28,0)">In other words, the initial level of the interest rate was substantially below the so-called “neutral” level, which is the level of the interest rate that ensures price stability for given underlying conditions, at least in the most plausible scenario.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Such a low level might have been warranted in the presence of sizeable downside risks, but was unsustainable once these risks receded.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.84,0)">According to standard macroeconomic analysis, if the interest rate is systematically below its “neutral” level monetary policy is expansionary and might ultimately fuel inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">Therefore, even if interest rate is raised but remains below the “neutral” level, monetary conditions continue to be expansionary, although to a lesser degree.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">On the basis of these considerations, it would appear that in spite of the recent interest rate increases in the three largest areas monetary conditions have remained significantly expansionary, as confirmed by the ample liquidity conditions prevailing at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Rather than a fully-fledged monetary tightening one should thus rather speak of a reduction in the degree of monetary expansion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.95,0)">In a tightening cycle central banks have to address three main questions: When to start tightening?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.67,0)">At what speed tighten?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.86,0)">When to stop tightening?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">I will try to examine these three questions in light of the most recent experience and taking into account three main problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">First, an information problem: how to interpret incoming data to assess and forecast economic developments so as to calibrate the appropriate interest rate response.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.66,0)">Second, an incentive   problem: how to balance the risk of acting too early or being too late, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.83,0)">being ahead or behind the curve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Third, a communication problem: how to communicate policy decisions and intentions to the market and the public, especially in light of uncertainty about underlying economic developments, to promote predictability and safeguard the credibility of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.11,0)">These challenges are not independent and may actually compound, as I shall discuss in more detail later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let’s examine the three questions in turn.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Let me clarify from the start that the purpose of these considerations is to try develop a conceptual framework, based largely on the recent experience, rather than to provide indications about future monetary policy developments, in particular for the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Indeed, the future might provide us with new insights, which have not been taken into account and that might lead to a reconsideration of this analysis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.11,0)">When to start tightening?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,126.96,0)">It is well known that monetary policy implies long and variable transmission lags and that the lags are longer for inflation than for output.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">This implies that an optimal monetary policy tightening should start some quarters ahead of the upswing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.19,0)">If we start from a situation of negative excess demand, in which economic activity is lower than potential  , the expectation of output growing above potential   should trigger the start of tightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.57,0)">If the central bank fails to increase interest rates at that point, inflationary pressures might pile up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">An important corollary is that the start of the tightening cycle should not wait for headline inflation to rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The increase in interest rate, which as I mentioned previously initially entails only a reduction in the degree of monetary expansion rather than an absolute tightening, has to start before inflationary pressures materialise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">It is aimed at ensuring that inflation does not rise later on, when it is too late and more costly to bring inflation down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">The sooner interest rates are raised, as economic activity recovers, the less interest rates will have to be increased later on to maintain price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.39,0)">In implementing this strategy the central bank is faced with the three problems mentioned previously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.98,0)">Let me start with the information problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,121.47,0)">It is very difficult to forecast the beginning of an upswing, giving the uncertainties prevailing around turnarounds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.48,0)">According to some, this problem should not be so serious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.99,0)">If the central bank has a simple linear-quadratic loss function, uncertainty does not affect the optimality of the policy decision, ex-ante.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The central bank should thus use its best forecast as a basis for such a decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,154.87,0)">The experience of the early 1970s confirms that hesitating for too long at the start of a tightening cycle may be quite dangerous.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.97,0)">Recent research has shown that the Great Inflation of the 1970s may have originated from the combination of an information problem   and an incentive problem, due to the fact that a tightening would have been politically costly at times of rising unemployment and slowing output growth, especially in an intellectual environment in which the long-term link between inflation and monetary policy was less than fully clear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Some might find it appropriate for the central bank to wait until there is clear evidence that growth has picked up above potential and that the output gap has started to close before starting to tighten.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The risk of having possibly waited too long and having been behind the curve could be reduced through an acceleration of the pace of tightening thereafter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.82,0)">However, as I have indicated in a speech made in Berlin about one year ago, the risk of getting behind the curve   might further increase if the tightening starts at an interest rate level that is substantially below the “neutral” level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.41,0)">One lesson that might be drawn from the recent tightening cycle is that the lower is the starting point, in terms of interest rate level, the less a central bank can afford to wait to have confirmation of the ongoing recovery before starting to tighten.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">To be sure, even if the central bank might have some room to wait for data confirming the economic pick up, it should certainly not wait for inflation to be on the rise to increase interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.81,0)">This would clearly imply falling behind the curve and having to correct more abruptly at a later stage with sharper interest rate increases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">For the ECB, the monetary pillar of the strategy, which is based on the analysis of money and credit aggregates, proved to be quite a useful complement to motivate the start of the monetary tightening   at the end of 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(120,255,0)">In addition to the staff projections that were pointing to an inflation rate above the ECB’s definition of price stability over the whole forecasting horizon, the fast rate of growth of monetary and credit aggregates in the course of the second half of 2005 provided an independent confirmation that interest rates were extremely low in comparison to the underlying fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.94,0)">Not taking into account these monetary developments would have entailed a further risk of falling behind the curve, in an environment of very expansionary monetary conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.06,0)">A further challenge for the central bank is to explain the start of the tightening cycle to financial markets and the public at large.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.48,0)">Relying on economic forecasts alone might be difficult as the timing and pace of economic recovery are generally subject to wide debate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.64,0)">In addition, politicians and social partners tend to ask the usual question: “Why are you increasing interest rates if there is no inflation?” The obvious answer to the question is that what matters is not the current inflation rate but the outlook for future price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">However, given the uncertainties surrounding the assessment of the cyclical position, the central bank might want to use a variety of arguments and indicators to explain the reasons underlying the start of the tightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">I have found that a useful tool to address the communication challenge is a simple comparison between the prevailing real interest rate level and the rate of growth of real income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">As I mentioned previously, at the end of 2005 the real interest rate was close to zero in the euro area, while the rate of growth of economic activity was progressively picking up, from a yearly pace of around 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Even somebody with a basic economic background would understand that under these conditions keeping interest rates unchanged, at around zero in real terms, would have implied an increase in the degree of monetary expansion, which would have not been compatible over time with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.18,0)">The fast pace of monetary and credit aggregates and the dynamics of asset prices confirmed that the prevailing level of interest rate was very low and potentially jeopardising price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.84,0)">How fast to tighten?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">The second issue I would like to address is the speed of adjustment of policy rates once a tightening process is initiated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This will of course depend inter alia on the strength of the recovery, the level of the output gap, the starting position and the distance of the actual interest rate from a plausible measure of its long-term equilibrium level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.95,0)">All these considerations will obviously be surrounded by a great deal of uncertainty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">On the other hand, there is generally a lot of pressure on the central bank for it to be as explicit as possible on the foreseen interest rate path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.22,0)">How should central banks react to such a request?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Should central banks communicate to the market on how quickly they intend to bring the interest rate back to the equilibrium level  ?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">There is an interesting degree of variation in central bank practices around the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Some central banks, notably the Reserve Bank of New Zealand   and the Central Bank of Norway   have started to provide the public with a quantitative indication of the most likely course of policy as part of their macroeconomic policy projections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Other central banks, most notably the Federal Reserve, have provided a qualitative guidance on the likely direction and pace of interest rate moves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.33,0)">The ECB has instead refrained from giving guidance to market participants beyond the very short term  , leaving to the latter the task of setting their own expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.01,0)">In my view, the idea of giving markets explicit forward guidance has some advantages, but also some drawbacks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me elaborate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">There are three possible advantages of giving forward guidance to the markets, beyond the very short term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">First, and most important, it may enhance the central bank leverage over long-term interest rates and therefore increases the potency of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">This may not be a very important consideration at all times, but it may become quite useful once the central bank faces a significant risk of hitting the zero bound on nominal interest rates and if the private sector is unsure about the likely monetary policy response under such conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The objective of increasing the effectiveness of monetary policy may be particularly important if the central bank has previously fallen behind the curve and waited too long before increasing interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Under these circumstances, preannouncement may help anchoring market expectations and avoid an increase in inflationary expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">However, there is no guarantee that forward guidance will work if used occasionally, as I will explain in a moment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">A second potential advantage is that forward guidance may provide observers with a better understanding of the central bank reaction function.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Since the projected interest rate path is   dependent on the projected path of macroeconomic variables, a revelation of the preferred path may give the market more explicit information on how the central bank plans to react to certain   developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.49,0)">Interestingly enough, however, in Norway and New Zealand market interest rates have generally not always fully aligned to the path projected by the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Finally, the necessity of giving the market some forward guidance automatically forces the policy-making bodies to agree on a baseline scenario for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">This may provide a useful internal framework for discussion and favour a more structured and consistent communication policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">These are the advantages.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,138.74,0)">But there are also drawbacks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">First, even when they are not intended to be so, there is a certain risk that the projected interest rate path is interpreted by the markets as being as an unconditional commitment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,191.36,0)">This may happen even when the central bank is careful in explaining that deviations of actual rates from the projected path should be seen as the norm, rather than the exception, as is the case of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand and the Central Bank of Norway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">This is, in essence, a communication challenge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.55,0)">The problem is a serious one because the macroeconomic outlook might be subject to sizeable and frequent changes, in particular following the release of new data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">A central bank wishing to communicate in a consistent way the path of future interest rates would need to release a new path almost every month, or even more frequently, if it wants to be effective in its task of guiding markets and to be fully transparent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.21,0)">We can observe that the market yield curve can at times change quite significantly in a matter of weeks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.07,0)">For instance, the yield curve for the implied expected overnight rate in the euro area shifted down quite a bit between mid-August this year and mid-September.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.28,0)">If a central bank decided to communicate its expected interest rate path to guide the markets, it might have to do so with a very high frequency, at least on occasions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.35,0)">That could be quite confusing for market participants.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,62.56,0)">The second problem, which has not been sufficiently debated in the literature but is, in my opinion, quite important is that providing forward guidance to markets, at least to the extent to which it is intended to steer longer-term interest rates, may be difficult and costly to implement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">Forward guidance is effective if it is credible, and in order to be credible, the central bank has to deliver on past promises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.8,0)">Due to the unavoidable changes in the underlying economic conditions  , there may be occasions in which the central bank might have to deviate from its pre-announced path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In these cases it might not be clear ex post whether the central bank is reneging on past promises or simply reacting to newly available macroeconomic data in an optimal manner.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.99,0)">For a central bank that needs to establish its reputation, for instance because it might have started the tightening cycle too late and have fallen behind the curve, there could be an incentive to stick to the pre-announced path rather than trying to explain a deviation from it, even if it is justified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.7,0)">Third, and related to my previous point, a successful forward guidance may pre-empt private sector expectations, reducing their information content.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Rather than incorporating private information, bond prices would simply reflect the views of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,123.01,0)">Pre-empting private sector expectations of future interest rates would amount to restrict the information set on which policy is based.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.66,0)">This would make monetary policy less effective, exacerbating the information problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">While it is difficult to quantify the loss, my sense is that it would not be negligible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.72,0)">Finally, the need of agreeing on a full path of future interest rates, and eventually updating it in light of economic developments, might not be that easy, especially in a complex setting such as the Eurosystem where the Governing Council is composed of eighteen   members.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.41,0)">This consideration is especially important in a tightening cycle, when – as I mentioned earlier – monetary policy decisions are subject to criticism and political resistance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">In such an environment, it has been suggested that taking a step at a time might be preferable than agreeing on a grand strategy all at once.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.77,0)">The relevance of this type of problem very much depends on the institutional setting within and surrounding the central bank, which varies from country to country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The analytical tools used by central banks are also of some relevance here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Deciding on a path for future interest rates is easier if the monetary policy is geared towards a single inflation projection, as in an inflation targeting framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The ECB’s monetary policy strategy explicitly eschews the use of an all-encompassing model and is based on the systematic use of available information under the two pillars of the strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.33,0)">It is naturally much more difficult for this approach to be embedded in a one-dimensional model which automatically produces a nice chart for the future path of interest rates, conditional to a path for inflation forecasts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">All in all, it can be questioned that a strategy aimed at providing markets with explicit forward guidance has more advantages than drawbacks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The experience of the ECB over the recent tightening cycle, which consists of giving guidance only over the very short term   but not pre-committing beyond that horizon and basing rate decisions on underlying and projected economic developments has proved to be quite successful and well received by the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">In terms of market volatility beyond the very short term, there seems to be no majors cost to be paid, as compared to strategies that are more explicit on future interest rate path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.79,0)">For example, the degree of uncertainty perceived by market participants on the future course of monetary policy, as measured by the implied volatility on Euribor and Eurodollar futures contracts, is of the same order of magnitude in the euro area as in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Furthermore, sufficient flexibility has been kept to adjust the pace of the tightening to unexpected changes in the underlying economic conditions, moving in particular from a three month to a two months frequency in the 25 basis points increase.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.36,0)">Also, the possibility has been used by the ECB to signal clearly to the markets when the prevailing expectations did not coincide with its own assessment of the interest rate path, leading to an immediate correction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">What is really important, in my opinion, to effectively guide financial markets is to communicate very clearly the analytical framework of the central bank and how new information and data are incorporated in the decision making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">This should enable market participants to derive their own expectation about the future path of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This strategy might be more effective than pre-announcing the pace of the monetary tightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.86,0)">When to stop tightening?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.27,0)">This is in fact the most difficult question to answer, not only because downturns are difficult to forecast but also because the cost of a policy mistake at that stage is higher and there is less room to make up for it later on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.28,0)">Stopping too soon might unleash further inflationary pressures as the economy starts weakening, thus reducing the room for cutting interest rates to accommodate the slowdown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.26,0)">Stopping too late might worsen the economic downturn, with the need to reverse rapidly the policy direction, undermining the credibility of the central bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The end of the tightening cycle should ideally anticipate the turn of the cyclical position of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">If the economy grows above its potential and the output gap becomes positive, keeping inflationary pressures and expectations under control could require that the interest rate is increased above the long term equilibrium level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.45,0)">The main difficulty at the peak of the cycle is to calibrate the level of interest rate in such a way as to ensure price stability without affecting negatively economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">I would like to focus in particular on two variables relevant in this assessment: the growth rate of productivity and inflation expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">Over the cycle, the strengthening of productivity growth temporarily moderates firms’ marginal costs, including labour costs, thus dampening inflationary pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">One might conclude that as long as productivity recovers there is a lesser need to adjust interest rates because inflationary pressures are kept under control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.12,0)">This would be a wrong conclusion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Rising productivity implies a higher level of the “neutral” interest rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(30,255,0)">Keeping market rates unchanged while the “neutral” rate rises implies, as we have seen previously, an expansion of monetary conditions that will ultimately lead to higher inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">To avoid this effect interest rates have to be adjusted upwards, in line with the increase in the “neutral” rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">Hence, stronger productivity growth might result in higher, not lower nor constant, interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Put differently, increasing productivity growth has a dampening effect on inflationary pressure only to the extent that the interest rate is adjusted to take into account the increase in the “neutral” level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">The reasoning is quite similar to that used in the through of the cycle to assess the appropriateness of the interest rate level against nominal income growth, using a simple monetary framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">As the economic recovery strengthens, and the negative output gap is reduced or even tends to become positive, the level of the interest rate needs to be adjusted to avoid monetary conditions becoming excessively expansionary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The analysis has to consider both the price and real component of nominal income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">For instance, if inflation slows down, due to a fall in oil prices, but disposable income strengthens following the improvement in the terms of trade, the pace of nominal income growth could remain unchanged.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,187.37,0)">This implies that the interest rate path should not be affected by the fall in inflation, especially if temporary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.95,0)">This point is not easily appreciated by market participants and observers, and thus implies some communication effort by central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Another indicator that might be useful in guiding a central bank in the decision of when to stop tightening is agents’ inflationary expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These indicators have to be used with some caution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">In particular, evidence of stable long-term inflation expectations, consistent with price stability, do not necessarily imply that the monetary policy tightening can be stopped.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.93,0)">There are at least two reasons for this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,216.0,0)">First, the analysis of data on inflation expectations is not straightforward since financial market indicators   tends to differ from, and be more reactive than expectations drawn from survey data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,125.93,0)">In the US, for example, inflation expectations derived from bond yields fluctuated significantly over recent years, while survey-based measures   have barely moved at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">It is therefore not obvious which measure is most reliable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.97,0)">Second, and most important, long term inflation expectations might remain low or even fall at the peak of the cycle, but might rise again if headline inflation does not rapidly fall in parallel with the slowdown of the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,199.21,0)">If this happens, it is then difficult   to bring expectations back to levels consistent with price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.21,0)">It might require keeping rates at a significantly high level for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.0,0)">Indeed, experience suggests that expectations have some intrinsic inertia and cannot be easily reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.69,0)">It is therefore better to prevent an “inflation scare" from happening, and not be forced to react to it ex post.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.74,0)">All in all, it is important to monitor inflation expectations, but a central bank should not wait until they move substantially before adjusting rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.34,0)">Otherwise it may be too late and further tightening might be needed to bring inflation expectations back to equilibrium.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.75,0)">In practice, therefore, there is no reason to think that the monetary policy tightening should necessarily stop at some long-term average level of interest rate  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">This will depend inter alia on the position of the economy in the cycle, compared to its potential   and the persistence of inflationary pressures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.52,0)">It is then not surprising that deciding the end of the tightening cycle is as difficult as the start, if not more.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The information problem is typically different at this stage, but no less challenging.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">In addition to the uncertainty on the timing of the cyclical peak and the sustainability of the recovery, there is an even greater one on whether the interest rate is at a level which may be deemed compatible with the maintainance of price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,210.36,0)">This is why the concept of “neutral” and long term equilibrium interest rates, while appealing in theory, are very difficult to use in practice for the implementation of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.52,0)">The uncertainty surrounding the calculation of the “neutral” level of interest rate, in particular at the peak of the cycle, makes this concept very difficult to be made operational.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.02,0)">There is by now a large body of literature on the real-time uncertainty surrounding the neutral and natural level of interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,166.77,0)">Some authors have suggested that central banks should concentrate on the changes in interest rates and forget about the level altogether, given the measurement problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.6,0)">It is certainly true that assessing the key components of the equilibrium real interest rate, in particular productivity growth, is not easy and can lead to persistent policy errors, even if the central bank behaves optimally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.1,0)">In the euro area and in other countries, we have seen persistent forecast errors in growth and inflation, but to date we cannot be sure that such forecast errors derive from problems in measuring potential output growth or from the effects of temporary shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In practice, the end of the tightening cycle will have to remain dependent on the assessment of the underlying and projected economic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.0,0)">These conditions are subject to change, following temporary or more permanent factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.4,0)">It is thus very difficult to preannounce a given interest rate level or a given policy attitude to be followed around the peak of the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">The main guiding factor for interest rate adjustment has to remain the pursue of price stability over the relevant horizon for monetary policy and the anchoring of inflationary expectations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Conclusions Let me conclude by trying to put forward some general lessons that might be learned from the recent experience, which is clearly incomplete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.71,0)">These few comments are obviously non exhaustive and very schematic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">They are presented in a synthetic way and should be considered as input for further discussion and reflection rather than providing any insight on future policy actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">To start tightening: Don't wait too long, especially if the signs of recovery are apparent and interest rates are at very low levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.3,0)">The sooner tightening start, the less tightening might be needed later on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">To be sure, don’t wait to see inflation rising before raising rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,180.1,0)">It will be too late.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Use a wide set of indicators and arguments to explain to market participants and the public at large why tightening is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Money and credit aggregates, asset prices and the level of interest rates might be useful indicators of why the time has come to reduce accommodation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">While tightening: If the strength of the recovery is uncertain, don’t feel compelled to commit to a given path, even if the markets ask for it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(125,255,0)">Keep enough flexibility to be able to accelerate or slow down the tightening, depending on underlying economic conditions without appearing to change the underlying strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Use the same set of indicators mentioned above to explain why the pace of tightening needs to be adapted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">At the end of the tightening: Don’t preannounce when   the tightening will be over, but rather that it will depend on the development of the underlying fundamentals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.94,0)">Be aware that if the tightening is ended too soon, interest rates might have to remain at a high level for some time, even as the economy slows down.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Monitor inflation expectations carefully, but do not wait until they rise before increasing interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">All in all, independently of the state of the tightening cycle, it is always important that market participants and the public at large have a clear understanding of the overall strategy that underlies monetary policy and of the analytical framework that leads to policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.01,0)">They should also understand the uncertainties underlying economic developments throughout the cycle, that complicate the decision making process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Agents should ideally be able to forecast the policy action of the central bank on the basis of the flow of information that they receive and of their understanding of the central bank strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">These are the foundation of a predictable and credible monetary policy.</span>
