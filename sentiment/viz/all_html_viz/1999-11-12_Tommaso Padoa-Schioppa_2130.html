    <h2> With a transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Mr. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, and Mr. Esko Ollila, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Finland, Helsinki, 12 November 1999 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)"> ECB press conference following the Helsinki seminar on the EU accession process With a transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Mr. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, and Mr. Esko Ollila, Deputy Governor of the Bank of Finland, Helsinki, 12 November 1999 Mr. Ollila: Ladies and gentlemen, good afternoon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I am Esko Ollila, the Deputy Governor of the Bank of Finland, which was one of the two institutions responsible for arranging this seminar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.65,0)">The other was the European Central Bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Before I introduce Mr. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa to you, let me just add a couple of items of more or less technical nature to the press release you have already been given.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">I just want to stress that around 50 high-level central bankers , from the level of either Governor or Deputy Governor, took part in this unique and historical conference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">More than 30 speeches, statements or presentations that had been prepared in advance were delivered and were followed by detailed and very lively discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">I am sure that Mr. Padoa-Schioppa will comment further a little later on the success of the conference, but my own assessment is that it was a very successful and the eager participation confirmed that there was a genuine need for a conference such as this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In a moment, Mr. Padoa-Schioppa will tell you about it in greater detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Let me now introduce Mr. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, who is currently a member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, of which Sirkka Hämäläinen is also a member.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Ms Hämäläinen is, I think, known to this audience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.82,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: Actually, I occupy the office in front of hers so we see each other all the time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Mr. Ollila: Mr. Padoa-Schioppa came to the European Central Bank from the post of Chairman of Consob, which is, if I have understood correctly, the security trade supervisory authority in Italy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Before that he held a high-level post as Deputy Director General at the Banca dï¿½Italia, where he had previously worked on several occasions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">And before that he had had a remarkable career as Director-General for Economic and Financial Affairs at the European Commission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">One of the remarkable things which has made Mr. Padoa-Schioppa a familiar figure not only to central bankers ï¿½ or perhaps I should say to regular bankers ï¿½ throughout the world is that he has chaired many important committees such as the Banking Advisory Committee and the Working Group on Payment Systems, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the European Committee of IOSCO.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Indeed, he has provided an extensive service beyond his regular work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">He has held many posts in various working groups elsewhere and the list of his publications ï¿½ both articles and essays ï¿½ is very impressive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Well, ladies and gentlemen, meet Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: Many Thanks, Esko.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">However, this press conference has not been organised in order for me to introduce myself but to present the seminar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">First, I should like to thank Esko Ollila in particular and, more generally, the Bank of Finland for organising this seminar here in Helsinki.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.58,0)">It is a European Central Bank   seminar, but it was organised and hosted by the Central Bank of Finland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">It was really perfectly organised and for that we are most grateful to Esko, with whom we discussed and prepared this meeting for several months before it actually took place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">As Mr. Ollila has told you, the seminar was attended by some 50 high-level central bankers, of which half came from the central banks of the EU accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">As you will know, 12 countries have the official status of "candidates for accession".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.17,0)">The other half of the attendees were from the central banks of the Eurosystem and the ECB, including board members or deputy governors of all the national central banks of the 11 countries in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">I think that this was probably the first time that a meeting of this kind has taken place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">It was certainly the first time since the ECB was established but was probably the first time ever.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">By that I mean a high-level meeting ï¿½ at governor level ï¿½ especially devoted to the problems of central banking in the EU accession process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">We at the ECB, and in particular the Governing Council, felt that it was time for the Eurosystem to become actively involved in the EU accession process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">We had already had extensive contact of various kinds at various levels with the national central banks of those countries which are "candidates for accession", but never a structured, organised meeting such as this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">In the year and a half since the European Central Bank was established, we can count something like 50 or 60 occasions of contact ï¿½ visits to the ECB by representatives of the national central banks or visits that we at the ECB have made.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">So there is already a very intense network of contacts in operation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">The purpose of the seminar today was to start working together in a systematic way in view of accession, to review all the main problems in the field of the competence of central banks, and to start defining our positions with respect to these problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The seminar was preceded by very intense preparatory work to this end, including discussions at the policy level by the Governing Council of the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.34,0)">Why hold a seminar at this stage?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">For two reasons: first, because the involvement of the accession countries in areas of relevance to monetary policy and central banking has already started and will not start only when they become members of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Second, because membership itself has to be prepared ï¿½ not only in terms of the negotiations of each accession country, which are not part of our task, but also ï¿½ and this is of equal importance ï¿½ in the preparation of the monetary system, the setting-up of the financial structure that is required for the accession countries to become full members of the European Union, the definition of policies, and also with regard to organisational or institutional aspects, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">the degree of independence of the national central bank, the preparation of statistics, the setting-up of the payment systems, and so on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.25,0)">This seminar did not have the objective of taking decisions or of reaching agreements but simply of reviewing the problems and identifying the main ones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The press release that has been issued to you summarises the points that emerged from the discussions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">I would like to draw particular attention to the points that are marked with bullets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">First, that central banks have a crucial interest in the timely adoption and implementation of the "acquis communitaire" within their fields of competence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.87,0)">You probably know what the "acquis communitaire" means, "acquis" being a French word meaning "what has been acquired", namely the body of existing arrangements, legislation, Treaty provisions, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">which have to be implemented within the country in order for it to be ready for accession to the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Although much of this body of laws and policies has no direct link to central banking, it is still very relevant for the ECB, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">that a well functioning market economy is set in place with the appropriate legislation, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Finland went through this process not so long ago.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Second, "nominal and real convergence" should be pursued in parallel with the process of bringing legislation into line with the "acquis communitaire".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">We call "real convergence" the process of economic catching-up by these countries in terms of living standards and the structure of their economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">We call "nominal convergence" the compliance with price stability and the achievement of sound public finances and should like to stress that there is no conflict between these two processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(205,255,0)">In fact, they can proceed in parallel ï¿½ as the historical experience of many countries has already shown.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Third, fundamental for all central banks is, of course, the pursuit of price stability as the key element of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.87,0)">Fourth, and this fourth point is probably the most delicate for many of these countries, is: What exchange rate policies should these countries adopt?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">We have seen a wide variety of approaches in the 12 candidate countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Some have a currency board, which means that, so to speak, they have already "adopted" the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.88,0)">Some have a floating currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.52,0)">Others have a peg, and others still a crawling peg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">There are many ways to paradise, but it is very important for these countries to manage finding the specific path for it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">All these small open economies need to have exchange rate references and guidance as to the kind of policy that should be followed in this field.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Fifth, a well functioning banking and financial market is also important as an integral part of getting ready for participation in the single market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">We have had a very intense three days, with three half-day sessions, many speakers, and many exchanges of views.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">We have got to know each other.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">This seminar was, I think, greatly appreciated and the intention is to hold a similar seminar next year in Vienna; an invitation has already been extended by the Oesterreichische Nationalbank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In the meantime, there will certainly be technical meetings in the various fields that were reviewed during the seminar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.36,0)">The seminar was opened by President Duisenberg and Governor Vanhala on Wednesday evening and ended today at 12.30 p.m.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">In my view, it has been a clear success and we are happy to have met in Finland on this occasion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.94,0)">Transcript of the questions asked and the answers given by Mr. Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa and Mr. Esko Ollila Question: Mr. Padoa-Schioppa, what about those accession countries whose exchange rates are not compatible with the Eurosystem?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.72,0)">When will they have to change their regimes?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.41,0)">On the accession date, before that date or on a later agreed date?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.39,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: There is no complete answer to this question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.51,0)">First, the accession countries have some years to go ï¿½ we do not know exactly how many ï¿½ before they become members of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.89,0)">In the immediate future their main problem is to define an exchange rate regime which suits their macroeconomic needs and their economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Once they become members of the EU, they have the option to join ERM II soon after accession or a little later, depending on the condition of their economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">I would say that your question becomes relevant only at that point in time because ERM II is an exchange rate regime.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.0,0)">If they adopt that regime they will abandon regimes that they may have followed previously, such as a floating or a crawling peg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">We did not discuss this exhaustively during the seminar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">More discussion was devoted to the kind of exchange rate policies that are suitable at present and in the near future, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.35,0)">before accession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.34,0)">Question: Which policies were discussed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Which policies were considered to be the best before accession?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: With regard to present exchange rates policies I think that the features highlighted during the seminar can be summarised as follows: first, there is a very wide variety of regimes in operation today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Countries such as Estonia and Bulgaria have already adopted a euro related currency board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.61,0)">There is also a currency board that is not related to the euro, but to the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.48,0)">Then there are countries which have floating rates and countries which have a crawling peg.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">What is striking is that these varieties co-exist with a common core of objectives ï¿½ low inflation and stable macroeconomic conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Thus one could say that there is no single choice or single solution which is the best.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.55,0)">Also countries that formed the EMS in 1979 and were part of it throughout the 1980s did not all have it the same way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">However, I would also say that the accession countries have one major problem in common ï¿½ and this is perhaps why there is such a variety of regimes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.57,0)">That is the problem of capital mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">All the accession countries are already implementing a regime of more or less pronounced capital mobility, but in any event certainly more pronounced than, say, capital mobility in France or Italy in 1979 or for most of the 1980s.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.81,0)">Their exchange rate regime has to take this additional difficulty into account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">This is why some countries go for very tight systems such as a currency board, while others go for a very flexible system such as floating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.49,0)">The reason for this is that in a regime of full mobility of capital it may be very difficult to adopt a mid-way position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.05,0)">Question: Is it too early to say absolutely whether the countries with a currency board will necessarily have to adopt ERM II?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Would it not be possible for them to maintain the currency board?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.03,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: Well, I think quite frankly that the answer is: Yes, it is too early.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me explain why: the Treaty is clear in saying that two yearsï¿½ membership of the ERM is required for admission to EMU and adoption of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.08,0)">This cannot change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.8,0)">The Treaty, as you know, speaks of the exchange rate mechanism and makes no distinction between ERM I and ERM II because when the Treaty was written ERM II did not exist.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.14,0)">However, it is clear now that the relevant clause of the Treaty has to be read as referring to the ERM that we have now, which is ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.59,0)">A currency board is something that did not basically exist in Europe in the 1980s , when the Treaty was conceived.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Like some people see, a currency board may be considered as a peg with zero fluctuation band.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">We know that within ERM I, and even within ERM II, there may be especially narrow fluctuation bands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">For instance, today two countries, Denmark and Greece, with two currencies and two different bands, are members of ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.32,0)">If one follows this logic one could view a currency board as something that is, so to speak, within an ERM as a special additional constraint.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">However, one can also view a currency board as a regime that is different and an alternative to a peg such as ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.62,0)">At this point in time, the debate about the answer to your question has not really started and is in fact envisaged as taking place at a fairly distant time from now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">The debate will become relevant after accession and when those countries which now have a currency board join ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.73,0)">I think it is correct to say that a complete examination of the issue does not yet exist and this is why, as you have rightly said, it is too early to give an answer today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.02,0)">Question: What are the biggest demands of the Eurosystem?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.27,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: I am not sure that I understand the question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.19,0)">Question: ... the biggest demands that the Eurosystem, the European System of Central Banks will face as a result of this enlargement of the EU, or the inclusion of the 12 countries?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: Well, the primary task of the Eurosystem is to pursue and maintain price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">To the extent to which these countries approach the EU family, but not yet join EMU, there is no special demand, to use your word, which is related to that primary task because we simply have to carry on with our own task of preserving price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">However, if we look at the Eurosystem in a more complete way and take note of the fact that the Eurosystem is the central bank of the euro, just as the Federal Reserve System is the central bank of the US dollar, then there is a whole range of issues that are relevant to the Eurosystem, in respect of which co-operation with these countries has to start in view of accession, and has effectively now started.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.59,0)">The topics are those which I listed earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.98,0)">They range from the definition of the institutional position of the central bank to the preparation of the financial system, the pursuit of macroeconomic stability, and more technical tasks in the field of statistics, payment systems, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">I think that in a way, in the immediate future, this is the biggest area of work.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We are here to discuss and co-operate with central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Question: Before the euro was launched some of the countries that are members made some last minute efforts to comply with the framework for the criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.63,0)">Was this seminar organised with a view to the ECBï¿½s preventing this from happening next time?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: No.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In the monetary field, as seen from the point of view of the Eurosystem, accession has three plus one aspects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The first aspect is becoming a member of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The second aspect is becoming a member of ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The third aspect is becoming a member of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">And the "plus one aspect" is what happens even before countries become members of the European Union ï¿½ in other words, what is happening now in terms of preparation, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Of these four aspects, joining the euro area ï¿½ and this implies meeting the criteria ï¿½ is chronologically the most distant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">It is what will come last.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.13,0)">So this was not really a major topic for discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Question: How do you describe the role of the euro in the accession countries today?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And after 2002, when we have the currency in use?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.17,0)">How many euro are circulating in the 12 countries?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.71,0)">And what role, official or unofficial, does the euro already have in eastern Europe?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: If the euro is the intended denomination it, of course, already plays a role in the accession countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">For instance, many of these countries use the euro very widely as a denomination of their public debt or their issues of securities, both by private and public institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Many of these countries have a banking system which has a large proportion of branches or subsidiaries of foreign banks and even in which some of the local traditional banks, when they were privatised, went into the ownership of foreign banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">There is therefore a strong link in the financial structure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Two of these countries, as I have said, have a currency board that relates the currency to the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(103,255,0)">The role of the euro is probably bound to develop even further and I think that in many of these countries the euro will be the natural reference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">However, if you refer to banknotes in particular, then I imagine ï¿½ but this is a personal point of view ï¿½ that, to the extent to which these countries achieve low inflation, the need to have a parallel circulation of a foreign currency ï¿½ which is a better way to preserve the value of your cash ï¿½ will diminish.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">That kind of phenomenon is, I think, not so likely to occur in these 12 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">We know that it is very widespread, for instance, in the Balkans or in other parts of central and eastern Europe, which have greater currency instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Even in those same countries, I remember that 20 years ago in Poland there was a situation of the use of half-dollars because the dollar was circulating so widely that they printed ï¿½ so to speak ï¿½ in a practical way the change for a dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.74,0)">Now, these kind of phenomena, which are the signs of deep monetary disorder within the national currency, have greatly diminished or disappeared in all the accession countries, as the latter have been successful in achieving improved currency stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">So, if things continue to evolve in this way, I do not think that the banknotes will play such a big role as they do in crisis countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.57,0)">Question: Do you have any picture or idea of how many banknotes of the euro currencies are circulating in eastern Europe today or what the demand for them is?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Because the Deutsche Bundesbank, for instance, has calculated that the demand runs to tens of billions of Deutsche Mark.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.57,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: I must confess, I do not remember the figures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">There are, of course, estimates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.89,0)">Most of them relate to Deutsche Mark banknotes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">I think there are estimates probably more for the general circulation of Deutsche Mark than on a country by country basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.7,0)">However, I cannot give a figure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.62,0)">Question: Does this enlargement mean any changes in the General Council?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: First, this was not a topic covered in this seminar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Second, as far as I am aware, it is not a subject that has been discussed so far in relation to the institutional implications of the enlargement of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Letï¿½s say that everyone knows, of course, that one of the adjustments that are necessary when enlargement comes, is to adapt the EU bodies ï¿½ e.g., the number of Commissioners, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.88,0)">ï¿½ and when that moment comes the General Council of the ESCB may also have to be adjusted, but this has not yet been discussed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.85,0)">Question: Did you have any impression that there is a difference in the expectations of the candidate countries and of the EU on the expected timing of adoption of the euro?.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">What do they think about getting into ERM II and Monetary Union?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.9,0)">Do the accession countries have any kind of schedule in mind??</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: Well, these are 12 countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.4,0)">We did not check one-by-one the answer to your question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">So I can report to you just my impression from contacts I have had, even independently of the seminar of yesterday and today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">First, so far six of these 12 countries are so-called first-wave and six are so-called second-wave countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.47,0)">We know that this distinction is now being questioned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,198.64,0)">It may be that it will even be abandoned at the European Council meeting here in Helsinki in December, if one reads the press.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.0,0)">We do not know whether this will be the case or not.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">In fact, we invited all of the 12 countries because, for us, all of them have the status of "recognised candidates".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.89,0)">I would then say that the timing may not be the same for all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.76,0)">It will depend on how negotiations proceed and there may in fact be waves, not in the negotiations but in the actual accession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">I would say that several of these countries have more or less the following positions: they hope that accession will come early.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Because it is an important catalyst of positive change in the countries ï¿½ and some of them even feel that they have already made substantial progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">Just to give you an example ï¿½ some of these countries state that the proportion of their GDP that is produced by the private sector is already higher than that of some of the countries which are members of the European Union now; that the proportion of their banking systems that has been privatised is higher than the proportion of the banking system that is in private ownership in some of the member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This does not mean, of course, that they are ready in every aspect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">But it means that they have a good claim on some important aspects, that they can say that their preparation is well under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">And in any event, membership would not come before some years in which further progress should be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">So first, accession should come early.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.83,0)">I am reporting their position.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.78,0)">I want to be careful.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Second, many of them probably hope that, although accession cannot and will not entail membership in ERM II and/or EMU according to a pre-set timetable, some of these countries hope that these further steps toward the euro should not be postponed to an indefinite future after accession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">But they should themselves have a sequence over a not-too-long time-horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,128.3,0)">On the other hand, it is true that many of these countries recognise that they will start with an economy which has standards of living and price levels that are significantly lower than for the rest of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.78,0)">And that their economic development will probably bring about gains in productivity and also increases in prices that may make too early a fixing of the exchange rate ï¿½ or even the irrevocable fixing via EMU ï¿½ problematic in some respects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.88,0)">So, there are these kind of ï¿½ I would almost say ï¿½ conflicting considerations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.49,0)">Question: Two quick questions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.59,0)">One is about the IMF Presidentï¿½s jobï¿½ Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: I will not take any question outside the subject for which I am here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.12,0)">Question: The other question is really about the quality of the statistical data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,56.13,0)">Now, it is said that Greece has major problems and that that is one reason that it has not been brought into the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.69,0)">What is the perception and the discussion about the quality of statistical data in these countries?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Mr. Padoa-Schioppa: Well, this seminar was a seminar at the level of Governors in which we covered many, many topics ï¿½ including statistical data ï¿½ in three half days.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">We gave an assessment of what we are doing and what the preparatory work entails.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.26,0)">But, quite frankly, we did not have on this occasion the time to review the state of play country-by-country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">We know that this is one of the basic tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.24,0)">By the way, it is not only a Eurosystem/ECB problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.45,0)">It is part of, say, the "acquis", also outside the field of central banks, national accounts or other bits of the sort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">So, I cannot give you a precise answer, but this is certainly one of the fields in which a lot of work still needs to be done.</span>
