    <h3> Speaker: Jürgen Stark </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.59,0)"> Economic situation and fiscal challenges Speech by Jürgen Stark, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Forecaster Club of New York,New York, 2 December 2011 As the ECB's Governing Council meets on Thursday next week, we are now in the pre-decision period and nothing that I say should in any way be interpreted in terms of future monetary policy decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(148,255,0)">Introduction Thank you very much for the invitation to speak today to this distinguished audience at the Forecasters Club here in New York.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.51,0)">Large parts of Europe are suffering from the ongoing sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.02,0)">An increasing number of sovereigns are facing financing problems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">A solution needs to be found urgently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.98,0)">But fingers are pointing in different directions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">In my view solving the current sovereign debt crisis is primarily in the hands of governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.06,0)">Its root cause lies in lax fiscal policies and associated deteriorating public finances in some euro area countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.21,0)">Stability criteria were violated, fiscal rules ignored and statistics tweaked.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Growth dividends were not used for necessary consolidation in good times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.7,0)">In the same vein, competitiveness positions worsened in many euro area countries, due to a lack of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.69,0)">These developments have raised doubts in financial markets on the political will and capacity to live up to their commitments and to do whatever is needed to comply with the rules of the game within a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">To solve the crisis requires determined fiscal consolidation and ambitious structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">These must be the prime answers for tackling current challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">At the same time, it has to be recognised that sovereign debt issues are not confined to the euro area but have become an important issue for all advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Thus, I will focus my presentation today on the policy responses to the crisis and the requirements I see as essential in the areas of monetary policy, fiscal policy and structural reforms to cope with current challenges  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Macroeconomic and monetary environment Let me start with briefly sketching the economic and financial developments in the euro area during the years of crisis up to now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.09,0)">Following the collapse of Lehman, financial market tensions escalated in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.57,0)">As a consequence, we witnessed a severe global recession.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.66,0)">After the deep recession that started in 2008, euro area real GDP started to contract and stood in the first half of 2009 about 5% below its level one year earlier, compared to a contraction of the US economy of close to 5% taking into account the recent revisions to US national account data.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Continued strong external demand as well as a strengthening of domestic demand where the main drivers behind the subsequent economic recovery  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,71.86,0)">At present, it seems that some of the downside risks we had identified earlier have been materialising.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Looking ahead, short-term indicators and survey data suggest that real GDP growth may be very moderate towards the end of this year and at the beginning of next year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.18,0)">Indeed, economic activity in the euro area is adversely affected by a moderation in the pace of global demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.66,0)">In addition, the crisis continues to weigh on confidence and financing conditions in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.73,0)">These developments are expected to dampen activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">At the same time, activity should benefit from continued positive economic growth in the emerging market economies, the continued extremely low levels of short-term interest rates and the various measures that have been implemented to support the functioning of the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.55,0)">Having said this, uncertainty remains very high and risks to the economic outlook on the downside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Turning to prices, average inflation in the euro area rose to 1.6% in 2010, and continued increasing in 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.91,0)">It stood at 3% in November, according the Eurostat’s flash estimate, unchanged from previous months, still significantly lower than in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.38,0)">The main drivers behind the elevated inflation rates since the end of last year have been oil and other commodity price surges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">As of late, increases in indirect taxes due to fiscal consolidation needs have been an additional driver.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">At the same time, domestic price pressures have remained moderate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Survey data up to October point to some easing in pipeline pressures, especially at the earlier stages of the pricing chain, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.07,0)">producer prices for intermediate goods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,35.67,0)">In view of the rather weak growth prospects and continued slack in labour markets, labour cost pressures are likely to remain contained in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.64,0)">Looking ahead, euro area inflation rates are likely to decline in the coming months.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.68,0)">They are expected to fall below 2% in the course of 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">In the medium term, inflation rates should remain moderate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">This is in line with latest available inflation forecasts from public sources.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">Medium to longer-term inflation expectations according to both survey and market based measures remain well anchored in line with the ECB’s aim of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.22,0)">As to monetary and credit developments, following double digit growth rates in the build-up of the financial crisis, signalling risks for macroeconomic instabilities and price stability, annual growth in the broad monetary aggregate M3 and in loans to the private sector fell sharply between 2008 and mid-2010  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Since then, money and credit growth started to recover.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(80,255,0)">However, underlying growth trends remained moderate, correcting a sizeable part of the excess liquidity that had been accumulated before the start of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(171,255,0)">Monetary policy The ECB from the very beginning of the crisis has taken decisive and swift action through both its standard and non-standard monetary policy measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.73,0)">In a first response to intensified financial market tensions, and based on our assessment of medium-term risks to price stability in the euro area, we reduced our key interest rates by 325 basis points between October 2008 and May 2009 and kept them unchanged until April 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">During this time, the main refinancing rate of the Eurosystem stood at 1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.2,0)">Over the same period, the overnight money market interest rate   also decreased rapidly, reaching levels as low as 0.3%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">Earlier this year, in April and July, we raised interest rates in two steps, each time by 25 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.97,0)">At that time, we were concerned that prevailing upward price pressures, mainly from energy and commodity prices, could translate into second-round effects in wage and price-setting and to broad-based inflationary pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.57,0)">However, the picture has changed since then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.3,0)">The economic outlook has worsened amidst continued high uncertainty and intensified downside risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.98,0)">In such an environment, it is reasonable to expect moderate price, cost and wage pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,232.98,0)">This assessment has led us to the decision last month to reduce rates by 25 basis points.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Our main refinancing rate therefore now stands at 1.25%, and the rates on the deposit facility and marginal lending facility at 0.75% and 1.75% respectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">At the same time, we have introduced a number of non-standard monetary policy measures, with the aim to support credit flows from banks and thereby ensure that our interest rate is transmitted properly to households and firms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Notably, the design of these measures has taken into account the pivotal role of banks in financing the real economy of the euro area  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">They focused on a proper functioning of the banking sector, by ensuring that funding markets, notably the money market, continued functioning.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The main non-standard monetary policy measure in that context is the full allotment of liquidity demand by banks, at fixed, low rates, against eligible collateral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">In addition, the ECB also engaged in buying government securities via its Securities Markets Programme  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">The Governing Council’s aim of this programme is to restore a proper transmission process that threatened to become impaired given dysfunctional market segments, as witnessed by very high interest rate spreads on sovereign bonds  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">This is a major difference with quantitative easing in other major countries where such bond purchases are conducted in financing governments and against the background of official interest rates being close to the lower zero bound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">The aim of quantitative easing is to have a more accommodative monetary policy stance via lowering long-term interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">By contrast, the ECB’s purchases of bonds aim to ensure that our official short-term interest rates are transmitted in a proper way to the economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Another difference is that the ECB fully sterilises the liquidity injected in the market through its SMP while this is not the case in the US and the UK.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.86,0)">The ECB has much less government securities on its balance sheet than the central banks of the US and the UK  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">To be fair, this difference not only reflects the quantitative easing policy conducted in the UK and the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">In the US, for instance, government bonds already were an important item on the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve before the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.48,0)">The Federal Reserve typically implements its monetary policy through purchases and sales of government bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Let me also emphasise that all the non-standard monetary policy measures taken by the ECB are temporary in nature and complementary, rather than supplementary, to our interest rate instrument.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.53,0)">At the same time, we should not forget the adverse side-effects of interest rates being kept at very low levels for a long time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.07,0)">In fact, the period preceding the start of the financial market tensions in August 2007 is reminiscent of the associated risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.11,0)">Notably, the very low level of global interest rates after 2001 and the resulting ample liquidity conditions at the global level has laid the basis for the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.59,0)">In addition, maintaining very low interests rates for a protracted period may weaken the financial incentive for deleveraging for both the banking and non-financial sectors, and can result in “evergreening” of outstanding loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.76,0)">Very low interest rates may also discourage banks from trading in interbank money markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">This is an important market for the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.15,0)">Related, it has adverse effects on some financial institutions such as money market funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Overall, the combination of standard and non-standard monetary policy measures has been successful in maintaining inflation rates below, but close to, 2% over the medium term, while ensuring the transmission of monetary policy in difficult times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">This is witnessed by fairly stable inflation expectations around ECB’s objective  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">The ECB therefore has delivered fully on its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.93,0)">Unfortunately, that cannot be said of all policymakers involved, resulting in the lingering of the sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">To tackle the crisis decisively first and foremost requires tackling its root cause will require ambitious fiscal policies and structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Fiscal policy Let me now turn to the fiscal situation in the euro area in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.85,0)">The severe imbalances that came to the forefront in the wake of the financial and economic crisis - to a significant extent - are related to past policy mistakes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">In this context, one needs to bear in mind that the euro area neither constitutes a fully-fledged federation nor a political or fiscal union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">While monetary policy is centralised, budgetary sovereignty remains to a large extent at the Member State level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">The Stability and Growth Pact has been put in place to ensure a sufficient degree of fiscal coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">However, this rules-based framework, which is built on peer-pressure, was not sufficient to ensure a smooth functioning of the monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">This calls for a more pronounced transfer of sovereignty to the European level and the move towards a fiscal union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.45,0)">Countries have joined the euro area and benefited from its advantages but some have failed to live up to the responsibilities that are inherent in being part of a monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.72,0)">In particular, many euro area countries failed to achieve sufficiently sound fiscal positions in line with the rules of the European Fiscal Framework in previous economic good times.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.32,0)">This was the consequence of a lax enforcement of the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, notably due to a deficient governance framework at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.79,0)">As a result, many countries already entered the crisis with weak fiscal positions which amplified the fiscal deterioration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In 2010, the aggregate fiscal balance of the euro area stood at more than 6% of GDP up from an almost balanced budget in 2000; euro area debt amounted to more than 85% of GDP in 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.9,0)">Moreover, 14 out of 17 euro area countries are currently facing an excessive deficit procedure related to a budgetary deficit above the 3% of GDP reference value of the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.64,0)">Particularly high deficits exist in the countries subject to EU/IMF programmes, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">in Ireland, Greece and Portugal, but also in some large euro area countries, notably Spain and France.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">As consequence, sizeable and persistent structural adjustment will be necessary in most euro area countries to put debt back on a declining path and reduce it to a sustainable level, in line with the 60% of GDP debt criterion of the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.42,0)">However, most advanced economies face substantial fiscal consolidation requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Notably, for the US, the IMF estimates that general government gross debt will reach 100% of GDP in 2011 and that it will continue to rise through the year 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">At the same time, the general government deficit is expected to remain close to 10% of GDP in 2011   As you can see from the slide, significant aggregate structural adjustment of 1 percentage-point of GDP per year will be necessary in the euro area to reduce the debt ratio to below 60% of GDP by 2030.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">For the US, even such a relatively ambitious adjustment path would keep the debt-to-GDP at around 75% of GDP by 2030.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.54,0)">These scenarios highlight the significant fiscal challenges we are facing on both sides of the Atlantic in the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">In European countries, the correction of excessive deficits is on its way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The pace of fiscal adjustment has been set by the European Council in a way that reflects country-specific imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.7,0)">Most countries will have to reduce their deficit ratio to below 3% of GDP by 2013 at the latest.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Accordingly, euro area Member States have presented medium-term consolidation strategies in their Stability Programmes which point to a strongly expenditure-based adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Such an approach is warranted in view of strong increases in government spending during the crisis in most countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">Moreover, past experience suggests that successful consolidations typically have a strong expenditure component.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In addition, case study evidence from previous consolidation episodes indicates that ambitious expenditure reform was typically carried out in the context of a broader economic reform programmes, comprising structural reforms to promote potential growth and institutional reform, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">to strengthen the budgetary framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">In fact, many euro area countries, notably the ones subject to EU/IMF programmes, are following such a strategy which I would like to call the European approach to fiscal adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">If effectively implemented, such reform programmes would enable countries to address their sustainability risks and, at the same time, limit potential short-term costs of fiscal tightening through growth-enhancing structural reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Especially in the current environment of heightened market sensitivity, ambitious reform efforts should quickly trigger positive confidence effects and be conducive to macroeconomic stabilisation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(109,255,0)">It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that European governments implement the announced fiscal consolidation and reform measures and ensure - by all means - the delivery of agreed fiscal targets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">This will be crucial to regain market confidence, notably in countries with very high and strongly rising debt ratios and pronounced risks related to the expected ageing-related fiscal burden.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">For these countries, with a view to ensuring a sufficiently swift return to sound and sustainable fiscal positions, it appears to be advisable to implement fiscal adjustment beyond what is required to correct excessive deficits and converge towards the medium-term budgetary objective, typically a balanced budget.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Only if national governments strictly adhere to ambitious fiscal consolidation and reform does it make sense to seek ways to buy some time to implement the planned measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">The European Financial Stability Facility is the appropriate vehicle for that but before coming operational European governments need to deliver on their commitment to leverage funds available to this facility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Public programmes should be based on strong conditionality, as otherwise incentives to take the necessary national measures would be weakened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In addition, surveillance mechanisms at the European level need to be strengthened to monitor progress and avoid major derailments in the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.97,0)">Decision-making in crisis times is different in our democratic systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the US, a medium-term fiscal exit strategy has yet to be clearly specified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.46,0)">The bipartisan congressional committee on deficit reduction did not reach an agreement on measures to reduce the public deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.34,0)">At the same time, the recent downgrade of US long-term government debt and rising sovereign CDS spreads signal that no advanced economy is immune to a loss of market confidence in its public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">It is therefore essential for the US to formulate a credible fiscal consolidation programme that returns its government debt to a declining path towards sustainable levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.06,0)">Structural reforms As I mentioned before, deteriorating competitiveness positions in some euro area countries contributed to the current crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">These countries therefore need to restore price and cost competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Apart from labour cost moderation, this calls for structural reforms targeted at removing remaining rigidities in labour and product markets, thereby raising potential economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">The measures should focus on enhancing wage flexibility and increasing competition in product markets, particularly in services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,65.72,0)">However, the need for structural reform does not stop with the euro area countries hit most by the sovereign debt crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">For instance, the US economy would benefit from a more sustainable growth model, where solid and medium-term oriented economic policies strengthen potential growth and job creation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">This would include structural reforms that address weaknesses in the labour market and in particular reduce long-term unemployment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">Policies that stabilise the housing market, such as facilitating refinancing of mortgage debt, would also help households to deleverage and support private consumption in the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Sustainable growth is also enhanced by policies that avoid the build-up of excessive misalignments in asset prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">At a global level, continuing imbalances require ongoing efforts to address factors or policies that foster disequilibrium flows around the globe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Enhancing exchange rate flexibility in emerging economies with large external surpluses would mitigate the risk of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.39,0)">Conclusion The lingering and expanding sovereign debt crisis must be halted to avoid macroeconomic and financial disaster, in the euro area and beyond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,88.07,0)">No country is immune anymore to a loss of market confidence in its public finances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.26,0)">With fiscal imbalances and deteriorating competitiveness in euro area countries at the root of the current crisis, there can in my view be no discussion which policymakers should make a move.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Ambitious fiscal consolidation and structural reforms by national governments in the euro area are required now - or actually, yesterday.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Only if the course of national policies is the right one can an accompanying financing scheme as the EFSF play a useful role to bridge the period when market access remains restricted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(126,255,0)">Monetary policy in the euro area was and will remain an anchor of confidence and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">It will remain dedicated to its mandate of maintaining price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This is the necessary and central contribution that monetary policy can make to fostering sustainable growth, job creation and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">Monetary policy should not be overburdened.</span>
