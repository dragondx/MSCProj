    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.22,0)"> Europe: a work in progress – political integration and economic convergence in Monetary Union Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Banking and Corporate evening organised by the Hauptverwaltung in Bayern der Deutschen Bundesbank, Munich, 22 November 2018 Ladies and gentlemen, Europe has no problem with identifying the issues it faces; it has a problem with implementing solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.54,0)">Many of the weaknesses and shortcomings of the European framework have long been known.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">And the measures required to address these issues have repeatedly been discussed for some time now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.85,0)">Unfortunately, national interests and complacency have consistently dampened the momentum that Europe needs to become a true Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.7,0)">Electoral machinations extending to the regional level and rising populism have recently added to the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">The latest proposal was in June.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">At a meeting in Meseburg Palace, the leaders of France and Germany issued a joint declaration in which they stated their objective “to strengthen and deepen the euro area further, and make it a genuine economic union”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Their statement that sharing the same currency entails specific needs in terms of economic coordination and integration  is correct – and it is something that has long been known.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,79.53,0)">As far back as 1970, the committee of experts chaired by the then Luxembourg Prime Minister Pierre Werner, which drew up the first meaningful plan for a European monetary union, stressed that insufficient economic convergence and the absence of a common fiscal policy would give rise to the need for greater economic policy coordination.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.53,0)">Later proposals, including the Maastricht Treaty of 1992, unfortunately failed to sufficiently tackle the inherent tensions of a currency without a state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The spirit of Meseberg stems from the original European idea and the pledge of prosperity that brought the single currency into being: the euro benefits Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">They profit from having a credible and stable currency and a larger, competitive market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">But the crisis demonstrated that the euro area is susceptible to negative shocks and that greater economic and political convergence is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Today, I would like to focus on three areas in which it is vital to make progress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">First, we have to more actively pursue fiscal and structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(152,255,0)">Second, we need to further reduce risks and fragmentation in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">And third, we must decisively strengthen the institutional architecture of Economic and Monetary Union  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Structural reforms and fiscal policy Unlike countries that have their own currency, euro area members cannot use the exchange rate to tackle asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Instead, they must undertake structural adjustments to ensure that their economies are competitive and resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.98,0)">If some Member States adjust more slowly than others, economic differences may become permanent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.24,0)">And to the extent that this endangers the effectiveness of monetary policy and the cohesion of the Union, it has potentially damaging consequences for all Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">It is thus vital that Member States push ahead with structural reforms to make labour and product markets more flexible, thereby enabling the factors of production to move more quickly between sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">To this end, national reform requirements are determined in the context of the European semester with a view to strengthening the coordination of economic policies at the EU level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Country-specific recommendations need to be implemented in the interests of all parties to avoid persistent imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.59,0)">But progress in implementing the reforms has been slow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">The European Commission concluded that the overwhelming majority – meaning more than 90% – of country-specific recommendations had only been implemented to “some” or a “limited” extent in 2017, similar to the previous year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The European Commission suggests supporting countries’ reform efforts through the EU budget.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">In principle, this could create positive incentives to implement reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">However, for that to work in practice, the Commission proposal would need to be significantly strengthened in three ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">First, reforms should be selected on the basis of their implications for macroeconomic prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Second, the funding should be distributed on the basis of a quality assessment rather than in proportion to a country’s entitlement to a “slice of the pie”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Third, powerful clawback mechanisms should be built in so that funds could be recuperated if reforms are reversed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">The implementation of structural reforms is only one of the factors that helps strengthen the resilience of Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Another factor is sound fiscal policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Here common fiscal rules are important to ensure that Member States do not take on excessive levels of debt, because low levels of debt and larger buffers give countries greater fiscal space to mitigate economic downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.2,0)">Aggregate debt and deficit ratios in the euro area are currently lower than those in any other major economy, which demonstrates that our common fiscal rules are having a certain effect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.2,0)">But the rules have repeatedly been called into question in recent months, in particular by countries with high levels of debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.91,0)">To this one can only say that consistently breaching the rules will not only make them less effective in the long run, it could also worsen financing conditions for some or all Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">It is thus imperative that countries, especially those with the highest debt levels, use the ongoing expansion to build up fiscal buffers and reduce debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">This is not only crucial to strengthen resilience, it is also a precondition for strengthening the solidarity between Member States in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">As such, the Meseburg declaration represents a turning point, as the German government is now recognising the need, in principle, for a stabilisation facility at the European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The recent proposal for an EU unemployment insurance scheme put forward by the German finance minister, Olaf Scholz, is also to be welcomed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The fund, which the Member States would pay into, would grant loans to particularly crisis-stricken social security systems, without any transfer payments taking place.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">In addition, the European Commission is proposing a European investment stabilisation function to mitigate large asymmetric shocks in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">And a few days ago, France and Germany agreed on a proposal for a limited euro area budget by 2021.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Two elements are essential for the effectiveness of such instruments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">First, a central fiscal capacity should be designed to increase the euro area’s ability to counter severe area-wide recessions, thereby supporting monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Second, it should set appropriate incentives for sound fiscal and economic policymaking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.82,0)">On both counts, the proposals made so far fall short.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">They are limited in size and designed to counter asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,122.94,0)">However, asymmetric shocks are extremely rare, and there is a lack of analytical concepts and normative answers to help distinguish between difficulties affecting a country through no fault of its own   and those that are the result of the wrong economic policy choices  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">What’s more, existing EU Treaty provisions already allow for financial assistance to a Member State threatened with severe difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.35,0)">In addition, the proposals do not sufficiently counteract moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The recent Franco-German proposal takes some of these issues into account, for example by suggesting that the euro area budget only be made available to countries that fully respect the European framework, including the fiscal rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">It also explicitly states the aim of fostering competitiveness and economic convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.82,0)">At the same time, any attempt to set up an intergovernmental decision-making structure to manage a federal sub-budget is likely to be difficult to implement in practice, and the effectiveness of a financial transaction tax as the central source of funding is overrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(92,255,0)">However, I don’t want to pick too many holes in the idea – indeed, I warmly welcome the fact that the European debate is picking up speed again.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Reducing risks and fragmentation in the financial sector Let me now turn to the second set of challenges faced by the euro area: risks in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.87,0)">The financial crisis demonstrated that an unstable and highly fragmented financial sector represents an existential threat to Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Europe has translated key lessons of the crisis into a more solid framework by establishing the banking union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.68,0)">The euro area’s largest banks are now supervised at the EU level and their failure is addressed centrally.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">The improved regulatory and supervisory framework has allowed considerable progress to be made in terms of reducing risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of large banks has increased from 9.7% in 2008 to over 14% today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Leverage ratios have risen from 3.7% to 5.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">And banks have much more stable liquidity and funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.71,0)">At the same time, insufficient progress has been made in creating a European banking market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.59,0)">Euro area banks largely operate in their home markets, leading to overcapacity and making the Union more susceptible to fragmentation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Fragmentation along national lines and overcapacity are also visible at the aggregate European level if we compare some key figures for the sector with those of other currency areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.35,0)">From 2013 to 2017, the average return on equity for the euro area banking sector was 4.5%, while it was 9% in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.41,0)">Over the same period, European banks had a cost/income ratio of 69%, while that of US banks was just 60%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The euro area had 44 bank branches for every 100,000 inhabitants, almost twice as many as in the United States, which had 26.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.51,0)">In the euro area, only 52% of banks’ total assets are publicly traded, while the figure is close to 80% in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">An integrated financial market offers risk-sharing mechanisms that can be used to mitigate country-specific shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Banks that have more geographically diversified loan and deposit portfolios are more resilient to local shocks and can keep their lending activity more stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">We must hence continue enhancing the conditions for cross-border banking in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.69,0)">The first step is to reduce the legacy non-performing loans on banks’ balance sheets which have hampered cross-border lending and M&A transactions over the past few years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">That would then pave the way for the completion of the banking union, which we need to reinforce in order to boost confidence in the resilience of the whole financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.47,0)">Financial market fragmentation may be exacerbated by perceived or actual differences between the national safety nets for banks which undermine the banks’ capability and willingness to expand their cross-border activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">The introduction of a common and credible fund for the Single Resolution Mechanism   would inspire confidence that banks can be resolved more efficiently, regardless of their location.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Likewise, the creation of a European deposit insurance scheme   would enhance depositor confidence throughout the euro area and create a level playing field for banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">The main benefit of EDIS is that it will generate confidence in the financial system as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Provided that the standards on minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities  , total loss-absorbing capacity   or other risk reduction measures are not eroded, EDIS will probably never be deployed at all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.81,0)">At the same time, we should not fail to mention that especially smaller institutions have next to no experience in accessing capital market funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.18,0)">This makes it more difficult to rigorously apply the MREL requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">Moreover, the introduction of such security mechanisms at European level could give national governments less incentive to restrict the free flow of capital and liquidity; this would in turn promote cross-border activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">But EDIS must be incentive-compatible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Its introduction must not result in any retrospective sharing of the burden of legacy non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">And in order to avoid systematic transfers between banking sectors, the banks’ contributions to the fund should be structured to reflect banks’ risk appetites.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Strengthening the institutional architecture of Economic and Monetary Union These economic and fiscal reforms are essential in order to make the euro area more resilient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">However, they cannot fully prevent the risk of severe economic shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">In the future too, effective crisis management will be indispensable to protect the Member States from serious imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">In this respect, I am very much in favour of strengthening the European Stability Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">However, the reorientation of the ESM should be coupled with its integration into EU law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.94,0)">If the ESM were to remain an intergovernmental institution, any transfer of tasks must be consistent with the allocation of responsibilities between the EU and its Member States as laid down in EU law, as a transfer of powers from the European level   to the intergovernmental level   would amount to a throwback to national models and self-interests.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.94,0)">By analogy, this also applies to a Euro area budget.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">We also need more clarity with regard to the political framework for Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">We must identify problems with countries’ debt sustainability at an earlier stage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The ESM needs to be able to distinguish between liquidity and solvency problems early on.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">That would allow us to pick up the can early rather than kicking it down the road.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">Similarly, we need to do more to break the bank-sovereign nexus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.68,0)">We need regulatory instruments to curb the excessive accumulation of sovereign risks on bank balance sheets without triggering market disruptions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">In that sense, ensuring the adequate regulatory treatment of sovereign risk and facilitating orderly debt restructuring are two sides of the same coin.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.85,0)">We should be aware that market-imposed discipline often comes suddenly, creates cliff-edge effects and can have negative consequences for financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">The recent Franco-German proposal to introduce single-limb collective action clauses and moves to align the roles of the ESM and the International Monetary Fund in debt restructuring negotiations are sensible first steps towards creating a more reliable framework for orderly debt restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This brings me to my final point: democratic control.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">Progress in completing Economic and Monetary Union needs to evolve in lock-step with appropriate democratic control to meet the test of constitutionality.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">What matters is that liability and control are aligned.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">When taxpayers’ money is involved at European level, a European control function is called for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.98,0)">Any confusion over the assignment of responsibilities and accountability arrangements threatens the efficiency and legitimacy of European measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.43,0)">The task is complicated by the particular architecture of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.48,0)">The distinction between the euro area and the EU means that it is more difficult to fully tailor accountability to euro area tasks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.65,0)">In particular, the European Parliament does not sit in euro area composition when discussing euro area matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.33,0)">And of course it leaves a sour taste when representatives of countries that neither belong to the euro area, nor will remain in the EU in the long term, actively fill central positions in the European Parliament or its committees.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">At the same time, responsibilities and accountability also need to be proportionate in areas of shared competence between the EU and Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">This holds true for the ESM and for fiscal policies, where the situation is more complex and blurred.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.64,0)">The ESM, for example, was created on the basis of intergovernmental arrangements and for tasks where the EU only has a coordination role, and where the European Parliament is not yet a counterpart in terms of accountability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">We need to strike a balance here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">On the one hand, accountability should be assigned to national parliaments for decisions that are fully in the hands of national authorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">On the other hand, the ESM needs to be equipped with swift and credible decision-making procedures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.45,0)">This will never be fully possible in an intergovernmental setting that is hampered by national vetoes and operates outside the constitutional safeguards of the acquis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Against this backdrop, the ESM should be turned into a body that is governed by EU law and is accountable to the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">This would ensure that the ESM is better placed to act in the sole interest of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">A similar logic, necessitating Treaty change, must be applied in any further discussions regarding a euro area fiscal capacity and the possible introduction of an EU investment facility or a European finance minister.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">If a euro area budget is established, it should be part of an ongoing debate on a euro area finance ministry and a euro area composition of the European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.2,0)">We should avoid undermining established Union methods.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,120.67,0)">This also holds true for parallel financial structures aiming to bring separate funds under the same umbrella, in case they would hamper the efficiency of established federal institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.42,0)">We should neither succumb to the appeal of relying on secondary legislation in areas where primary law is unambiguous, nor use semantic tricks to subjugate the letter and spirit of the Treaty to secondary legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">The central bank must keep its distance from politics rather than constantly pushing its way into new fields of action under cover of financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Conclusions The euro area is a special construct.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">19 countries share a common currency, but responsibility for their economic and fiscal policies still lies in national hands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Convergence in these areas is, however, crucial for the success of Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">So it is imperative for all Member States to adhere to the common rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">The resilience of the euro hinges on the implementation of the necessary economic and fiscal reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(46,255,0)">And further steps must be taken to boost private and public risk-sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">At the same time, as we progress towards completing Economic and Monetary Union, we should keep in mind two principles that are at the heart of effective policy in a democratic society.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">First, liability and control must be aligned, with important decisions taken only by those who will bear their consequences.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Second, the discharge of democratic control must lie at the level at which policy decisions are taken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Given the current state of our Economic and Monetary Union, further efforts to deepen it through political and economic convergence are clearly indispensable.</span><span
