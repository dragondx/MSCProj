    <span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)"> Digital na ive?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.83,0)">Fintechs and the future of banking Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at an ECB Fintech Workshop, Frankfurt, 27 March 2017 We will never know who did it and when exactly it was done – all of that is lost in the mists of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.39,0)">But about 4,000 years ago, one of our ancestors invented the wheel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It was one of the most important inventions in the entire history of humanity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Ever since, our lives have been shaped by innovations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Some of these innovations have made our life better – just think of vaccines or the telephone.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.97,0)">Others have had more ambivalent impact – think of nuclear power.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.53,0)">In any case, it is always hard to guess where an innovation will take us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.56,0)">And it is all too easy to get it wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">As the President of IBM said in 1943: “I think there is a world market for maybe five computers.” He got it wrong, it seems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.49,0)">And so did Robert Metcalfe in 1995.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.54,0)">As the founder of a tech company, he predicted that “the internet will soon go spectacularly supernova and in 1996 catastrophically collapse.” The internet did not collapse.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Instead, it has changed our lives.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.42,0)">Could you live without the internet?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.86,0)">Could you live without a mobile phone?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Our entire life has become digital, and this includes the way we do banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Fintech, as it is known, seems to be the next big thing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It’s true that, in continental Europe, fintechs still account for just a small share of the markets for banking, payment services and asset management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(63,255,0)">Still, over the past years, they have received a lot of attention and a lot of funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(70,255,0)">Fintechs are on the rise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">They have entered the markets, and they are competing with banks – at least in some parts of the value chain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.52,0)">The question is: where will this innovation take us?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,224.76,0)">Is it the end of banking as we know it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Will it create new risks?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.29,0)">As I said before, it is hard to guess how innovations will evolve and easy to get it wrong.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">That said, let us take a very brief look at some potential futures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(84,255,0)">Scenario one: banks might embrace the digital trend and team up with fintechs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,205.79,0)">For banks this would be one of the more benign outcomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And it seems to be happening right now.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.54,0)">Scenario two: fintechs might break up the value chain of banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.96,0)">Banks would end up losing revenue, market share and direct contact with clients.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,196.97,0)">The result might be a more fragmented market where some players operate outside the scope of regulation and supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,25.8,0)">Scenario three: banks might still end up being crowded out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.55,0)">At the same time, however, the fintechs could be swallowed up by big tech companies, such as Google, Amazon and Facebook.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The market would become more concentrated, less competitive and less diversified.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.22,0)">Whichever direction we are headed, there is one thing we supervisors worry about: increasing or unidentified risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(132,255,0)">And there are indeed some risks that have become more apparent now that fintechs have entered the scene.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">A basic truth is that new players make the market more competitive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.98,0)">And that could squeeze profits and force banks to cut costs in areas such as risk management.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,226.47,0)">This is a general concern we have.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.32,0)">At the same time, bank funding might become less stable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">New products, tools and services enable depositors to easily and quickly switch banks; they can select a better offer in a heartbeat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.94,0)">For banks, deposits might become a less reliable and more costly source of funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">With regard to lending, we are also seeing new trends such as peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.16,0)">Here, savers and borrowers interact directly – banks no longer serve as middlemen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">As these new businesses grow, risks associated with traditional banking might emerge – just think of the risks from maturity and liquidity transformation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Some peer-to-peer lenders are already securitising the loans they originate from their platforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,150.39,0)">Regulators will need to deal with the resulting vulnerabilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The work on shadow banking done by the Financial Stability Board and the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision might serve as a basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Some fintechs also apply new models for scoring the quality of loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">These models are based on vast amounts of data and are supposed to be more precise than traditional approaches.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.63,0)">But they have hardly ever been tested in a severe recession or a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.57,0)">So we don’t know how well they would work in such situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In respect of asset management, new products such as robo-advice are now appearing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">These are computer programmes that advise customers on how to invest their money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.43,0)">Depending on their design, they might lead many investors to take the same positions at the same time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.67,0)">Such herding could then enforce current trends, creating bubbles or bursting them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.4,0)">And then there are threats of a more technical kind: cyber risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,156.21,0)">Cyber risks affect everyone – banks, fintechs and their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.09,0)">Arguably, fintechs are more exposed to cyberattacks and data theft.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.14,0)">Their IT platforms are small and interconnected, and they often use public cloud solutions and outsource data storage.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">That said, fintechs are digital natives and are very aware of the risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Ladies and gentlemen, it is hard to predict where the fintech journey will take us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.53,0)">It is obvious, however, that the train has left the station and is speeding up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">Customers want to extend their digital life to banking; they want banking services anytime and anywhere.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Those who can satisfy their needs will become dominant players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">There is a chance that fintechs will deeply transform the banking business.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">It is up to regulators and supervisors to ensure that this does not come at the cost of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.79,0)">The issue is, of course, that fintechs often operate outside the regulated banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">With that in mind, policymakers should follow the general principle of “same business, same risks, same rules”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">That is important.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.71,0)">As banking supervisors, we focus on risks related to banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In that regard, we are working on a number of projects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.55,0)">Take bank licences, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">We see a rising number of applications related to fintechs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(48,255,0)">In response to this, we have teamed up with the national supervisors to work on a joint policy approach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">It will ensure that applications are treated in the same manner across the entire euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">Risks that are specific to fintechs will be assessed appropriately and proportionately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">We are also seeing more and more supervisors exploring and setting up mechanisms to facilitate the authorisation process for fintech banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Innovation hubs and sandboxes are two of the key words here.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">And we too are seeking to implement a euro area-wide hub for fintechs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.71,0)">We are also assessing the risks that might arise when banks or fintechs outsource data or even entire IT systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">We already carried out some work in this regard; in 2015, we did a cybercrime survey, which was a unique project at the global level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">As a follow-up we implemented a data base to track and analyse cyber incidents in large euro area banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">And last but not least, concerning the business models of banks, we will explore potential risks that emanate from fintechs and other non-bank competitors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In that regard, fintechs are among our supervisory priorities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">We have to closely monitor how fintech evolves and better understand its impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(208,255,0)">Our workshop today serves that goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">It brings together fintechs, banks and supervisors, and it allows us all to share our ideas and experience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">It helps us to shape our supervisory views and limit potential risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">And it helps the financial industry to provide modern and safe financial products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">Such exchanges are vital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">I therefore thank all those who are contributing to this event and all those who made it possible in the first place!</span>
