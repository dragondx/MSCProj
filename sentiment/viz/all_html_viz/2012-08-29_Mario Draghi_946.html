    <span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)"> The future of the euro: stability through change Contribution from Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, Published in "Die Zeit", 29 August 2012 Across Europe, a fundamental debate is taking place about the future of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.81,0)">Many citizens are concerned about where Europe is heading.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.33,0)">Yet the solutions presented appear to them unsatisfactory.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This is because these solutions offer binary choices: either we must go back to the past, or we must move to a United States of Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">My answer to the question is: to have a stable euro we do not need to choose between extremes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.77,0)">The reason this debate is taking place is not the euro as a currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">The objectives of the single currency remain as relevant today as they were when the single currency was agreed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">To spread price stability and sustainable growth to all European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(139,255,0)">To reap the gains of the world’s largest single market and make the historic process of European unification irreversible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(79,255,0)">To raise Europe’s standing – not only economically but also politically – in a globalised world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.02,0)">The debate is taking place because the euro area has not yet fully succeeded as a polity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.42,0)">Currencies ultimately depend on the institutions that stand behind them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">When the euro was first proposed, there were those who said it would have to be preceded by a long process of political integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">This was because sharing a currency would imply a high degree of joint decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">Member countries would be a “Schicksalsgemeinschaft” and would need strong common democratic underpinnings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">But a deliberate choice was made in the 1990s not to give the euro such features.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The euro was launched as a “currency without a state” to preserve the sovereignty and diversity of member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This informed the so-called “Maastricht setup”, which laid the euro’s institutional foundations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.75,0)">But as recent events have shown, this institutional framework left the euro area insufficiently equipped to ensure sound economic policies and effectively manage crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">For this reason, the way ahead cannot be a return to the status quo ante.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.55,0)">The challenges of having a single monetary policy but loosely coordinated fiscal, economic and financial policies have been clearly revealed by the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">As Jean Monnet said, coordination “ is a method which promotes discussion, but it does not lead to a decision.” And strong decisions have to be made to manage the world’s second most important currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">A new architecture for the euro area is desirable to create sustained prosperity for all euro area countries, and especially for Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">The root of Germany’s success is its deep integration into the European and world economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">To continue to prosper, Germany needs to remain an anchor of a strong currency, at the centre of a zone of monetary stability and in a dynamic and competitive euro area economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(186,255,0)">Only a stronger economic and monetary union can provide this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Yet this new architecture does not require a political union first.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">It is clear that monetary union does entail a higher degree of joint decision-making.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">But economic integration and political integration can develop in parallel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">Where necessary, sovereignty in selected economic policy fields can and should be pooled and democratic legitimation deepened.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.93,0)">How far should this go?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">We do not need a centralisation of all economic policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Instead, we can answer this question pragmatically: by calmly asking ourselves which are the minimum requirements to complete economic and monetary union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">And in doing so, we will find that all the necessary measures are firmly within our reach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">For fiscal policies, we need true oversight over national budgets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.86,0)">The consequences of misguided fiscal policies in a monetary union are too severe to remain self-policed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">For broader economic policies, we need to guarantee competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">Countries must be able to generate sustainable growth and high employment without excessive imbalances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">The euro area is not a nation-state where persistent cross-regional subsidies have sufficient popular support.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.48,0)">Therefore, we cannot afford a situation where some regions run permanently large deficits vis-à-vis others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">For financial policies, there need to be powers at the centre to limit excessive risk-taking by banks and regulatory capture by supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This is the best way to protect euro area taxpayers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">There also needs to be a framework for bank resolution that safeguards public finances, as we see in other federations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.11,0)">In the U.S., for example, on average about 90, mostly smaller, banks per year have been resolved since 2008 and this had no impact on the solvency of the sovereign.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Political union can, and shall, develop hand-in-hand with fiscal, economic and financial union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">The sharing of powers and of accountability can move in parallel.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">We should not forget that 60 years of European integration have already created a significant degree of political union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.1,0)">Decisions are made by an EU Council filled by national ministers and by a directly elected European Parliament.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">The challenge is to further increase the legitimacy of these bodies commensurate with increasing their responsibilities and to seek ways to better anchor European processes at the national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">A more solid political foundation should allow for agreement on a basic principle: that it is neither sustainable nor legitimate for countries to pursue national policies that can cause economic harm for others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.21,0)">This constraint has to be built into how countries design their economic and social models.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">The only sustainable model is one that is consistent with the terms of a common currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.73,0)">Countries have to live within their means.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.62,0)">Competition and labour markets have to be reinvigorated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Banks have to conform to the highest regulatory standards and focus on serving the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This is not the end, but the renewal of the European social model.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">From the ECB’s perspective, a strong economic union is an essential complement to the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Building this will require a structured process with correct sequencing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">Yet citizens can be certain that three elements will remain constant.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">The ECB will do what is necessary to ensure price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It will remain independent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">And it will always act within the limits of its mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.12,0)">Yet it should be understood that fulfilling our mandate sometimes requires us to go beyond standard monetary policy tools.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.91,0)">When markets are fragmented or influenced by irrational fears, our monetary policy signals do not reach citizens evenly across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">We have to fix such blockages to ensure a single monetary policy and therefore price stability for all euro area citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.73,0)">This may at times require exceptional measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">But this is our responsibility as the central bank of the euro area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.68,0)">The ECB is not a political institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(211,255,0)">But it is committed to its responsibilities as an institution of the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">As such, we never lose sight of our mission to guarantee a strong and stable currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">The banknotes that we issue bear the European flag and are a powerful symbol of European identity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.77,0)">Those who want to go back to the past misunderstand the significance of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,45.57,0)">Those who claim only a full federation can be sustainable set the bar too high.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">What we need is a gradual and structured effort to complete EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">This would finally give the euro the stable foundations it deserves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(115,255,0)">It would fully achieve the ultimate goals for which the Union and the euro were founded: stability, prosperity and peace.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">We know this is what the people in Europe, and in Germany, aspire to.</span>
