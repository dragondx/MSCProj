    <span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)"> Towards Banking Union Remarks by Peter Praet, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, in the session “  Break It: Today’s Europe at Full Speed” of the LUISS International Conference on “Europe 2017: Make it or Break it”,Rome, 24 January 2017 Today’s conference title ‘Europe 2017: Make it or break it’ brings forth the notion that Europe is at a crossroads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.26,0)">It reflects an increasing polarization between the proponents and the detractors of European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Polarization does not do justice to the policy responses and the institutional reforms that have strengthened our Economic and Monetary Union in the aftermath of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Today I would like to do justice to the significant progress towards Banking Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">In less than half a decade, the European Union moved from decentralized banking supervision and resolution to the Single Supervisory Mechanism and the Single Resolution Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">The fact that more needs to be done to complete the Banking Union should not come as a surprise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.6,0)">The concept of Banking Union is simple ‑ a European bank should be able to operate in the Banking Union exactly as it operates in its domestic market, but its implementation is complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This entails fungibility of capital and liquidity, simplified governance structures, and lower operational costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">The institutional framework should create an environment fostering a more geographically diverse, more resilient banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">There still are a number of legal, institutional, political and even cultural problems to overcome before we can declare this ambitious undertaking achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The direction of progress is clear, its speed less so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Banking Union is not an end in itself, but a backbone of the single currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">First, for money to be truly single within a currency area there has to be full substitutability between its different forms, including full fungibility of deposits across border.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Second, risk sharing channels are particularly important for countries in a monetary union, because the single monetary policy cannot cater to cushion asymmetric shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The financial system is a central channel of adjustment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In a mature monetary union like the United States, empirical evidence suggests that the bulk of shocks to individual states are smoothed through the financial system  and that the contribution of the federal budget to income smoothing is comparatively small.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The financing of the economy has traditionally been market-based in the United States, and bank-based in the European Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">In the light of this, progress towards the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union emerges as a priority for Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The financial crisis taught us that the quality of financial integration matters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.32,0)">Risk sharing through the financial system can go into reverse, and banks can amplify and propagate rather than tame economic disturbances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.35,0)">This is what happened during the crisis, when cross-border capital flows dried up suddenly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.29,0)">The euro area saw itself confronted with financial instability and fragmentation , which severely challenged the single monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Overall, the crisis has led to a profound re-thinking of the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">Sound financial integration relies on a well-designed institutional framework, in particular a regulatory regime reducing the pro-cyclicality of banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">This is essential for them to perform well their role of shock absorber, to support the real economy throughout the business cycle, and ensure financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Several dimensions need to be taken into account in the institutional design of well-functioning risk-sharing arrangements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">First, private versus public risk sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The financial system is a private risk sharing device, but we have learned the lessons from the financial crisis in terms of budgetary costs, when excessive risk-taking in the private sector was eventually borne by the public sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">Not to revert to the old world of implicit government guarantees for risky behaviour of financial institutions entails risk reduction in bank balance sheets through a more resilient loss-absorption capacity throughout the cycle.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,240.42,0)">This makes banks equally liable across countries for the amount of risk they want to take into their respective balance sheet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(93,255,0)">That is not to deny that creating a certain level of public risk sharing is necessary to create confidence in the overall financial system and thereby unlock the potential of private risk-sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.55,0)">Even well-capitalised banks can fall victim to runs and contagion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This is why central banks act as lender of last resort to illiquid, yet solvent banks in times of stress.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Fiscal backstops are equally essential for ensuring trust in the stability of the financial sector, thereby supporting financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,114.05,0)">The existence of fiscal backstops, however, does not mean that taxpayers have to end up paying the bill for individual bank failures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(194,255,0)">In Europe, significant progress to protect taxpayers’ money has been made over the past few years: the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive and the Regulation establishing the Single Resolution Mechanism provide for common rules how to deal with failing banks while minimising the recourse to public funds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The principle of the new European rules is to absorb bank losses by bailing-in shareholders and uninsured creditors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This does not mean that bail-out is fully excluded, as the new rules contain sufficient flexibility to deal with exceptional situations where public money may be required to stabilise the banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">This brings me to the second important dimension of risk-sharing in the Banking Union, which is national versus euro area risk sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.43,0)">The debate on moving forward on EMU is held back by a standoff between the risk reduction and risk sharing camps.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In theory, risk reduction in the banking sector and public risk sharing in a banking union should work in unison.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,174.97,0)">Non-performing loans, however, are one of the major roadblocks on the road towards further public risk-sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">Following up to the 2014 comprehensive assessment, when for the first time the assets of banks were assessed with the same yardstick across the euro area, the Single Supervisory Mechanism is preparing guidance to banks on non-performing loans.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(76,255,0)">This forms a sound basis for the supervisor to evaluate banks’ handling of NPLs and for banks to tackle this problem in a decisive way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">While risk reduction is essential to provide the right incentives to banks and protect taxpayers’ money, a common fiscal backstop remains key to increase the systemic resilience of the euro area banking system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">While supervisory decisions are taken at European level, the relevant risk-sharing mechanisms such as deposit insurance schemes are still at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.48,0)">Supervision is common, but the consequences of potential bank failures are still predominantly national.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.87,0)">National considerations therefore continue to affect supervisory decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">This is not without consequences for the incentives for banks to become more European.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Let me just develop some concrete examples.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">First, the current institutional framework has not yet reached a sufficient degree of harmonization in the underlying rules and standards.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Since the aim is to create a single European banking system, it is essential that credit institutions face a single set of rules and conditions regardless of the location of their activities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.21,0)">This was the intention of the Single Rulebook but it is not yet the reality, also because of national divergences in the transposition of directives or the non-harmonised exercise of so-called Options and National Discretions  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.84,0)">A second example relates to a lack of fungibility of liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.87,0)">Still prevailing liquidity ring-fencing reflects the fact that the interests of a banking group management, which is responsible for the allocation of liquidity within the group, is often not aligned with the public interests of the Member States where the subsidiaries are established .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">A third example is the methodology to identify G-SIBs  , which includes size, interconnectedness, subsituability and infrastructure, complexity and cross-jurisdiction.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(113,255,0)">The euro area is not considered as a single jurisdiction, which may result in applying higher capital buffers to euro area G-SIBs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.88,0)">This environment contributes to the persistence of banking systems overly exposed to their own national economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.46,0)">The institutional underpinnings of the Banking Union do not yet meet the requirements of a genuine single financial market with free financial flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">Nevertheless, significant progress has been achieved over the past years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">The creation of the Single Supervisory Mechanism has been a leap forward in the establishment of a coherent regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">One of the first priorities of the Supervisory Board has been to promote integration through harmonized implementation of ONDs, thereby evening the level playing field in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">It is an ongoing process that started with intensive efforts to identify ONDs in a complex web of legislation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Regarding liquidity requirements, the Single Supervisory Board can grant waivers at national as well as cross-border level on a case-by-case basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.55,0)">Waiving liquidity requirements could increase financial interconnectedness and lead to possible contagion effects in a framework where the consequences of bank failures are still mainly national.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,209.62,0)">At the same time, ring-fencing has a direct impact on cross-border banking and the free flow of funds in the Banking Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">In the current institutional context, where the free flow of liquidity within the same banking group but across border could be impeded, a prudent supervisory approach has led the ECB’s Supervisory Board to still maintain a floor on the liquidity requirements of significant subsidiaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">Whereas the uniform application of prudential law by the Single European Supervisor contributes to financial integration, further progress in the institutional framework is needed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Both supervisory responsibility and the fiscal backstop need to be at European level, to underpin durably confidence in the area-wide financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">A major step in this direction has been the establishment of the Single Resolution Fund in 2016, with national compartments and a mutualised compartment available to fund capital and liquidity needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Currently, the backstop for national compartments consists of national credit lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(134,255,0)">Looking ahead, it will be essential to establish a common fiscal backstop to ensure that the Single Resolution Fund has sufficient resources to support any necessary resolution measures taken by the Single Resolution Board.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,193.56,0)">Just as necessary is the establishment of a European Deposit Insurance System  , with a credible backstop, as the degree of harmonisation recently introduced under the Directive on national deposit schemes still present differences that may affect the choice of group structure between subsidiaries and branches in other countries and limit banks’ appetite for cross-border banking in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.67,0)">Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,158.24,0)">Overall, the banking landscape still resembles too much a collection of banking systems highly exposed to their domestic economies, with limited cross-border private risk-sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">At the same time, unprecedented institutional progress has been achieved in a relatively short time span since the establishment of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">One should recognise that banking union is both an objective and a process of fundamental structural changes in the euro area’s financial architecture.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Today we certainly are more than midway, but this does not imply that one can step back and wait.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The next steps are clearly set out in the ECOFIN roadmap to complete the Banking Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(149,255,0)">It is now urgent to agree on an ambitious timetable for its implementation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">This would foster financial integration in the euro area and contribute to the smooth functioning of our Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">I would like to thank Sander Tordoir and Malte Jahning for their contributions to this speech.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">One estimate suggests that the standard deviation of income growth uncertainty is reduced through financial markets by as much as 35% across U.S. states  , “Risk Sharing Within The United States: What Do Financial Markets And Fiscal Federalism Accomplish?,” The Review of Economics and Statistics, 83 , pp.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.62,0)">688-698.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.88,0)">According to a recent IMF paper, cross-country risk sharing in the euro area is not only more limited  , but also falls sharply in severe downturns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">It also suggests that risk sharing is particularly fostered through various forms of equity holdings, underlining the importance of the capital markets union and its emphasis on equity markets.</span>
