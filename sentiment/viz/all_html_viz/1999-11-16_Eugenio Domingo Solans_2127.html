    <span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)"> The euro as a new international currency Speech delivered by Eugenio Domingo Solans, Member of the Governing Council and the Executive Board of the European Central Bank, at the luncheon conference organised by the World Affairs Council and The European Institute at the Rittenhouse Hotel Philadelphia, 16 November 1999 Let me begin by thanking Mr. Churchill of the World Affairs Council of Philadelphia and Madame Grapin, President of The European Institute, for inviting me to this luncheon and for giving me the opportunity to give you my views and, therefore, the views of the European System of Central Banks  , on the euro as an international currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">Nowadays the euro is the second most widely used currency in the world economy, behind the US dollar and ahead of the Japanese yen.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.9,0)">As we all know, any currency fulfils three basic functions: it is a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">As a store of value the use of the euro as an investment and financing currency is rapidly increasing, as investors understand the advisability of diversifying their portfolio currencies among those which are more stable and more internationally used.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.56,0)">The euro is developing at a slower pace as a medium of exchange or payment currency in the international exchange of goods and services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">This fact can easily be explained by the combined and reinforcing effects of network externalities and economies of scale in the use of a predominant international currency as a medium of exchange, as is the case with the US dollar.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The use of the euro as a unit of account is linked to its use as a store of value and a medium of exchange.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.07,0)">The value stored in euro or the payments made in euro will tend to be counted in euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">There are good reasons to expect an increase in international public use of the euro as a reserve, intervention and pegging currency, inasmuch as the public authorities understand that it is worthwhile to allocate their foreign reserves among the main international currencies and to give the euro a relevant share in accordance with its internal and external stability and the economic and financial importance of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.24,0)">In connection with the use of the euro as a pegging currency, approximately 30 countries outside the euro area currently have exchange rate regimes involving the euro to a greater or lesser extent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">These exchange rate regimes are currency boards  ; currencies pegged to the euro  ; currencies pegged to a basket of currencies including the euro, in some cases with a fluctuation band  ; systems of managed floating in which the euro is used informally as the reference currency  ; and, last but not least, European Union currencies pegged to the euro through a co-operative arrangement, namely ERM II.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Denmark and Greece joined ERM II on 1 January 1999 with a ±2.25% fluctuation band for the Danish krone and a ±15% fluctuation band for the Greek drachma.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(83,255,0)">Although the euro remains in second position after the US dollar in terms of its official use, the role of the euro will increase in the future, without a doubt, especially after the year 2002 when the euro banknotes and coins will begin to circulate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.54,0)">Taking the current situation as a starting point, the Eurosystem's position concerning the future international role of the euro is crystal clear: we shall not adopt a belligerent stance in order to force the use of the euro upon the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">We are convinced that the use of the euro as an international currency will come about anyway.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.59,0)">It will happen spontaneously, slowly but inexorably, without any impulses other than those based on free will and the decisions of market participants, without any logic other than that of the market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.23,0)">In other words, the internationalisation of the euro is not a policy objective of the Eurosystem; it will neither be fostered nor hindered by us.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">The development of the euro as an international currency will be a market-driven process, a free process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">The euro fulfils the necessary conditions to be a leading international currency with the US dollar and not against it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">There is enough room for both currencies in the world economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The necessary conditions for a currency to become an international currency are based on two broad factors: low risk and large size.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The low risk factor is related to the confidence inspired by the currency and its central bank, which in turn mainly depends on the internal and external stability of the currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(190,255,0)">The low risk factor tends to lead to diversification among international currencies, since diversification is a means to reduce the overall risk; it acts, so to speak, as a centrifugal force.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">By contrast, the large size factor relates to the relative demographic economic and financial importance of the area which supports the currency; in other words, the "habitat" of the currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">The large size factor, which concerns the demographic, economic and financial dimension, generally tends to lead to centralisation around one or a few key international currencies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(116,255,0)">It can be seen as a centripetal force, as a virtuous circle, which will tend to lead to an increasing use of the euro as an international currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let us consider these two factors in more detail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The first factor concerns low risk, credibility and stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The stability of the euro is a priority for the ECB.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">The basic factor that will determine the importance of the euro as a widely used currency in the world economy, in addition to the demographic, economic and financial dimensions of the euro area, is, without a doubt, the stability of the new currency, understood as a means to maintain the purchasing power of savings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">Stability is the basic requirement for a good currency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It is what we at the ECB want for the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">We want a stable euro and we are convinced that, in the long term, the euro will derive strength from its stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Does anybody know a stable currency which is not a strong currency in the medium term?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The stability of the euro is the basis for the confidence in and the credibility of the ECB, without which a large international role for the euro would be unthinkable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Stability is the proof of the effectiveness of the institution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Yet in order to be credible it is not sufficient for the ECB to maintain stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">Other parameters of its action must be considered: accountability, transparency and communication, a Europe-wide perspective, etc.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.33,0)">These parameters or conditions for the credibility of the euro are certainly demanding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">However, the achievement of these conditions is the aim of all those of us who have responsibilities with regard to the functioning of the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">The second factor, which we have called the large size factor or the habitat of the euro, is important because without a certain critical mass, a currency cannot have international relevance, however high its degree of stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.13,0)">The figures relating to the population and the GDP of the euro area illustrate this.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">With 292 million inhabitants, its population exceeds that of the United States   and that of Japan  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">The GDP of the euro area is, on the other hand, equal to 76% of the GDP of the United States  , though it is higher than that of Japan  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.97,0)">The source of this information, which refers to 1998, is Eurostat.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">However, even more important than the current figures is the potential for the future development of the euro area, in terms of population and GDP, if and when the so-called "pre-ins"   join the Eurosystem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">The entry of these countries would result in a monetary area of 376 million inhabitants, 39% larger than the United States and almost triple the size of Japan, with a GDP of EUR 7,495 billion, only slightly less than that of the United States and 125% higher than that of Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">All these facts and figures which demonstrate the demographic and economic importance of the European Union would be further strengthened by enlargement to eastern Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Our continent has a historical, cultural and geographical identity - from the Iberian peninsula to the Urals, with certain additional external territories - which, in the future, may also come to form an economic unit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">However that is, for the moment, a distant prospect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,255,0)">The size or habitat of an economy does not only depend on demographic or economic factors; it also has to do with the financial base or dimension of the area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.45,0)">In considering the financial dimension of the euro area, the first relevant feature to observe is the low level of capitalisation of the stock markets in comparison with the United States and Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Although this feature could give the impression that the euro area has a relatively small financial dimension relative to its economic dimension, this is not the case.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(131,255,0)">The lower degree of development of the capital markets is offset by a higher degree of banking assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This means that the financial base of real economic activity in Europe is founded on bank intermediation, which is also a feature of the Japanese economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.79,0)">For example, private domestic credit in the euro area amounts to 92.4% of GDP, while in the United States it is only 68.9%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.92,0)">Conversely, fixed domestic income represents 34.2% of GDP in the euro area compared with 66.1% of GDP in the United States  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">We, therefore, have two distinct models of private financing which clearly have to be taken into account when assessing Europe's financial dimension compared with the United States or Japan.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The euro, the Eurosystem's monetary policy and, in general, the activity of the ECB and the Eurosystem play a key role in the integration of European financial markets and all markets in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">The euro is acting as a catalyst for European economic integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">And more integration will lead to a greater economic and financial dimension.</span>
