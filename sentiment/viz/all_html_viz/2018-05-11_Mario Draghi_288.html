    <h1> Risk-reducing and risk-sharing in our Monetary Union </h1>
    <h2> Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the European University Institute, Florence, 11 May 2018 </h2>
    <h3> Speaker: Mario Draghi </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)"> Risk-reducing and risk-sharing in our Monetary Union Speech by Mario Draghi, President of the ECB, at the European University Institute, Florence, 11 May 2018 It is a great pleasure for me to be invited by the European University Institute, which in many ways mirrors what the European project is for.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">It was founded to encourage exchange, cooperation and a common European vision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(201,255,0)">Since then, the university has made countless contributions in the fields of economics, law, political science and history.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">It has often been the meeting point where academic research helps answer the urgent policy questions of the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">A decade after the great financial crisis, the euro area looks set to exit more resilient than it entered it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">Much of the harm caused by the economic downturn has now been reversed by a consistent period of growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">And some of the institutional and structural factors that exacerbated the crisis have been addressed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,160.44,0)">But we know that our Monetary Union is not complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.61,0)">The crisis revealed some specific fragilities in the euro area’s construction that so far have not been resolved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">To make our Monetary Union more robust against future challenges, we need to address these fragilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.8,0)">The history of the crisis in the euro area The crisis took place in five main phases.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The first phase was similar across advanced economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.34,0)">Most had a financial sector characterised by poor risk management, low capital and liquidity, inadequate corporate governance, and weak supervision and regulation – diluted by many years of excessive optimism in the self-repairing power of markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.84,0)">When the Lehman shock hit, banks exposed to toxic US assets ran into difficulties and some were bailed out by their governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.4,0)">In the euro area, these banks were mostly located in Germany, France and the Netherlands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.65,0)">Bank bailouts took place on a staggering scale.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">In 2009, they totalled around 8% of GDP in Germany, 5% in France and 12% in the Netherlands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">These bailouts did not greatly affect sovereign borrowing costs, however, thanks largely to the relatively strong fiscal positions of the governments implementing them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.86,0)">In the second phase, the crisis spread to banks in Spain and Ireland that had similar weaknesses, but were instead overexposed to the collapsing domestic real estate market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.08,0)">Another wave of bank bailouts followed, and some signs of tensions in sovereign debt markets began to appear.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,76.9,0)">Those tensions were compounded by the third phase, which began when the Greek crisis shattered the impression that public debt was risk-free, triggering a rapid repricing of sovereign risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">To those who saw the crisis as a consequence of moral hazard, this represented a required return of market discipline vis-à-vis sovereigns – a view that was reflected in the Deauville agreement in October 2010.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.87,0)">These events spread contagion to all sovereigns now perceived as vulnerable by financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.68,0)">But they affected most of all those with high public debt levels, a lack of fiscal space, fragile market access and, especially, low growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Sovereign risk was then transmitted into the domestic banking sector through two channels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">The first was through banks’ direct exposures to their own governments’ bonds.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.01,0)">Between January 2010 and July 2012, banks in Greece, Italy and Portugal incurred aggregate losses on sovereign bonds of vulnerable countries  amounting respectively to 161%, 22% and 36% of their Core Tier 1 capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,27.94,0)">Regardless of whether these losses directly affected regulatory capital , they had an adverse effect on perceptions of solvency in those national banking systems.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.5,0)">The second channel was via negative confidence effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.26,0)">Because the public sector makes up roughly half the economy in many euro area countries, and because of credit rating dynamics, the fear of possible sovereign defaults had a dramatic effect on confidence in the domestic private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,227.14,0)">Any distinction between firms and banks, and between banks with and without high sovereign exposures, disappeared.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.98,0)">The general loss of confidence in these countries’ prospects reverberated through the banking sector via a further fall in growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,133.94,0)">In this way, the crisis spread to banks that did not have significant exposures either to US sub-prime assets or to domestic real estate, and therefore had not until then needed to be bailed out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.91,0)">However, governments in these countries found themselves unable to substantially respond to the emerging crisis with public money for the banking sector and countercyclical fiscal policy, due to lack of fiscal space and high debt.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.89,0)">Financial markets then began to fragment along national lines and cross-border funding dried up, exacerbated by defensive risk management by banks and ring-fencing of liquidity by supervisors in the core countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.69,0)">Lack of liquidity, coupled with capital depletion from domestic losses, precipitated a renewed credit crunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.51,0)">Countries were trapped in a “bad equilibrium” caused by the three-way link between sovereigns, banks and domestic firms and households.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.79,0)">Falling credit aggravated the ongoing recession, increased loan losses and further weakened bank balance sheets, which in turn pushed sovereign borrowing costs higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.37,0)">Fiscal policy, under the pressure of losing market access altogether, took mainly the more expedient route of higher taxes, which led instead to lower growth and therefore renewed market jitters, somewhat defeating its original purpose.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,165.1,0)">The fourth stage of the crisis was triggered by investors in both Europe and the rest of the world.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,51.55,0)">Faced with a downward growth spiral, many investors reached the conclusion that the only way out for crisis-hit countries, given the institutional design of the euro area, was for them to exit from it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">This would, it was believed, allow them to depreciate their currencies and regain monetary sovereignty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.76,0)">Fearing redenomination into lower-value currencies, investors sold off domestic public and private debt, further widening spreads and exacerbating bad equilibria within vulnerable economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">In 2012, spreads vis-à-vis German ten-year government bonds reached 500 basis points in Italy and 600 basis points in Spain, with even wider spreads in Greece, Portugal and Ireland.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.17,0)">The fifth stage of the crisis then followed: the breakdown in monetary policy transmission across the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.85,0)">Interest rates faced by firms and households in vulnerable countries became increasingly divorced from short-term central bank rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.88,0)">As those economies represented a third of euro area GDP, this posed a profound threat to price stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(51,255,0)">The ECB responded with its announcement of Outright Monetary Transactions  , which restored confidence in sovereign bond markets, helped to repair the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and broke the downward spiral.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">With less of a direct market impact, but fundamental in confirming to the world the strength of our leaders’ commitment to the euro, was the earlier decision to create the banking union and the European Stability Mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">The long trip back to growth had begun.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">The unfolding of the euro area crisis yielded lessons for the financial sector, for individual countries and for the union as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,204.95,0)">But the unifying theme was the inability of each of these actors to effectively absorb shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,172.74,0)">In some cases, because of their weaknesses, they even amplified those shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.15,0)">Indeed, banks fuelled the build-up of imbalances and then exacerbated the resulting crash.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.33,0)">Countries had too low growth potential, limited flexibility to bounce back from the crisis and too little fiscal space to stabilise their economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And the euro area as a whole was shown to have no public and very little private risk-sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,218.42,0)">Risk-sharing within monetary unions In the classical optimum currency area   literature, what makes membership of a monetary union work for all its members is a trade-off: what they lose in terms of national stabilisation tools is counterbalanced by new adjustment mechanisms within the currency area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">These mechanisms are typically held to be labour and capital mobility, as well as fiscal transfers between different parts of the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,208.12,0)">In other words, they are ex post and take place after a recession has set in.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In the United States, which is a relatively well-functioning monetary union, ex post adjustment plays an important role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">Fiscal transfers through the US federal budget are estimated to absorb around 10% of shocks , while about half of the long-run response to a rise in unemployment takes place through labour mobility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">But the outcomes achieved in the US are not substantially different to those in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">Though the euro area does not have a large central budget, national fiscal policies can still provide significant stabilisation, so long as countries can use fiscal policy freely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,112.39,0)">It is estimated that 49% of an unemployment shock is absorbed by the automatic stabilisers in the euro area, whereas the figure for the US is 32%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(42,255,0)">And studies have found a gradual convergence in labour mobility between Europe and the US, reflecting both a fall in interstate migration in the US and a rise in the role of migration in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Where the euro area and the US differ more is in terms of ex ante risk-sharing – that is, insuring against shocks through financial markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This was a concept that only appeared later in the literature on Optimal Currency Areas.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">But it plays a key role in stabilising local economies in a monetary union, in two ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The first is by de-linking consumption and income at the local level, which happens through integrated capital markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">If labour income falls during a recession, but the private sector holds a diversified financial portfolio, people can smooth their consumption with the financial returns they receive on assets in better performing parts of the union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">The second way is by de-linking the capital of local banks from the volume of local credit supply, which happens through retail banking integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.15,0)">Because local banks are typically heavily exposed to the local economy, a downturn in their home region will lead to large losses and prompt them to cut lending to all sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">But if there are cross-border banks that operate in all parts of the union, they can offset any losses made in the recession-hit region with gains in another, and can continue to provide credit to sound borrowers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">In the US, both credit and capital market integration have played an increasingly important role in smoothing local shocks over the past decades.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.25,0)">For example, following the oil price collapse in the mid-1980s, almost every bank in Texas failed, creating a state-wide credit crunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,130.54,0)">One reason for this was that out-of-state banks were banned from the Texas market, so the balance sheets of local banks were completely concentrated on their home state.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">But since then there has been major integration in the retail banking sector, with the number of multi-state banks increasing from around 100 in the early 1990s to more than 700 today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.58,0)">This has significantly weakened the relationship between local capital and local credit supply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">And as a result, the volatility of business cycle shocks among US states has become smaller.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.79,0)">Overall, it is estimated that around 70% of local shocks are smoothed through financial markets in the US, with capital markets absorbing around 45% and credit markets 25%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.72,0)">In the euro area, by contrast, the total figure is just 25%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.29,0)">Private risk-sharing of course has its limits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,231.04,0)">Faced with large common shocks that affect the whole monetary union, the benefits of diversification can break down, as happened to some extent in the US during the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.29,0)">One study finds that capital market risk-sharing in the US dropped by almost half in the crisis period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">But this does not alter the conclusion that deepening private risk-sharing in the euro area would be beneficial for macroeconomic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">So how can we achieve it?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.11,0)">The experience of other monetary unions, and our own up to now, suggests that it does not happen by itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">Rather, private risk-sharing has to be enabled by public sector policies at both the national and union levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">In this sense, private risk-sharing cannot be seen as a substitute for the further development of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">It is a complement to it and follows from it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.98,0)">The policies we need fall into two main categories.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(110,255,0)">Creating a more stable financial sector First of all, we need policies that make the financial system more stable, both by increasing the resilience of banks and by completing the banking union and the capital markets union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The euro area has already made good progress on these fronts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The post-crisis regulatory reforms have significantly strengthened the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">The Common Equity Tier 1 ratios of significant banks have risen from 8.7% in 2008 to 14.5% today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In the same period leverage ratios have risen from 3.7% to 5.8%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">And banks have much more stable liquidity and funding.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">The creation of European banking supervision has also brought about a more uniform approach to how banks are supervised.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(147,255,0)">And the new EU resolution framework has shifted the cost of bank failures away from sovereigns and onto the financial sector, which creates another channel of private risk-sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.24,0)">Without entering into the discussion on which further regulations may be necessary for the shadow banking sector, we have to acknowledge that the banking union and the capital markets union are not yet complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">We lack a truly level playing field for cross-border banks and investors, and this stands in the way of deep financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">A single financial market should have one set of rules and all market participants should be able to operate freely within it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,153.02,0)">Yet that is not the case at present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.49,0)">For capital markets, there are differing rules and market practices for financial products across countries, and insolvency and judicial systems vary widely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">This matters because a consistent and efficient framework for pursuing failed contracts is vital to reduce uncertainty for cross-border investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(77,255,0)">ECB analysis finds that where insolvency and judicial frameworks are more efficient, risk-sharing through both capital and credit markets is higher.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.4,0)">For banks, the Single Market is still fragmented along national lines.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,37.32,0)">First, discrepancies in the regulatory framework reduce the economies of scale for banks operating across borders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.67,0)">Second, an incomplete framework for bank resolution also deters cross-border integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.66,0)">When resolution is not fully credible, it can create incentives for national authorities to limit capital and liquidity flows so as to advantage their depositors in the event of a bank failing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,214.71,0)">But when the new EU resolution framework is completed and working properly, such concerns about depositors should be allayed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.78,0)">The Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive already places depositors at the top of the creditor hierarchy in resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(75,255,0)">And the new minimum requirements for own funds and eligible liabilities should ensure that there is a sufficient buffer of loss-absorbing capacity to make depositor bail-in extremely unlikely.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,164.75,0)">What is still missing, however, is a backstop for the Single Resolution Fund.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">Resolution needs financing , and the Resolution Fund, which is funded by banks, will ensure that it is paid for by the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.33,0)">But in a very deep crisis, the resources of such funds can be depleted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,82.87,0)">That is why in all the other large jurisdictions, such as the US, the UK and Japan, resolution funds are backstopped by the fiscal authority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">The aim of such backstops is not to bail banks out: any funds borrowed are repaid by the private sector over time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(78,255,0)">Rather, the aim is to create confidence that bank resolution can always be enacted efficiently, which has a stabilising effect in a crisis and prevents more banks from being dragged into difficulties.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">In other words, policies that reduce risks for the banking system as a whole will also lead to larger risk-reduction for individual banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.62,0)">A good example of this is the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation   in the US, which is also the resolution authority, and is backstopped by a credit line with the US Treasury.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">During the crisis, around 500 banks were resolved in the US without triggering financial instability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.95,0)">In contrast, one estimate puts the total number of banks resolved in the euro area in that period at around 50.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">An orderly resolution of this magnitude was possible in the US because of confidence in a well-functioning resolution framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(151,255,0)">And the presence of the Treasury backstop was fundamental in creating this confidence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">Indeed, the FDIC ultimately did not have to draw on its credit line, but it was clearly reassuring to markets and to depositors that it had that option as a last resort.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.22,0)">In fact, the FDIC has only borrowed from the Treasury once, during the savings and loans crisis in the early 1990s, and it repaid in full a few years later.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,136.77,0)">This example underlines that the dichotomy between risk-reduction and risk-sharing that characterises the debate today is, in many ways, artificial.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(157,255,0)">With the right policy framework, these two goals are mutually reinforcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">Public risk-sharing through backstops helps reduce risks across the system by containing market panics when a crisis hits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">And a strong resolution framework ensures that, when bank failures do happen, very little public risk-sharing is actually needed as the costs are fully borne by the private sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">So we need to put first things first and complete the resolution framework in all its dimensions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">And creating a properly designed European deposit insurance scheme would be an additional element that could further reduce the risk of bank runs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">All in all, a consistent framework of regulations, laws, judicial enforcement and resolution is essential for deep and resilient financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Completing the banking union and the capital markets union is therefore a necessary condition for the expansion of private risk-sharing in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,149.1,0)">Yet it is not a sufficient condition.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(105,255,0)">And this brings me to the second area where public sector policies can complement private risk-sharing: by increasing economic convergence and thereby building trust among cross-border investors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,40.27,0)">Increasing economic convergence The crisis showed clearly the potential of some euro area economies to become trapped in bad equilibria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">And plainly, as long as this risk exists, it will act as a deterrent to cross-border integration, especially for retail banks that cannot “cut and run” as soon as a recession hits.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,233.71,0)">Put simply, we will not be able to foster private risk-sharing in our union if crises can call its very integrity into question.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">So, if we are to deepen private risk-sharing, the tail risk of bad equilibria needs to be removed, and replaced by policies that lead to sustainable convergence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This requires action at both the national and euro area levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.4,0)">In the eyes of many observers, three features made countries vulnerable to downward spirals: weak banks, lack of fiscal space and low growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Stabilising the financial sector in the ways I have just described would address one part of the problem.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">But the common factor uniting all three was growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.27,0)">Very low growth rates reduced fiscal space and harmed bank balance sheets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">At the national level, structural reforms therefore remain a priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">We know that structural reforms boost growth: looking at the last 15 to 20 years, euro area countries with sound economic structures at the outset have shown much higher long-term real growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">And we know that they help countries recover more quickly from shocks, which prevents recessions from leaving lasting scars.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.67,0)">That said, while sound domestic policies are key to protect countries from market pressure, the crisis showed that, in certain conditions, they may not be enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,48.76,0)">Markets tend to be procyclical and can penalise sovereigns that are perceived to be vulnerable, over and above what may be needed to restore a sustainable fiscal path.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.04,0)">And this overshooting can harm growth and ultimately worsen fiscal sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(98,255,0)">This creates a need for some form of common stabilisation function to prevent countries from diverging too much during crises, as has already been acknowledged with the creation of two European facilities to tackle bad equilibria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">One is the ECB’s OMTs, which can be used when there is a threat to euro area price stability and comes with an ESM programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.56,0)">The other is the ESM itself.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.68,0)">But the conditionality attached to its programmes in general also implies procyclical fiscal tightening.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">So, we need an additional fiscal instrument to maintain convergence during large shocks, without having to over-burden monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">Its aim would be to provide an extra layer of stabilisation, thereby reinforcing confidence in national policies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.67,0)">It is not conceptually simple to design such an instrument as it should not, among many other complexities, compensate for weaknesses that can and should be addressed by policies and reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">It is not legally simple because such an instrument should be consistent with the Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And, as we have seen from our longstanding discussions, it is certainly not politically simple, regardless of the shape that such an instrument could take: from the provision of supranational public goods – like security, defence or migration – to a fully-fledged fiscal capacity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(66,255,0)">But the argument whereby risk-sharing may help to greatly reduce risk, or
