    <span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)"> Monetary Union, Regulation and Supervision Speech by Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB,introductory keynote address at the 9th Annual European Financial ServicesConference “Taking Stock of Reform: Fragmentation or Convergence?”, Brussels,10 February 2011, Introduction   The title of this session is ‘Assessing the EU’s re-regulation effort’.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">To be clear from the outset, we are striving not simply for re-regulation, but for better regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">What constitutes ‘ better’?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">In my remarks this morning, I will offer a central banker’s view of where we should be heading in this domain – and of what work still needs to be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.85,0)">As recent events have shown, the financial crisis has complicated the implementation of monetary policy, in particular by creating instability in the transmission mechanism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.6,0)">And, within a monetary union, differences between member countries – either created by the financial turmoil or exacerbated by it – have added to the uncertainty and complexity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">During the crisis, the ECB has implemented a set of non-standard measures to address such concerns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">We consider that these measures have been successful in ensuring that monetary policy remains effective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Another important factor throughout the crisis has been the firm anchoring of inflation expectations, which strengthened our stance against deflationary pressures in the worst part of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Such an anchoring is the result of all the decisions, each one of them, taken during the first decade of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">Overall, we believe that our ability to maintain price stability remains unimpaired.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,202.98,0)">The post-crisis world will face two potentially conflicting challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">The first one is to achieve stronger financial integration as a factor of growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In other words, we need more ‘E’ in EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">Deepening financial integration is a key aspect of the economic part of EMU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">Deeper cross-border banking activities, especially at the retail level, are one way of achieving this objective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(59,255,0)">Enhancing and harmonising the regulatory and supervisory framework across Europe is a crucial step towards this goal.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(119,255,0)">However, greater integration may imply greater risk of contagion, as financial systems, markets and institutions become more intimately entwined.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Better regulation means achieving both a more integrated European financial sector, with deeper markets and more diversified institutions as well as a more robust financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Attaining this twofold objective would allow the benefits of integration to be reaped, while managing the associated spillover risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.49,0)">More ‘E’ in EMU The financial and economic crisis over the last three years has exposed the main supervisory and regulatory failures both at national and global levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">In Europe, it has also revealed how financial integration has increased the likelihood, scope and pace of contagion across the European financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.06,0)">The institutional framework for managing the euro area economy and financial system has proved to be inadequate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">To be more specific, the monetary part of EMU has worked well.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Price stability – the primary objective of the single monetary policy – has been maintained, before, during and after the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.68,0)">But the economic dimension has been insufficient.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(85,255,0)">As I just said, we need more ‘E’ in EMU, with a view to creating an economic area that is more closely, deeply and irreversibly integrated.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,186.84,0)">The origins of the recent economic crisis lay largely in the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">A more resilient financial sector is key to building a euro area framework that will be more robust and effective in facing future shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Deepening and broadening financial integration in Europe is an essential – although neglected – component of the economic dimension of Economic and Monetary Union.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Stronger integration will not only ensure a more efficient allocation of resources across the EU, but also enhance the shock-absorbing capacity of the financial system and the economy as a whole, thanks to increased opportunities for risk-sharing, and improved market and funding liquidity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)">Research using data from the United States has demonstrated the important role played by financial markets and capital flows in absorbing the impact of idiosyncratic regional shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">The risk-sharing across regions resulting from an integrated financial system in the US has a far greater smoothing effect on regional consumption patterns than that achieved via explicit fiscal transfers through the federal government’s budget.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">This shows that it is an integrated financial sector, rather than the federal budget, which plays the most important role in ensuring that regional disturbances do not disrupt the functioning of the American economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Research undertaken by ECB staff confirms that greater banking integration within the EU has increased consumption risk-sharing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">But there is clearly some way to go before the level of integration – and thus the extent of risk-sharing – seen in the United States is achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">These results have important implications for the current debate on further European integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">There is a lot of talk about the need to move towards a more integrated fiscal union and debt financing in the euro area, as a means to enhance stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">A more integrated financial market is likely to be a more efficient way to enhance euro area resilience.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Financial integration did advance rapidly after the introduction of the euro, particularly in wholesale markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,212.47,0)">But in certain segments, markets have remained fragmented along national lines – not least retail banking.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,67.4,0)">This is a politically sensitive sector, due to concerns about consumer protection and the financing of small businesses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.2,0)">But when retail banking markets are fragmented, governments are more likely to resort to ‘national solutions’ in the face of a financial crisis – possibly in an uncoordinated fashion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.69,0)">Experience shows a piecemeal approach can be very disruptive to financial stability and monetary transmission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,54.0,0)">For example, we have seen the externalities created by the Irish government’s decision to guarantee all Irish bank liabilities in the immediate aftermath of Lehman’s failure in 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,58.23,0)">We are still dealing with the consequences of those decisions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">To ensure that the benefits of greater financial integration more than outweigh the risks – including that of a more concentrated banking system – the EU regulatory and supervisory framework needs to be enhanced and harmonised, taking the necessary area-wide perspective and thereby recognising and internalising the cross-border externalities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,102.72,0)">One objection to a more integrated banking system in Europe is the role of national budgets in crisis resolution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.63,0)">As long as budgets remain national – so goes the argument – crisis resolution has to remain national, and so does supervision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.3,0)">The crisis has shown that bank resolution and restructuring are more complicated for cross-border institutions, given that any fiscal costs have to be distributed across several host sovereigns.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.54,0)">As Charles Goodhart has said, “…cross-border banks are international in life, but national in death”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">As I see it, enhanced financial integration in the euro area does not necessarily imply a need for greater fiscal union – if that is understood as a pooling of tax revenues, harmonisation of tax rates or issuance of a common bond.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">Instead, we must develop the capacity at the area-wide level to address specific financial tensions that threaten to spill over to the area as a whole, minimising disruptions to market integration and supporting the transmission of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The recent crisis – and, in particular, developments in Ireland – have demonstrated that, despite the imperfect integration of the European financial system, very strong cross-border contagion takes place within the financial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.37,0)">The instruments available at present to block this contagion are not efficient and have side-effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,29.98,0)">In practice, much of the burden to contain contagion has fallen on central banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.43,0)">This is neither desirable nor appropriate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">In my view, the European authorities need to develop a capacity to conduct a ‘surgical strike’ on problematic financial institutions or market segments in the event of a financial crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Through such actions, the area-wide externalities created by specific problems can be contained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">In practice, this means ensuring that programmes such as the European Financial Stability Facility   or the European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism   – and their envisaged permanent successors – are given sufficient financial resources and the required flexibility by the Member States to act as necessary to support financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">To do so, these bodies may also need to be able to support the recapitalisation of an ailing banking system, if its weakness threatens the stability of the area as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">All this of course comes with strict conditionality in the context of an overall EU/IMF programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">This has been the case in both the Greek and Irish programmes, in which funds are dedicated to the recapitalisation of the weak banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">A more systematic approach should be pursued, making it easier for countries to implement such a scheme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">Developing an enhanced and harmonised regulatory and supervisory framework The ECB has a keen interest in ensuring that the regulatory and supervisory structure, at both national and EU level, provides all players with incentives to avoid excessive risk-taking that could lead to destabilising the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">In addition, consistent rules and convergent supervisory practices are essential to the creation of a level playing field and avoidance of competitive distortions, which would otherwise hinder financial integration within the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(165,255,0)">The financial crisis has prompted a significant development of the regulatory and supervisory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Under the auspices of the G20, a remarkable amount of work has been done to mend the regulatory shortcomings revealed by the crisis at global and European level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">A key element in strengthening the resilience of the financial system has been the adoption of the new Basel III framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(36,255,0)">Concrete efforts have also been made to reinforce the supervisory framework, with greater emphasis placed on monitoring and assessing macro-prudential risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">The powers and tools of micro-prudential supervisors have also been enhanced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Other important regulatory initiatives, notably work on systemically important financial institutions, shadow banking, crisis management and resolution frameworks, are under way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">In Europe many initiatives have been or are being taken to strengthen the regulatory and supervisory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive   have been made to correct the adverse incentives relating to securitisation and remuneration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">A further review of the CRD is under way, aligning the European regulatory framework with the Basel III framework, which is expected to improve the resilience and stability of the banking system by enhancing the quality and quantity of capital and introducing leverage and liquidity requirements.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(55,255,0)">Other important initiatives have also been taken or are under way to improve and extend the scope of regulation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">Examples include the regulation of hedge funds through the adoption of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and credit rating agencies, and the upcoming review of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">In addition to the ongoing initiatives to reinforce the regulatory framework, the supervisory framework in Europe has also been enhanced through the establishment of the European Systemic Risk Board   and the three European Supervisory Authorities  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(162,255,0)">These authorities should help to strengthen the oversight of risks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(189,255,0)">The risk warnings and recommendations to be issued by the ESRB should become a powerful tool to identify significant risks in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">And the powers of the three ESAs – notably their mediation and coordination powers, their envisaged role in emergency situations and, in particular, their mandate to create an EU rule book through the issuance of binding technical standards – should further harmonise the regulatory and supervisory framework within the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(170,255,0)">Even though the framework has been substantially enhanced, challenges remain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">Whether the framework will reach its full potential depends on many factors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(188,255,0)">First, it is important that the new authorities are empowered to act decisively and swiftly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(222,255,0)">Rapid decision-making as well as the independence of regulatory authorities is essential to safeguard financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In this context let me mention that in the US the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have been granted more regulatory powers than their counterparts in the EU, although the effectiveness of those powers will ultimately depend on the way they are applied.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(183,255,0)">Second, it is important that within our relatively complex institutional framework, the ESRB, the three European Supervisory Authorities and the national authorities collaborate effectively.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Information-sharing is key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,159.03,0)">It has been insufficient in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Will it change in the future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.2,0)">Third, the creation of an EU rule book is, of itself, not enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">Only when its implementation is harmonised can such a rule book facilitate cross-border activities, and thus contribute to a more integrated financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The ESAs have an important role here to ensure that the rule book is implemented in a consistent way also through their coordination of the activity in colleges of supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(213,255,0)">In addition, the ESAs, crucially, have to ensure that the EU-wide stress tests are conducted in a uniform way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">We have seen from experience that the credibility of the results of the EU-wide stress tests depends on whether they are conducted with sufficient rigour in all the countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.2,0)">Lack of rigour in one country can undermine the credibility of all.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">All these elements of the new European supervisory framework are expected to address the challenges related to an integrated area such as the EU.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.94,0)">However, in the euro area the very existence of the single currency amplifies the interconnectedness between countries and financial systems and thus the potential for contagion in stress situations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(111,255,0)">The new EU supervisory framework must therefore be capable of addressing this specificity of the euro area through tailored coordinated actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Financial stability and monetary policy Within this changing institutional landscape, close collaboration is required between central bankers, regulators and supervisors, given the intimate connection between monetary policy and financial stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(202,255,0)">The European arrangements, with the close links they have established between the ECB and the ESRB, recognise this need, while retaining distinct mandates and maintaining a clear division of responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">Recent events have amply demonstrated how financial crises influence macroeconomic prospects, the outlook for price stability and thus the appropriate setting of the monetary policy stance.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">At the same time, we have seen how monetary policy measures – of both standard and non-standard varieties – can support the functioning and stability of financial institutions and markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">After all, central banks are the ultimate providers of liquidity, and thus have a pivotal role to play in any financial turmoil or panic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.52,0)">The interactions between monetary policy and financial stability are complex.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">They need to be managed carefully, avoiding any confusion of mandates and responsibilities.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In particular, we need to avoid moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">Liquidity support provided to banks that face funding difficulties cannot delay the necessary fundamental restructuring of such institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">Recent experience confirms my view that central banks must be closely involved in addressing financial tensions, cooperating closely with supervisory bodies in supporting financial stability, even while recognising the primacy of their own price stability mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(87,255,0)">Concluding remarks To sum up, deeper financial integration within Europe is critical in making the economic dimension of Economic and Monetary Union function better.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">It will not only offer direct gains in terms of allocative efficiency, but also make monetary policy transmission more effective and robust, thereby supporting the achievement of our primary objective of price stability, as well as wider macroeconomic stability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(121,255,0)">Greater cross-border banking activity, especially at the retail level, has an important role to play in this regard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">These conclusions are consistent with the main message of the Lamfalussy report, published as far back as 2001.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">This report argued that progress with financial integration in the EU should be regularly reassessed and, if necessary, initiatives taken to further deepen and accelerate the integration process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.55,0)">The recent crisis has demonstrated that the European financial system was insufficiently robust.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">Further measures to deepen integration and bolster stability are required.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Looking forward, we have to identify any remaining weaknesses and seek to address them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.78,0)">Until now, it has generally been argued that the main responsibility for financial supervision has to remain at national level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.76,0)">The consequences of failures in supervision ultimately fall on the taxpayers of the country where the bank resides.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">To align incentives and ensure appropriate accountability, nationally defined tax bases imply nationally defined supervisory institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,213.17,0)">However, the crisis has demonstrated that the implications of supervisory failures extend well beyond national boundaries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,94.7,0)">First, cross-border contagion has been magnified by externalities and spillovers arising from greater area-wide financial integration.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">Second, experience has shown that, within a more integrated market, greater specialisation may imply that financial systems in one country outgrow the capacity of national taxpayers to support them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">The implications of this experience are profound.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">As I have argued, they point to the need for a much greater euro area and EU perspective in the supervisory and regulatory framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">While progress has been made in this domain, much remains to be done.</span>
