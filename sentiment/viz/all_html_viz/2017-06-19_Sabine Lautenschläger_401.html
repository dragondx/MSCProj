    <span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)"> Cyber resilience – A banking supervisor’s view Statement by Sabine Lautenschläger, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB and Vice-Chair of the Supervisory Board of the ECB, at the High-Level Meeting on Cyber Resilience, Frankfurt am Main, 19 June 2017 This week I learnt that the first computer virus dates back to 1971.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">It spread via the ARPANET, which was a precursor of today’s internet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The ARPANET connected about two dozen universities and government hosts in the United States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.15,0)">The virus had been written for experimental purposes and was not malicious.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.04,0)">It just displayed a simple message on infected computers: “I’m the creeper: catch me if you can”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.58,0)">Things are a bit more complex today, and the outcome of cyber incidents much worse: they can disrupt business, cost a lot of money and destroy reputations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.9,0)">And indeed, the potential for damage is great, as so much relies on IT and so much happens online – the financial sector is a case in point.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">As you all know, banks have always been attractive targets for criminals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">Although the damage has been limited so far, we banking supervisors take cyber risk very seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">And we insist on banks doing the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,244.19,0)">Cyber risk has been a priority for ECB Banking Supervision from day one.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In 2015, we established a working group that had three goals.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">First, to get an overview of how supervisors deal with such risks both at national and international level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">Second, to get an overview of how prepared banks are for cyber risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">And third, to propose to the Supervisory Board a strategic direction and a dedicated work plan on cyber risk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">We have learnt a lot over the past two years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">And we have used it to address this risk from several different angles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">For us, one of the first steps was to establish a cyber incident reporting framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(47,255,0)">We conducted a successful pilot phase in 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">And now we will implement a long-term solution for all those banks that we directly supervise.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.61,0)">As from this summer, they will be required to report all significant cyber incidents.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">This will help us to assess more objectively how many incidents there are and how cyber threats evolve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(198,255,0)">It will also help us to identify vulnerabilities and common pitfalls.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In addition to our ongoing supervision we also perform thematic reviews on cyber security and IT outsourcing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">These reviews help us to assess the risks facing each bank as well as the risks that might affect the entire sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(192,255,0)">And they also help to raise awareness of cyber risk at Board level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">The insights that we obtained in 2015 and 2016 were applied in three ways.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">First, they informed a dedicated section in our methodology for on-site inspections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(221,255,0)">Second, they were used to create new analytical tools for our off-site supervisors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">And third, they were used to produce a cyber risk profile of each bank.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">So we are working to obtain a comprehensive picture of what is happening out there.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But how to deal with cyber risk?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Well, the World Health Organization says that the best way of stopping diseases from spreading is basic hygiene: washing your hands.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">And the same is true for IT.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Basic IT “hygiene” can take banks a long way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Have the latest updates been installed?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">Are passwords strong enough?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Have backups been made and their restoration tested?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,230.22,0)">Such simple things are so important, but often neglected.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">So we are taking a close look at our banks to see whether they are following the relevant standards and best practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.66,0)">And there are plenty of these; I cannot stress this enough.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(197,255,0)">We also work with the European Banking Authority, the EBA, on how to supervise cyber risk in an effective and harmonised manner across Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">As for the euro area, we plan to issue our supervisory expectations on how banks approach IT risks in general.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">And what we expect clearly goes beyond basic IT hygiene.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(191,255,0)">This will be an important step for two reasons.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(193,255,0)">First, it will help to forge a common understanding of IT risks between supervisors and banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(99,255,0)">And second, it will help to ensure a harmonised treatment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(88,255,0)">To increase awareness and to communicate our expectations, we will organise seminars and discussions with banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And we also look beyond the euro area, of course.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(164,255,0)">We cooperate with supervisors worldwide to align priorities and exchange best practices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">To sum up, we take cyber risk very seriously, and we approach it from various angles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">My advice to banks is to do the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">It is vital to be alert and ready to react.</span>
