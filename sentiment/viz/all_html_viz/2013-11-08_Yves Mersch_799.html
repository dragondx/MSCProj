    <h3> Speaker: Yves Mersch </h3>

    <span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)"> Intergenerational Justice in Times of Sovereign Debt Crises Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the Minsky Conference in Greeceorganised by the Levy Economics InstituteAthens, 8 November 2013 Ladies and gentlemen, The last time I gave a speech here in Athens was in early January 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.39,0)">How much the world has changed since then.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Yet it has not always changed in the ways that observers predicted.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,238.62,0)">I still remember clearly, in the early weeks of May 2010, the prophetic claims that Greece would leave the euro area within weeks, that other countries would follow within months, and that the collapse of the euro would be complete before the year was out.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">Those claims were wrong – and the Greek people have played an important part in proving them so.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(37,255,0)">Since the loss of market access in early 2010, the Greek people have made extraordinary efforts to refute the naysayers and turn the economy around.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)">They have executed a fiscal adjustment of historic proportions and embarked on the difficult road of structural reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(122,255,0)">The results of these actions have accrued first and foremost to Greece – but they have also accrued to the wider euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">However, this turnaround is still only half complete.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.27,0)">There is still much work to do.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">And what I would like to emphasise in my remarks today is that staying on the path of reform is essential not only for the citizens of today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It is also essential for those of tomorrow.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,33.94,0)">Like all Western societies, and some rapidly ageing Eastern ones, Greece faces long-term fiscal challenges linked to high public debt levels and demographic developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">These challenges raise profound questions about intergenerational justice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">And it is only through reforms that they can be answered in a fair way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">For all ageing societies, this implies, first, ensuring sustainable public finances and, second, achieving stronger economic growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Both are necessary because they are mutually reinforcing: fiscal sustainability creates the stability and confidence necessary for future growth; and higher growth creates the revenues and debt-to-GDP ratios necessary for fiscal sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Let me therefore deal with each in turn, starting with what is being done to ensure fiscal sustainability in the context of intergenerational justice.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Strengthening sustainability The fiscal challenges that Greece is facing today, while more severe than others, are not unique to this country.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,207.37,0)">All Western societies are being confronted with difficult questions about the distribution of consolidation and spending between current and future generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">A first question is how the burden of high public debt levels in Western societies will be shared between generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,64.47,0)">This question is particularly pertinent in the euro area because all countries are bound by law to start reducing their debts to below 60% of GDP – and average public debt levels in the euro area are currently in excess of 95% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(95,255,0)">If fiscal consolidation starts today, then the generation which has benefited most from this debt will play the largest role in reducing it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.56,0)">But if consolidation is delayed, then future generations will have to bear the burden of debt reduction – this would constitute a direct transfer from our children and grandchildren to ourselves.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">And it is only us who are taking the decision.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,235.23,0)">Our children and grandchildren have no power to raise their objections.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">A second question with intergenerational consequences is how to spread the costs of demographic change.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">In the EU, it is projected that by 2060 there will be just two working-age people for every person over 65, compared with a ratio of 4:1 today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.98,0)">This means the weight of supporting an ageing population will rest on ever fewer shoulders.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(33,255,0)">If current generations are proactive in reforming pension systems, they can reduce the load that the shrinking working age population will have to carry.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,69.29,0)">But if they choose instead to preserve their entitlements, then they make the lives of future generations commensurately harder.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.47,0)">They would be effectively sacrificing their descendants’ quality of life for their own.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.44,0)">In other words, all Western societies are facing choices about the distribution of responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">Do we, the current generation, take responsibility for the long-term fiscal challenges that we have played a large part in creating?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,184.14,0)">Or do we delay and pass the consequences of our choices onto our children and grandchildren?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">I think it is fairly clear what a perspective of intergenerational justice would imply.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">This perspective is of course not new.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,215.99,0)">The so-called “demographic time bomb” has been predictable for many years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Indeed, I pointed to this issue when I spoke here in Greece in early 2008.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">But what has changed today is the urgency for action.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The crisis has meant that these difficult choices can no longer be delayed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(82,255,0)">One might say it has pressed the fast-forward button and brought the challenges of the future into the present.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">This is the broader context for the ongoing consolidation process in Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">Certainly, it is about increasing spending control and tax collection.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">But it is also about putting Greece on a sustainable path for the future; limiting the load that is bequeathed to our descendants; and ensuring that those that created fiscal problems take responsibility for them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">What Greece has achieved And indeed, this is what is happening in Greece today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The commitment the Greek people have shown to fiscal consolidation has been remarkable, even in international comparison.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.9,0)">The primary deficit has declined by almost 10 percentage points of GDP between 2009 and 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(118,255,0)">Taking into account the deep and prolonged recession, the underlying fiscal adjustment has been even larger.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">The OECD estimates that structural adjustment was nearly 14 percentage points of GDP in this period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(212,255,0)">As Greece is one of the smaller euro area Member States, the scale of its efforts is not always appreciated appropriately.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,26.4,0)">If the level of expenditure consolidation we have seen in Greece were applied in Germany, it would be equivalent to a permanent reduction in public spending of 174 billion euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">That is more than the total sum of social spending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">Greece has also made important progress in addressing the long-term fiscal challenges linked to its ageing population.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,246.55,0)">There is little doubt that before the crisis the Greek pension system was unsustainable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In the Commission’s 2009 Ageing Report, age-related spending in Greece was projected to increase from 22% of GDP in 2007 to a staggering 38% of GDP in 2060.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,84.98,0)">By contrast, the average for the euro area would be under 30% of GDP in 2060.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(67,255,0)">But thanks to the pension reforms the authorities have introduced, the Greek system is now comparable to others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,59.87,0)">In the 2012 Ageing Report, age-related spending in Greece was projected to increase to just under 30% of GDP in 2060 – so around than 8 percentage points lower than the previous estimate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">This is almost identical to the euro area average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">If we take into account as well the recently legislated increase in the pension age, Greece may even be ahead of others.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">In short, the Greek people have taken vital measures to ensure long-term fiscal sustainability.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">This will reduce the burden that will be passed to future generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(56,255,0)">And I recognise that in doing so, current generations have made considerable sacrifices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.28,0)">Real earnings have fallen by over 20% between 2009 and 2012, undoing the gains made since adopting the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.59,0)">Far too many people are currently without work, with unemployment at over 27% and youth unemployment reaching 57%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,41.45,0)">For so much potential to be lying idle is a tragedy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,36.63,0)">What remains to be done Nevertheless, this is the painful cost of reversing the misguided economic policies and lack of reforms in the past.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(156,255,0)">And fiscal sustainability – and hence intergenerational justice – is not yet assured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">While the government appears to be on track to meet its 2013 primary balance target, Greece still has some way to go to reach the primary surplus targets of 1.5% of GDP in 2014, 3% of GDP in 2015 and 4.5% of GDP in 2016.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,179.26,0)">This means that fiscal consolidation has to continue.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.06,0)">Based on current projections, a fiscal gap has emerged for 2014.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.17,0)">It comes mainly from delayed gains from the tax administration reform, shortfalls in the collection of social security contributions and the continuing underperformance of the instalment schemes for outstanding tax obligations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.67,0)">Measures will have to be identified to close it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,49.18,0)">Looking forward, failure by the authorities to proceed with tax administration reform and to accelerate the fight against tax evasion will unavoidably widen the fiscal gap – and imply the need for higher savings on the expenditure side.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(44,255,0)">This simple truth should provide sufficient incentives for stepping up the pace of tax administration reform.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">To put tax collection in Greece in context, according to the most recent OECD data, the tax debt in Greece as a share of annual net tax revenue was almost 90% in 2010, compared with an OECD average of under 14%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">Fighting tax evasion now is therefore key to enhancing social fairness – both on an intra-generational and an inter-generational basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">To this effect, the recently legislated semi-autonomous tax agency will need to become fully operational and be shielded from political interference.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Beyond that, accelerating the implementation of public administration reform is key to the success of the wider reform agenda.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.12,0)">Significant delays have occurred in finalising staffing plans and transferring employees to the new mobility scheme, and this is slowing down the identification of redundant positions and the necessary modernisation of the public sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Of course, consolidation would be made easier by higher rates of growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">But we should not treat growth as an exogenous variable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">On the contrary, it depends critically on the decisions of the Greek authorities – namely on their willingness to implement the growth-enhancing measures in the programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,242.93,0)">The relatively closed and rigid nature of the Greek economy is both a challenge and an opportunity: it makes the process of reform harder, but it also means that the potential for reforms to raise growth is commensurately greater.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Let me therefore turn to the subject of growth, which forms the second part of my remarks today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Strengthening growth The economic situation in Greece has started to pick up this year, with the economy stabilising and seasonally-adjusted real GDP increasing by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in Q2 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Overall, GDP growth is expected to turn positive next year at 0.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.95,0)">But while these are welcome developments, they still represent a relatively weak recovery, especially given the depth of the recession that preceded it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">In my view, to add momentum to this recovery and lay the foundations for medium-term growth, the authorities need to address three challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(41,255,0)">First, increasing the economy’s external competitiveness; second, ensuring the banking sector can fund the recovery; and third, attracting productive foreign investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.29,0)">Increasing external competitiveness As Greece is undergoing a simultaneous deleveraging in its public and private sectors, sectoral accounting tells us that its external sector must go into surplus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(117,255,0)">The key for growth is to ensure that this happens as much as possible through higher exports rather than import compression.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">The best way Greece can achieve this is by improving its price competitiveness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(128,255,0)">Price competitiveness is particularly important for Greek firms as their exports are largely concentrated in low-tech products.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,39.69,0)">At the end of the last decade, high-tech or intermediate-tech products represented only 28% of total exports, compared to nearly 50% for the EU average.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.1,0)">Yet since euro entry price competitiveness in Greece has actually been on a worsening trend.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(102,255,0)">According to the Commission, the real effective exchange rate   in Greece was still rising until 2011.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(142,255,0)">To facilitate an export-led recovery, this trend has to be corrected and there is no way this can be achieved in the short run other than by adjusting prices and costs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,177.32,0)">I know the difficulties that such adjustment creates and the criticisms that are levelled against it.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">But we are in a monetary union and this is how adjustment works.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">Sharing a currency brings considerable microeconomic benefits but it requires that relative prices can adjust to offset shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This process has already begun in Greece today.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Thorough labour market reforms have reduced labour costs significantly.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.48,0)">costs have now fallen by around by 18% since 2009, with wage adjustment being the main driver of that fall.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,9.44,0)">Indeed, compensation per employee has fallen by about 20% in this period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">But the translation of cost competitiveness gains into prices has been too slow – notwithstanding the encouraging recent trend of disinflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,44.48,0)">This is largely because reforms in product markets have not kept pace with those in labour markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,32.94,0)">And this not only limits the potential for the external sector to generate growth, but also lowers citizens’ real incomes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Speeding up the pace of product market reforms is therefore a priority.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">The authorities have introduced several recent reforms, for example removing barriers to entry in transportation services, repealing restrictions in the retail sector and removing mandatory recourse to services for a number of regulated professions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.1,0)">However, as of today product market regulations are still among the most restrictive in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Further reform will help remove unjustified privileges and the related excess profits, and by helping prices adjust, this will in turn strengthen social fairness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(209,255,0)">Funding the recovery While product market reforms are an essential part of building a more competitive economy, their ability to generate growth depends also on other developments – in particular, the condition of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,70.0,0)">If banks do not make new loans, this impedes the entry of new players into liberalised sectors, which then reduces competitive pressures and price adjustments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.22,0)">And if banks do not write off loans to insolvent debtors, in particular “zombie” companies, this slows down the necessary reallocation of resources toward exports and higher-productivity sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">In other words, cleaning up bank balance sheets and ensuring a well-functioning bank lending channel is an equally important part of the adjustment process.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,221.23,0)">This is the second challenge for growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(73,255,0)">The authorities in Greece have taken important steps to preserve the stability of the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(90,255,0)">The recapitalisation of the four core banks was completed in June 2013, while the consolidation of the banking sector has continued through the resolution of non-viable banks and the absorption of Greek subsidiaries of foreign banks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Deposit inflows have continued, in part offsetting the deposits lost between the end of 2009 and the middle of 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.38,0)">But despite these improvements, credit growth to the private sector remains very weak, in particular for the small and medium-sized enterprises   that make up about 60% of business turnover in Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,113.31,0)">The last ECB survey on SME financing showed that 31% of SMEs had applications for bank loans rejected, well above the euro area average of 11%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.02,0)">Moreover, the sectoral allocation of credits has not substantially shifted towards export-oriented sectors since 2010, suggesting that banks are not facilitating internal rebalancing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,21.19,0)">To some extent, these developments are cyclical: the weak economic environment means banks are attaching higher credit risk to SMEs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">But there is also a more structural explanation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Non-performing loans   increased from 16% at the end of 2011 to 29% of total loans in the first quarter of 2013.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.39,0)">This is acting as a barrier to new lending to higher- growth sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,181.68,0)">Unfortunately, this problem is in part being created by government policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.74,0)">The ongoing moratorium on auctioning the properties of debtors in default has slowed down resolution of NPLs and balance sheet restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,106.58,0)">Moreover, suggestions by policy-makers about horizontal debt relief for bank debtors are leading to a steep rise in strategic defaults, with banks estimating that 25% of NPLs in the mortgage and SME sectors are now strategic.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,30.8,0)">This deterioration in the payment culture, even if it helps individuals on a micro level, is deeply damaging to the economy as a whole.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,13.48,0)">If it continues, it will ultimately lead to higher costs for banks, new recapitalisation needs and further constrictions in bank lending.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(239,255,0)">In my view, to restart lending to the real economy, this self-fulfilling cycle must be broken.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">I welcome the fact that the Greek authorities have established an inter-agency working group to identify ways to improve the effectiveness of debt resolution processes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">Its priority should be to establish a time-bound framework to facilitate the settlement of borrower arrears using standardised protocols.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">This would help to remove expectations about future debt relief, and as such, remove the debilitating moral hazard this is creating.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,24.76,0)">Otherwise, the ultimate result would be that excessively high risk premia become structural and choke off investment and job creation – thus punishing the whole of society for the actions of those in strategic default.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(159,255,0)">Attracting productive foreign investment The third challenge for growth is to attract higher foreign investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(20,255,0)">This is important to add momentum to the recovery in the short term, while also increasing the capital and knowledge base of the Greek economy over the medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.68,0)">Indeed, before the crisis, investment in knowledge-based capital in Greece was among the lowest in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">From the available signals, there seems to be significant investor interest in Greece.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,55.88,0)">While total investment in Greece has fallen by around 43% from 2008-2012, foreign direct investment   flows have recently been positive, driven largely by investment in the banking sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">But anecdotal evidence suggests that foreign interest in the real economy is also growing, with several multinational companies announcing plans to increase their output at Greek units in the coming years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(180,255,0)">To maximise such investments, I see three actions as key.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(199,255,0)">First, the authorities need to redouble their efforts to improve the business environment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">Product and labour market flexibility is certainly a part of this, but there is also a wider challenge related to reducing bureaucracy, red tape and corruption.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Progress has been made in these areas but Greece still ranks second to last among euro area countries on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business Index.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Second, foreign investment would naturally rise if privatisation were increased.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.75,0)">In 2012 only 0.1 billion euro was derived from privatisation receipts, instead of the 3.6 billion euro originally forecast.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(140,255,0)">Yet the example of the Port of Piraeus shows what well-targeted privatisation can achieve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Since the transfer of management of part of the port to the company COSCO in 2009, container traffic has tripled and its market share in the Mediterranean has risen from 2% to 6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(135,255,0)">Third, it is crucial for foreign investors that uncertainty about Greece’s medium-term outlook is dispelled.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,14.62,0)">The greatest source of such uncertainty in the past was persistent questions about Greece’s place in the euro area, but thanks to the joint efforts at the European and national levels, this seems to have significantly declined over the last year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The main source of uncertainty today is the continued commitment of the authorities to the programme.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(97,255,0)">I therefore trust that the authorities will do everything possible to remove such doubts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Conclusion Let me conclude.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">Greece has made tremendous progress in recent years to close its fiscal deficit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(107,255,0)">By any standards, what has been achieved is remarkable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">But the process of restoring sustainability and growth in Greece is not yet complete – and neither is the progress so far secured.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.46,0)">If the authorities fail to address the remaining challenges, they will put at risk what has already been achieved.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(235,255,0)">In other words, Greece today stands at a crossroads.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.76,0)">In the one direction lies the path of difficult choices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">This is the steep and thorny way, and it requires great commitment to negotiate, but it is the one that will lead to a reformed state, a sustainable economy and justice between generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">In the other direction lies the path of easy answers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.22,0)">This path is littered with false alternatives, such as recurrent proposals for debt restructuring.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,183.47,0)">To some, debt restructuring or larger haircuts on government bonds may seem politically attractive.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.33,0)">But such practices can only be a last resort.</span><span

help to promote fiscal discipline and could create higher costs in the long run.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,42.48,0)">And they would do nothing to address the fundamental weaknesses

generations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(216,255,0)">From what I see today, I trust that the Greek people know which path they need to take.</span><span style="background-color:
