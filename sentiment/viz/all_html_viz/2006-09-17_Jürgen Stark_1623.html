    <span style="background-color: rgb(175,255,0)"> Key issues facing the global economy outlook for the European economy: regaining prominence in the global economy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(173,255,0)">Presentation by Jürgen StarkMember of the Executive Board of the ECB2006 Annual Membership Meeting of the IIFSingapore, 17 September 2006 To start with, for me the answer to the question put forward in the headline is a clear “Yes”: the euro area will in my view indeed gain prominence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">In the next few minutes I will explain why.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.08,0)">My first slide presents the latest macroeconomic projections prepared by ECB staff.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">Regarding economic activity, it is projected that real GDP in the euro area will stabilise at growth rates which are largely in line with potential growth over the projection horizon.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">This view is shared by other international institutions, such as the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">More specifically, real GDP growth is projected to be in a range between 2.2% and 2.8% this year, which is a significant improvement compared to the growth rate of 1.5% observed in 2005.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">According to Eurostat, the official statistical institute for the EU, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, real GDP grew by 0.9% in the euro area in the second quarter of 2006, following strong growth also in the first quarter   – thus leading to an annualised growth rate of 3½% in the first half of 2006, which is the fastest pace in more than 5 years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In particular, domestic demand has contributed strongly   to this favourable development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">This confirms the view that euro area economic growth has been now more broadly based and also self-sustained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(137,255,0)">Survey-based indicators of consumer and business confidence in both the industrial and services sectors – suggest an ongoing, but possibly less vibrant, real GDP growth in the second half of this year, more in line with estimates of potential growth, i.e.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">of around ½ % quarter on quarter.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">Regarding 2007, staff projections suggest real GDP growth between 1.6% and 2.6%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,251.33,0)">The expected moderation between 2006 and 2007 largely reflects the impact of fiscal measures adopted by the German government.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">These measures include most importantly an increase in the standard VAT rate from 16% to 19% as of January 2007, but entail also cuts to social security contributions and some additional expenditures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The fiscal package is expected to have a direct positive effect on the German fiscal balance of about 0.7% of nominal GDP in 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">Looking at the driving factors of euro area growth, exports should continue to benefit from robust global economic activity.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">This, together with favourable financing conditions, high profits and still high levels of business confidence, should also support investment growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">In addition, growth in private consumption should be sustained by improvements in employment and increases in real disposable income.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Overall, conditions remain in place for a solid, self-sustained growth path over the short to medium term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,66.5,0)">Risks to the economic growth projection are broadly balanced over the shorter term, while longer-term downside risks relate mainly to persistant high oil price increases, to disorderly unwinding of global imbalances and protectionist pressure, especially after the suspension of the Doha round of trade talk.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">Let me here briefly refer to the euro area’s current account balances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(168,255,0)">In June 2006, the 12-month cumulated current account of the euro area shifted to a deficit of around 0.5% of GDP from a surplus of 0.3% of GDP a year earlier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,34.5,0)">This shift resulted mainly from a decline in the goods surplus reflecting the significant rise in the cost of oil imports and the associated deterioration in the oil trade deficit in particular vis-à-vis oil exporting countries such as OPEC and Russia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.25,0)">Let me also tackle briefly the developments in the euro area labour market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">All available data point to an ongoing improvement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,10.82,0)">For example, the unemployment rate has fallen continuously since mid-2004 from 8.9% to 7.8% in July this year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,8.82,0)">The number of unemployed persons has declined by 1.5 million over the same period to stand in July below 11.5 million.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">We have seen also a strengthening in euro area employment over the past year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(18,255,0)">More recently, employment grew by 0.4 % quarter-on-quarter in the second quarter of this year, following increases of 0.3% in the previous two quarters.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(24,255,0)">Employment is expected to continue growing at this pace for some time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(155,255,0)">From a longer term perspective, since the start of the European Monetary Union in January 1999, the euro area economy has created about 11 millions of new jobs  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">It is worth mentioning that this is more than in the US over the same period of time.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">Labour productivity growth continued to rise in the second quarter of the year, to 1.4% in annual terms, on account of growing employment and activity in the last few quarters, particularly in the industrial sector.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,11.71,0)">Notwithstanding these recent increases, there has been a slowdown in labour productivity growth in the euro area since the mid-1990 which contrasts with gains in productivity in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,73.52,0)">However, on the basis of comparable measures for both economies the gap in productivity growth between the euro area and the US seems to have narrowed recently, most probably due to a recent slowdown in the US productivity growth rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">This gap is expected to narrow further in the coming years, reflecting different cyclical developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(138,255,0)">Turning to the outlook for price developments, the slide shows that HICP inflation is projected to be at an elevated level of 2.4% in both 2006 and 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,101.04,0)">Headline inflation has been at or just above 2% over the last few years and at 2.2% in August 2006.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">The current and expected elevated levels of inflation reflect to a large extent the impact of the strong increase in commodity prices.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,19.48,0)">These developments have put direct upward pressure on the energy component of the HICP and to upward price pressure along the production chain.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">This becomes evident from recent high growth rate in producer prices, which are just below 6%, and gradually rising non-energy goods prices at the producer and consumer level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">Moreover, survey indicators suggest that companies are more and more able to pass higher input costs on to customers, indicating increased pricing power in the light of capacity constraints and buoyant demand.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">These indirect effects are expected to have a significant upward effect on inflation in the course of next year, together with the impact of the VAT increase in Germany.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">At the same time inflation measured by the HICP excluding unprocessed food and energy – an indicator of underlying inflationary pressures – has remained more moderate, at levels just above 1.5%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(21,255,0)">In particular, moderate wage growth contributed to this development.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(124,255,0)">In the first quarter of 2006, the annual rate of growth in euro area compensation per employee stood at 2.0%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In particular, two factors helped to contain inflationary pressure emanating from the labour market: First, strong international competition, particularly in the manufacturing sector, and a still high, albeit declining, unemployment rate in the euro area contributed to moderate wage growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">And second, increases in labour productivity growth kept unit labour cost growth at very subdued levels  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,100.3,0)">Turning to inflation expectations, short-term inflation expectations have drifted somewhat upwards recently.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">However, as the slide shows, longer-term inflation expectations have remained solidly anchored at levels consistent with a high degree of credibility of the ECB’s monetary policy as regards the maintenance of price stability in the medium-term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">All available measures of long-term inflation expectations consistently point to expectations of continued low and stable inflation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(34,255,0)">Overall, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels in the remainder of 2006 and on average in 2007.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,98.98,0)">Risks to this outlook are clearly on the upside.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,81.8,0)">In particular, the following upside risks prevail: higher than currently expected increases in energy and non-energy commodity prices, a potentially stronger pass-through of past oil price increases into consumer prices than currently anticipated, further increases in indirect taxes and administered prices, and – more fundamentally – potential second round effects due to stronger than expected wage developments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">Regarding prospects for inflation over medium to longer horizons, the monetary analysis continues to confirm that upside risks to price stability prevail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">The rates of monetary and credit expansion remain rapid, reflecting the still low level of interest rates in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(40,255,0)">In particular, loans to the private sector continue to grow at double-digit rates on an annual basis, with this rapid growth remaining broadly based across the household and corporate sectors.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,63.22,0)">The moderation of annual M3 growth observed in the past two months – to 8.5% in June and 7.8% in July – may possibly reflect the impact of previous increases in interest rates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(50,255,0)">However, it also needs to be viewed against the high growth rate witnessed in May, which represented one of the highest annual rates of M3 growth seen since the introduction of the euro.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(101,255,0)">However, recent monetary developments should be assessed with the appropriate medium-term perspective, and thus against the background of the persistent upward trend in the underlying rate of monetary expansion observed since mid-2004.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">On this basis, liquidity in the euro area remains ample by all reasonable measures.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Continued strong monetary and credit growth in the context of still ample liquidity points to upside risks to price stability over the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(68,255,0)">Monetary developments therefore require careful monitoring, especially against the background of improved economic conditions and strong property market developments in many parts of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,140.31,0)">What are the consequences for monetary policy?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">The economic analysis underlying the ECB’s Governing Council assessment suggests that inflation in the euro area is likely to remain elevated, at rates above 2%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.12,0)">Moreover, as I mentioned, risks to the outlook for price developments remain clearly on the upside over the medium to longer term.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,250.1,0)">In its meeting on 31 August, the Governing Council stated that if its assumptions and baseline scenario continue to be confirmed, a progressive withdrawal of monetary accommodation will remain warranted so as to adjust the still accommodative stance of the ECB’s monetary policy and to address the risks to price stability identified in the economic and monetary analyses.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(207,255,0)">Regarding fiscal policy, all euro area Member States are committed to fiscal discipline and to complying with the fiscal rules enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,17.3,0)">Over recent years in particular the three largest euro area countries had difficulties in complying with the rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(15,255,0)">As a consequence the euro area general government deficit rose to 3% of GDP and the debt-to-GDP ratio increased to above 70% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(16,255,0)">At least as far as nominal budget balances are concerned, the situation in the euro area is now starting to improve.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.89,0)">In 2005, the euro area general government deficit was reduced from 2.8% to 2.4% of GDP.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(17,255,0)">But this improving fiscal outlook owes primarily to the favourable economic environment and, in a number of countries, especially from buoyant revenues boosted by profit-related taxes.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,111.62,0)">The contribution to the improving fiscal outlook from structural consolidation has been much more limited.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(167,255,0)">It is therefore worth recalling that at the time of the EU’s fiscal rule book revision just a year and a half ago, the commitment to undertake greater fiscal consolidation in "good times" was seen as an important new element.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(31,255,0)">Euro area governments now have to translate their good words into action and seize the opportunity provided by the current favourable economic environment to make rapid progress towards sound budgetary positions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">Finally, let me stay a moment with structural reforms, a key domain for euro area policy makers, not least in view of the global challenges.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(38,255,0)">The benefits of structural reforms for the smooth functioning of the euro area are clear: First of all, they raise the pace at which economies can grow and create jobs without creating inflationary pressures; Second, they help workers and firms to respond in a flexible way to the key challenges from rapid technological progress, globalisation and ageing populations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(32,255,0)">Finally, they help the euro area economy to increase its resilience to shocks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">My last slide shows some indicators covering structural policy areas such as labour market and product market regulation, for the euro area and the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">The figures on regulation show that the euro area has made quite some progress in both the labour and the product market over the last couple of years.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,60.9,0)">Although they still lag behind the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,115.08,0)">However, as the table shows, only 1.9% of euro area GDP was pent on R&D in 2003, against the 2.7% recorded in the US.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(153,255,0)">However, a closer look at the same indicators at a country level and the comparison to the US “benchmark” suggest that much more should be done.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Indeed, continuous effort and determination in pursuing structural reforms is needed in several euro area countries, in order to foster growth and employment and to close the still significant gap with the targets set by the Lisbon strategy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(60,255,0)">The priority areas for reform in Europe are: getting more people into work; increasing competition; unlocking business potential; boosting innovation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(25,255,0)">Structural reforms focussing on these areas will increase potential growth and will help Europe to fully exploit the benefits of the EU Internal Market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">All in all, I am confident about the economic prospects of the euro area and its contribution to a rebalancing of global growth.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">However, the preconditions that have to be met are obvious: not to losing momentum in ongoing structural reform efforts, structural improvement of fiscal positions, last but not least maintaining price stability.</span>
