    <span style="background-color: rgb(255,249.61,0)"> Crisis prevention: IMF surveillance, need for new teeth?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,92.79,0)">Statement by Professor Otmar Issing Member of the Executive Board of the European Central Bank at the IMF conference on The role of the IMF in the world economy to be held in Frankfurt am Main on July 2, 1998 For a year now, the international community has been kept in suspense by the crises in Asia.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">Despite very large-scale assistance measures and initial successes in achieving stability in some countries, an overall calming of the situation has not yet been accomplished.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.35,0)">Crisis management - this morning's subject - is still what is needed most.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Nevertheless, it does seem both sensible and necessary to look forward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">Is there a better way of preventing financial crises in future?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.81,0)">And if so, how?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">What lessons can be learned, especially with regard to IMF surveillance?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">Is surveillance effective?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(184,255,0)">Can it - or, indeed, does it have to be intensified and improved?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.55,0)">Not just more recent events - the collapse of Barings Bank, the peso crisis in Mexico and, now, turbulence in Asia - but also earlier ones in banking and monetary history force us to the conclusion that - in a market system - financial crises of one sort or another repeatedly occur under certain circumstances.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.27,0)">Their specific causes are extremely varied .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">Nevertheless, they do have some features in common.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,28.95,0)">The IMF, in an interesting analysis in the latest World Economic Outlook, points out that serious turbulence in the financial markets is frequently caused by unsustainable economic imbalances and misalignments of asset prices or exchange rates accompanied by rigidities in the financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(245,255,0)">According to this study, whether these undesirable developments actually lead to a financial crisis depends on the scale of the imbalances themselves, on a credible policy for a timely removal of the imbalances, and on the robustness of the country's financial system.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Precautions are therefore necessary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">The key to every type of crisis prevention and crisis management lies in the history leading up to financial crises.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,217.57,0)">Policymakers must give a prompt and decisive response to macroeconomic imbalances before their scale triggers abrupt reversals of sentiment in the markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The financial system must be healthy and stable so that it does not itself become a source of crisis in the event of a change in the underlying conditions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The build-up of macroeconomics imbalances must be identified at as early a stage as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The role of surveillance This is ultimately the crucial rationale for surveillance by the international community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">The analysis of global economic developments undertaken by the IMF aims to identify potential adverse macroeconomic trends; it will then be incumbent on the national authorities of the countries concerned to tackle these imbalances as early as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">In the bilateral talks between the IMF's representatives and national authorities  , the economic policy of the latter will be under close scrutiny.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">This macroeconomic approach to surveillance has to be seen in the context of the IMF's task of granting conditional financial assistance in the event of balance of payments disequilibria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.21,0)">This approach is important and necessary, but - in its traditional form - it will not be adequate for the future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(223,255,0)">In particular, more attention will have to be paid to international capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">Inclusion of international capital flows in surveillance Advances in electronic data processing and the liberalisation of financial transactions have led to an enormous swelling of cross-border capital flows.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(26,255,0)">Some developing countries and emerging economies have become net importers of capital on a grand scale in the nineties - and it is not only foreign direct investment that has risen sharply; there has been a considerable increase in portfolio investment and in short-term financial credits, too.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(53,255,0)">The increased financial investments in the emerging markets have to be seen against the backdrop of falling nominal interest rates in the industrial countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,96.19,0)">The yields demanded by investors have possibly not declined to the same extent - in many minds, a complete break with the excessive   yields experienced in the past as a result of inflation does not appear to have taken place yet.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,222.97,0)">By an "admixture" of high-yielding assets, professional investors are evidently attempting to approach their traditional yield level.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(19,255,0)">Initially, it may indeed have made economic sense to increase investment in emerging markets; after all, such countries offered attractive earnings prospects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,22.12,0)">However, "herd behaviour" among the investors results in pressure on the spreads, which are then no longer an adequate reflection of the risk differentials between countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Although asset management has become more professional in the nineties, it has also become more one-sided in a certain respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(144,255,0)">An ever greater volume of financial resources is being managed according to comparatively similar criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(161,255,0)">Orientation towards a more or less exogenous benchmark and fierce competition among institutional investors compel the latter in many cases to behave in a similar fashion - no one wants to perform less well "than the market".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(226,255,0)">As long as this short-termism prevails in the market, "conservative" portfolio managers will have little to benefit from swimming against the current and forgoing yield opportunities in order to avoid risks that are difficult to calculate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,23.79,0)">The market is interested only in today's benchmark, and anyone who fails to hold his own now will soon find himself out of business - long before a long-term strategy could pay off.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,189.62,0)">Given these market conditions, reversals of opinion have a considerably wide impact.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,87.18,0)">They do not just affect the operations of individual investors, but seize hold of certain categories of institutional investors simultaneously - and repeatedly have serious repercussions not only for individual countries, but also for entire regions or groups of economies on account of spillover and contagion effects.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">Pointing out risks of this kind in connection with international capital flows must be a key element of IMF surveillance and will be so in future.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(100,255,0)">Although the IMF will not be breaking new ground in this respect, placing greater emphasis on aspects of capital flows and the financial markets in the context of surveillance will require a suitable analytical framework as well as a readiness for transparency on the part of the member countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,237.32,0)">Above all, it will be crucial to keep adequate track of how financial market players behave under changing conditions; this is because a system of surveillance and the provision of a framework in the area of international financial transactions that do not take account of market forces will meet with little success.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">One should also be aware of the limitations of this kind of extended surveillance, however.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,129.42,0)">Market movements are quick and sharp and spread rapidly, making forecasts of trends in cross-border capital flows and financial markets especially difficult.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">We can take it for granted that the IMF - despite all its expertise - will not always be right in its estimates.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,152.71,0)">For that reason, the international community will, in the final analysis, not be able to relieve market players from making an independent assessment of the situation.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,219.02,0)">To what extent the IMF should make specific warnings public is still being debated in depth; a tiered response in the case of countries whose policy gets completely out of hand is under discussion.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,155.0,0)">Basically, the IMF is in a dilemma in this respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,236.27,0)">Its warnings to a country would probably carry more weight if there were a threat of their being made public.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,137.37,0)">At the same time, however, announcing them publicly might trigger the very crisis that surveillance was actually meant to prevent.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(195,255,0)">Necessity of improved transparency in finance Efficient surveillance by the IMF, just like rational decisions on the part of investors, presupposes comprehensive and reliable information on the financial circumstances not just of individual market players but also of entire economies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(39,255,0)">The IMF has now extended its proposals on this and offered its support in implementing them.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(86,255,0)">It is now up to the member countries seeking access to the international capital market to implement these standards speedily and in full.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(251,255,0)">Transparency is to be understood as the debt which every country owes to the international community.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.54,0)">A matter to be considered is the extent to which the role of the IMF could or should be confined to defining the standard for supplying the data, monitoring compliance with this and pointing out any shortcomings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,252.51,0)">The evaluation itself could be left to the competition among the professional observers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,68.42,0)">The IMF would thereby be relieved of the dilemma of being at the centre of criticism, either as a "failure" if it does not give warnings in time or as a "trigger" of the crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">When the proposals to improve transparency are being implemented, the lenders must also be called upon to exert pressure and to apply the strictest criteria to their potential partners' policy on business openness.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,188.92,0)">Financial circumstances which are not very transparent must be construed as an additional risk of a credit exposure; those who still engage in transactions must not expect international assistance in the event of a crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,143.19,0)">Otherwise, the international community would be encouraging moral hazard.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">The efforts aimed at greater transparency and better surveillance by the IMF must not lead to negligence on the part of others either.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(224,255,0)">In particular, the technical support provided by the IMF in the implementation of the publication standards should not be misconstrued as a seal of approval.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,117.99,0)">Checking all transmitted data for accuracy would be beyond the capabilities of the IMF.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">The market players must use the available information, too: warnings must be heard and crisis signals taken seriously.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(104,255,0)">The creditors themselves can make a major contribution to greater transparency.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">Would it not be feasible and practical if international lenders were to report their exposures to individual countries or borrowers to an independent credit register which, in turn, would return the aggregated data to the reporting institutions?</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">In this way, the problem of asymmetrical information could be solved - at least partially - without the confidential transaction data having to be revealed.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(230,255,0)">This would also provide an aid for comparing the statistical reports of debtor countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">In this way it would be comparatively easy to identify "black sheep".</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,38.76,0)">Enterprises, banks, even entire economies would be pilloried immediately if they failed to comply - or failed to comply in time - with internationally accepted publication standards; they would themselves cut off their access to the international sources of funding, as it were.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(154,255,0)">Improvement of banking supervision and good governance indispensable The recent crises have exposed the problem of currency mismatch as a crisis-intensifying element.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">Short-term foreign currency loans from abroad   were taken up for longer-term purposes   in the national currency  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(240,255,0)">The lenders trusted explicit or implicit guarantees with regard to the exchange rate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,31.81,0)">Considerable   losses occurred when the pegging of the exchange rate could no longer be maintained.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,20.41,0)">The call for a lender of last resort is fraught with problems in this situation since it is not a matter of bridging temporary liquidity difficulties but a genuine problem of profitability: at today's exchange rates, many of the investments made are no longer viable.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">What is called for here as a preventive measure is not a lender of last resort who is declared ex ante; rather, what is required is an efficient banking supervision and good governance geared to market economy criteria.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">Proposals for this are on the table.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">The Basle Committee on Banking Supervision has drawn up core principles for the supervision of credit institutions which provide a suitable framework.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">In view of the enormous economic costs of banking crises - in the worst cases, around 50 % of GDP had to be spent on rehabilitation costs; the cumulative losses in growth are estimated at almost 20 percentage points on average - it is in every country's own interests to gear its national regulatory and supervisory system to these tried-and-tested principles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(218,255,0)">Consideration ought to be given to whether the problem of banks'   foreign currency debt in emerging economies could be tackled in line with market principles by suitable capital adequacy standards for open foreign currency positions - without calling straightaway for a complete ban, as Tobin does, for example.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(57,255,0)">Efficient surveillance - less financing Strengthened surveillance and better prudential supervision do not necessarily imply a reduction in capital inflows into the developing countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,89.81,0)">Strict capital adequacy standards for banks - viewed in isolation - may limit the business volume and the borrowing opportunities of individual institutions in the international market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(172,255,0)">To the extent that investment risks are thereby reduced, however, they are also associated with positive external effects and, in that respect, make the procurement of capital easier.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.1,0)">In dynamic terms, moreover, it is clear that the banking, exchange rate and debt crises in the developing countries have resulted in heavily fluctuating net capital flows; years of high capital imports were followed by a complete drying-up of, at least, private inflows - in some cases, even a withdrawal of private capital.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(112,255,0)">A steady inflow is likely to entail much smaller adjustment costs than such extreme fluctuations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(247,255,0)">Apart from this, a warning should be given against a purely quantitative analysis in the area of external financing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(143,255,0)">Many countries do need foreign capital for their development; and large capital imports may be interpreted as an expression of optimistic expectations concerning a country's growth potential.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,16.02,0)">In the event of an abrupt reversal of sentiment, however, dependence on external financing may quickly turn out to be a source of crisis, especially as large imports of capital are always accompanied by corresponding deficits on current account.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)">What is crucial for sustained economic development, therefore, is not so much the amount, but rather the type of capital inflows and the use to which they are put; that is because, in the long term, investors expect market-related yields on their assets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(232,255,0)">It will be important to take adequate account of these factors in the reorientation of surveillance.</span>
