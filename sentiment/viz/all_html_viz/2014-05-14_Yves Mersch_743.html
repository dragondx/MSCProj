    <span style="background-color: rgb(237,255,0)"> Keynote speech Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the “Welt” Währungskonferenz,Berlin, 14 May 2014 Ladies and Gentlemen, Mutual trust is a precondition for effective cooperation between European institutions and between the national and European level – trust that each institution acts lawfully and within its area of responsibility.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The separation of powers as well as checks and balances are fundamental achievements of modern democracies.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,190.37,0)">But they do not mean that one authority acts vis-à-vis another in a spirit of mistrust and disrespect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,178.86,0)">Even though the title of today’s discussion   may suggest otherwise, the ECB cannot, must not and will not “save” states.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">Our actions are based on our monetary policy mandate, as defined in Article 127 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union  : the ECB is responsible for price stability in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(215,255,0)">Like almost all central banks in the industrialised world, the ECB enjoys a high degree of independence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">This independence is not a carte blanche for us central bankers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">It provides protection, so that we can fulfil our mission free of political influence.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">At the same time, this privilege of political independence has a price: absolute respect for the limits of our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">The most effective way to be accountable to citizens as an independent institution is to assess if and to what extent we fulfil our price stability mission.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(45,255,0)">And our results so far are beyond reproach.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(187,255,0)">We have various instruments at our disposal to help us do justice to our mandate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,248.83,0)">The purchase of government bonds in the primary market is explicitly not among them because the monetary financing of governments is prohibited under the EU Treaty.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">Our mandate nevertheless includes the possibility of buying, under the appropriate conditions, government bonds on the secondary market  , should this be necessary from a monetary policy perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">This option is explicitly stated in Article 18.1 of the ESCB/ECB Statute.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">To illustrate this clear monetary policy orientation of OMTs, let me briefly recall the situation on the European capital markets in summer 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,15.25,0)">Fears that the monetary union could break up had led to severe tensions on those markets.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,12.76,0)">The government bond market was particularly hard hit.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(176,255,0)">Risk premia for both long-term and short-term government bonds of some Member States reached unusually high levels.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,243.62,0)">In July 2012, the yield on Spanish government bonds with a two-year maturity was 6.6% at times; for Italian ones it was 5.1%.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Some of these spreads reflected the economic fundamentals of the respective Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,47.6,0)">However, the rapid rise in spreads in the first half of 2012 was also an expression of the fear, an unfounded one, that the euro area could break up.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">Model calculations – with all their uncertainties and weaknesses both inside and outside the ECB – show that spreads for two-year Spanish and Italian government bonds that cannot be explained by fundamentals were up to 2 percentage points in July 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.35,0)">The prices of government bonds affect the pricing of other securities, such as bank or corporate bonds – key variables in the functioning of monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,18.24,0)">Disruptions on the government bond market therefore also have an impact on the effectiveness of our monetary policy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">In summer 2012, our monetary policy signals were reaching some euro area countries in only a limited way.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,228.72,0)">Sometimes they did not even reach the real economy.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,77.09,0)">Our key interest rate had lost its guiding role.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">It was in these circumstances that we announced the OMTs as an option on 6 September 2012.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(58,255,0)">We wanted to be certain that we can live up to our monetary policy mandate for the entire euro area even in times of crisis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(163,255,0)">At that time, we clearly stipulated three conditions for OMTs: first, we will take them into consideration only to ensure that our monetary policy signals reach the real economy – in the whole of the euro area, as our mandate requires.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,247.53,0)">Second, OMTs will only be considered provided they are not undermined by short-term national interests, that is, if the Member State concerned strictly complies with an adjustment programme of the European Financial Stability Facility   or the European Stability Mechanism   and implements the corresponding macroeconomic, structural and budgetary reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.4,0)">Third, the Member State must have access to the bond market or be about to have access to it in order not to unduly interfere with the market price mechanism  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(233,255,0)">Just as long as these three conditions are met, the ECB may consider purchasing government bonds of the eligible Member States on the secondary market, if this should be necessary from a monetary policy perspective.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(253,255,0)">These three conditions – disrupted transmission of monetary policy, conditionality and market access – are thus necessary but in no way sufficient conditions for OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">The Governing Council will decide about the possibility of OMTs in each case independently and only bearing in mind monetary policy needs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">This monetary policy orientation is also reflected in the design of OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,245.68,0)">Should they be conducted, they are limited to maturities of one to three years because other Eurosystem monetary policy instruments are traditionally geared towards this short-term period.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(234,255,0)">OMTs also differ significantly from government bond purchases made by the EFSF or the ESM, which provide financial support to stressed countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(69,255,0)">The EFSF and the ESM render – under strict conditions – financial assistance in order to preserve financial stability and they can improve the financing conditions of the affected countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(244,255,0)">With OMTs, however, it is not a matter of aligning the financing conditions of the Member States of the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">OMTs do not aim to ensure uniform interest rates in the euro area.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">In a functioning market, risks are properly priced.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">OMTs should change nothing in that respect.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,223.44,0)">Therefore, fundamentally justified interest rate differences or default risk premia are not the focus.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,211.85,0)">OMTs should only cut unjustified interest rate peaks.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,201.43,0)">The ECB must not, cannot and will not replace the actions of democratically legitimised governments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(249,255,0)">On the contrary.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">OMTs are designed so that the market mechanism remains protected and the Member States are required to undertake necessary reforms.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,254.01,0)">Despite this clear monetary policy orientation, there is public discussion about the legality of OMTs.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,241.21,0)">Out of respect for the judicial system, I shall not make any comments on pending proceedings.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">And according to my sense of justice, it would also be to the judges’ credit to do the same.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(254,255,0)">That’s why I take up the words of Peter Huber, the Constitutional Court judge.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">The ECB will wait for the decision of the European Court of Justice in “all humility and calm”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(29,255,0)">And like him, I am very optimistic that the interaction between the ECB and the Court of Justice will lead to “a good result”.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(250,255,0)">Until then, we are not limited in our actions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,206.96,0)">In February, the Federal Constitutional Court submitted questions of a legal nature about the OMTs to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(236,255,0)">However, the Constitutional Court reserves the right to decide on the compatibility of OMTs with Germany’s constitution.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(145,255,0)">With its submission, the Federal Constitutional Court is acting in a spirit of shared responsibility within a partnership of European courts.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(246,255,0)">It respects the division of tasks between European and national legislation and can take the views of the European Court as the basis for its judgement.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.59,0)">Conversely, the European Court of Justice will observe the limits of its jurisdiction and not intervene in the remit of the Federal Constitutional Court.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">Legal and political cooperation between the public administrations of the Member States and the institutions of the European Union functions when we respect each other and trust that we will act in the interests of our respective mandates and in accordance with the applicable law.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This trust forms the basis of cooperation between Member States and between Member States and the European Union and its institutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(228,255,0)">It is based on the democratic values we share and which are explicitly laid down in the Copenhagen criteria for new Member States.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(178,255,0)">We should preserve this trusting relationship – which supports Europe as a diverse, complementary whole, founded on the European treaties.</span>
