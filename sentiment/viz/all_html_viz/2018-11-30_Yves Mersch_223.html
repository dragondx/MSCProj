    <span style="background-color: rgb(61,255,0)"> TIPS and the future of innovative retail payment solutions in Europe Speech by Yves Mersch, Member of the Executive Board of the ECB, at the TIPS launch event, Frascati  , 30 November 2018 Introduction Ladies and gentlemen, Today we celebrate the launch of TARGET Instant Payment Settlement  , a new component of the Eurosystem’s TARGET Services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(49,255,0)">Since the launch of the euro in 1999, the Eurosystem has greatly contributed to reshaping the European market infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">The Eurosystem’s first step was to integrate and consolidate large-value payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(242,255,0)">The first-generation TARGET system, and its successor TARGET2, provided a single platform for real-time gross settlement for euro payment transactions related to the Eurosystem’s monetary policy operations, as well as bank-to-bank and commercial transactions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(160,255,0)">Second, TARGET2 Securities harmonised post-trading services for financial instruments, bringing an end to complex cross-border settlement procedures and the problems caused by different settlement practices across countries.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(227,255,0)">In launching TIPS, the Eurosystem is acknowledging the changing reality that digitalisation is erasing the borders between wholesale and retail.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(219,255,0)">TIPS enables payment service providers to allow their customers to transfer funds across Europe in real time and around the clock, every day of the year.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">Work on developing and implementing TIPS started in June 2017 and the project was completed on time, on schedule and on scope.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(52,255,0)">We can be justly proud of launching TIPs today and have good reason to celebrate.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(28,255,0)">Banca d’Italia has been a strong partner in euro area infrastructure platforms since the introduction of the euro, and continues to be committed to the ever-closer integration of euro area economy for the common good.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">The building blocks for retail payments innovation in Europe With TIPS, we now have three strong building blocks in place for unleashing the potential for retail payments innovation in Europe.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">First, we have standardisation and harmonisation of business rules.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">The SEPA instant credit transfer scheme provides the common basis for the roll-out of innovative end-user solutions for retail payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(62,255,0)">One year after its launch, more than 2,000 payment service providers from 16 different countries have joined the scheme, proving their commitment by following the Euro Retail Payments Board guidance on instant payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(225,255,0)">This number represents roughly half of the payment service providers and we expect that the other half will follow as soon as possible.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(127,255,0)">Second, we have a state-of-the-art market infrastructure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(217,255,0)">TIPS is a truly domestic market infrastructure for pan-European instant payments with settlement in central bank money.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(238,255,0)">There are flexible options for interaction with TIPS, allowing different kinds of market actors to access the platform in different roles.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(158,255,0)">Using TARGET2 as a basis, TIPS can provide wide reach and scale, tapping into an established network of over 1,700 participants and more than 51,000 addressable Business Identifier Codes  .</span><span style="background-color: rgb(196,255,0)">Third, we have a sound legal basis.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(241,255,0)">The revised Payment Services Directive   provides the legal framework for retail payments innovation by setting rules for third-party payment service providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(23,255,0)">PSD2 enhances consumer protection and increases security for payment services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,229.3,0)">But it is not yet fully implemented.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(203,255,0)">With these three strong building blocks in place, there is little excuse for not using this potential to provide pan-European services.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,253.57,0)">Let me be clear: it is not sufficient for banks to simply adopt the scheme and connect to TIPS in order that their customers may receive instant payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(231,255,0)">And neither is it sufficient to only provide the core SEPA instant credit transfer as a faster alternative to the SEPA credit transfer.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(54,255,0)">What is required is to tap into the potential of growing payment volumes and the opening-up of the payments market to new service providers under PSD2.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(177,255,0)">We invite all payment service providers to offer solutions that meet customers’ needs for immediate   payment services, e.g.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(252,255,0)">for e-commerce or person-to-person mobile payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,234.19,0)">The future of retail payments services in Europe The way we pay and want to pay in Europe is changing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(243,255,0)">Many consumers are moving to e-commerce and ever more e-retail payments are made from mobile phones.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(123,255,0)">Consumers expect pan-European services that are safe, efficient and easy to use.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(35,255,0)">PSD2 sought to facilitate innovative retail payments services by further levelling the playing field for new players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,50.69,0)">However, this objective seems to have met with resistance from banks, which are taking a defensive attitude regarding technical access for new and innovative third-party service providers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,145.58,0)">Such resistance limits the ability of European fintech companies to provide innovative, efficient and customer-friendly solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,46.66,0)">Moreover, we are often told that pressure on margins is increasing.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(210,255,0)">Some European providers are following a self-defeating strategy by setting higher prices for euro area solutions than their non-European counterparts charge for non-euro area solutions.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(22,255,0)">But as I have stated before, the current growth in payment volumes may offset some of the pressure.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(106,255,0)">Furthermore, instant payment solutions are a viable alternative to cards in e-commerce.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(181,255,0)">We need to see a shift of mindset in Europe regarding the role of payments.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(220,255,0)">We need to look at payments from a more strategic perspective rather than focusing purely on operations.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(248,255,0)">There is no such thing as a free lunch.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(108,255,0)">The overhaul of existing internal systems and procedures required to move retail payments from batch-processing into the real-time universe is an investment.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(64,255,0)">However, in evaluating the necessary expenditure for modernising payment service providers’ internal payments infrastructure, we must consider that it will not only benefit payments but also all the products and services that banks can offer to their customers.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(204,255,0)">In a world increasingly dominated by open banking, payments are an anchor for customer relationship management and a key driver for cross-selling.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(27,255,0)">To successfully compete with international providers of innovative retail payment solutions, European payment service providers urgently need to bring their internal systems up to par.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(72,255,0)">Conclusions With the launch of TIPS, the Eurosystem has laid the groundwork for innovative, customer-friendly retail payment solutions for the benefit of European citizens.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(206,255,0)">European payment service providers must make use of the opportunities offered by Europe’s state-of-the-art market infrastructure rather than leaving the field to international players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,225.5,0)">This has nothing to do with protectionism.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(136,255,0)">On the contrary, as long as they fulfil the regulatory requirements, we remain open to global players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,239.26,0)">But we need to address the reasons for the scarcity of major European players in the payments market.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(229,255,0)">If there is a lack of investment capacity for overhauling internal legacy systems that do not seamlessly function in a real-time payments era, we should not shy away from pooling resources and volumes and creating bigger players.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(255,220.33,0)">Focusing on national markets alone would be a step backward.</span><span style="background-color: rgb(200,255,0)">We have to think global and seek to develop global solutions that are based on European open governance and use European infrastructure.</span>
